  ABSTRACT = {The high-latitude regions of Antarctica remain among the most remote, extreme, and least explored areas on Earth. Still, microbial life has been reported in these environments, with limited information on their genetic properties and functional capabilities. Although diverse autochthonous multidrug-resistant bacteria were found in Antarctic Peninsula soils, posing whether these soils could act as a source of resistance determinants that could emerge among pathogens, we still lack information regarding the resistome of areas closer to the South Pole. Moreover, no previous studies have evaluated the pathogenic potential of microbes inhabiting Antarctic soils. In this work, we combined metagenomic and culture-dependent approaches to investigate the microbial diversity, resistome, virulome, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in soils from Union Glacier, a cold desert in West Antarctica. Despite the extreme conditions, several bacterial phyla were found, predominating Actinomycetota and Pseudomonadota, with limited archaeal and fungal taxa. Contrastive with Ecology Glacier soils from King George Island, the Union Glacier soil bacterial community is significantly less diverse, mainly attributed to scarce moisture. We recovered >80 species-level representative genomes (SRGs) of predominant bacteria and an ammonia-oxidating nitrogen- and carbon-fixing archaeon from a novel species of Nitrosocosmicus. Several resistance and virulence genes were found in Union Glacier soils, similar to those in other Antarctic cold desert areas but significantly distinct from those observed in maritime Antarctica and other non-cryosphere biomes. Furthermore, we characterized bacterial isolates resistant to up to 24 clinical antibiotics, mainly Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Plantibacter, and Flavobacterium. Moreover, some isolates produced putative virulence factors, including siderophores, pyocyanins, and exoenzymes with hemolytic, lecithinase, protease, and DNAse activity. This evidence uncovers a largely unexplored resistome and virulome hosted by deep Antarctica's soil microbial communities and the presence of bacteria with pathogenic potential, highlighting the relevance of One Health approaches for environmental surveillance in this continent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract: The chemical and microbiological properties of urban soils (Urbic Technosols) of Murmansk (Russia) are compared with those in podzols (Albic Podzols) of the background area. Urban soils display increased pH values and higher contents of major biogenic elements: C, N, P, and K, especially pronounced in subsoil horizons. In the urban topsoils, the number of cultured bacteria are increased (saprotrophs, to 3–6 × 106 CFU/g and oligotrophs, to 4.5–8 × 106 CFU/g), whereas the number of cultured microscopic fungi are decreased by two orders of magnitude (to 103 CFU) as compared with native podzols. As for the urban subsoil horizons, the number of all groups of microorganisms are increased as compared with the background. The diversity of micromycete complexes in urban soils follows the same pattern. Spatial nonuniformity of the species composition and structure of microfungal complexes is observed in the urban topsoils versus the subsoils, which display a relative uniformity of the dominant species composition (Trichocladium griseum, relative abundance of 41–77%). The share and abundance of BSL-1 and BSL-2 opportunistic micromycetes increase in the urban topsoils to 50–60% versus native podzols with the share of 30%. The degree of mycological hazard in urban soils varies from dangerous to safe (index of mycological hazard Im values are from 7–20 in the city center to 1.5–3.6 in the suburbs). The results demonstrate that urbanization in the Arctic not only changes the chemical properties of soils but also creates a new niche for microorganisms in subsoil horizons. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microorganisms that inhabit the cold Antarctic environment can produce ligninolytic enzymes potentially useful in bioremediation. Our study focused on characterizing Antarctic bacteria and fungi from marine sediment samples of King George and Deception Islands, maritime Antarctica, potentially affected by hydrocarbon influence, able to produce enzymes for use in bioremediation processes in environments impacted with petroleum derivatives. A total of 168 microorganism isolates were obtained: 56 from sediments of King George Island and 112 from Deception Island. Among them, five bacterial isolates were tolerant to cell growth in the presence of diesel oil and gasoline and seven fungal were able to discolor RBBR dye. In addition, 16 isolates (15 bacterial and one fungal) displayed enzymatic emulsifying activities. Two isolates were characterized taxonomically by showing better biotechnological results. Psychrobacter sp. BAD17 and Cladosporium sp. FAR18 showed pyrene tolerance (cell growth of 0.03 g mL−1 and 0.2 g mL−1) and laccase enzymatic activity (0.006 UL−1 and 0.10 UL−1), respectively. Our results indicate that bacteria and fungi living in sediments under potential effect of hydrocarbon pollution may represent a promising alternative to bioremediate cold environments contaminated with polluting compounds derived from petroleum such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dyes. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2023.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctic soil represents an important reservoir of filamentous fungi (FF) species with the ability to produce novel bioactive lipids. However, the lipid extraction method is still a bottleneck. The objective of the present work was to isolate and identify cultivable FF from Antarctic soils, to assess the most effective methods for fatty acid (FA) extraction, and to characterise the obtained lipids. A total of 18 fungal strains belonging to the Botrytis, Cladosporium, Cylindrobasidium, Mortierella, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, and Talaromyces genera and the Melanommataceae family were isolated and identified. The Folch, Bligh and Dyer, and Lewis extraction methods were assessed, and methyl esters of FA (FAMEs) were obtained. The Lewis method was the best in recovering FAMEs from fungal biomass. A total of 17 FAs were identified, and their chemical compositions varied depending on fungal species and strain. Oleic, linoleic, stearic, and palmitic acids were predominant for all fungal strains in the three assessed methods. Among the analysed strains, Cylindrobasidium eucalypti, Penicillium miczynskii, P. virgatum, and Pseudogymnoascus pannorum produced high amounts of FA. This suggests that the soils of Antarctica Bay, as well as harbouring known oleaginous fungi, are also an important source of oleaginous filamentous fungi that remain poorly analysed. © 2025 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Arctic soils are constantly subjected to extreme environmental conditions such as low humidity, strong winds, high salinity, freeze-thaw cycles, UV exposition, and low nutrient availability, therefore, they have developed unique microbial ecosystems. These environments provide excellent opportunities to study microbial ecology and evolution within pristine (i.e. with limited anthropogenic influence) regions since the High Arctic is still considered one of the wildest and least explored environments on the planet. This environment is also of interest for the screening and recovery of unique microbial strains suitable for various biotechnological applications. In this study, a combination of culture-depended and culture-independent approaches was used to determine the cultivation bias in studies of the diversity of cold-active microorganisms. Cultivation bias is a reduction in recovered diversity, introduced when applying a classical culturing technique. Six different soil types, collected in the vicinity of the Polish Polar Station Hornsund (Spitsbergen, Norway), were tested. It was revealed that the used media allowed recovery of only 6.37 % of bacterial and 20 % of fungal genera when compared with a culture-independent approach. Moreover, it was shown that a combination of R2A and Marine Broth media recovered as much as 93.6 % of all cultivable bacterial genera detected in this study. Based on these results, a novel protocol for genome-guided bioprospecting, combining a culture-dependent approach, metabarcoding, next-generation sequencing, and genomic data reuse was developed. With this methodology, 14 psychrotolerant, multi-metal-resistant strains, including the highly promising Rhodococcus spp., were obtained. These strains, besides increased metal tolerance, have a petroleum hydrocarbon utilization capacity, and thus may be good candidates for future bioremediation technologies, also suited to permanently cold regions. © 2022 The Authors},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract—: The abundance and diversity of filamentous fungi in the bottom sediments of the Arctic Ocean seas (the Greenland, Barents, and Kara seas) were studied. Samples of the surface bottom sediments were collected during the 84th (July–August 2021) and 86th (October–November 2021) cruises of RV Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. The taxonomic affiliation of the isolated fungi was determined using polyphasic taxonomy. The isolated fungi belonged to 16 genera of different classes of ascomycetous, basidiomycetous, and zygomycetous fungi. The effect of cultivation temperature and different NaCl concentrations on fungal growth was determined, as well as the effect of cultivation conditions on the fatty acid profile for the strains capable of growth on media with increased osmotic potential. While fatty acid composition was shown to be affected by changes in environmental conditions, the response to osmotic stress differed among the studied cultures from deep-sea sediments. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

  ABSTRACT = {Natural pigments have received special attention from the market and industry as they could overcome the harm to health and the environmental issues caused by synthetic pigments. These pigments are commonly extracted from a wide range of organisms, and when added to products they can alter/add new physical–chemical or biological properties to them. Fungi from extreme environments showed to be a promising source in the search for biomolecules with antimicrobial and antiparasitic potential. This study aimed to isolate fungi from Antarctic soils and screen them for pigment production with antimicrobial and antiparasitic potential, together with other previously isolated strains A total of 52 fungi were isolated from soils in front of the Collins Glacier (Southeast border). Also, 106 filamentous fungi previously isolated from the Collins Glacier (West border) were screened for extracellular pigment production. Five strains were able to produce extracellular pigments and were identified by ITS sequencing as Talaromyces cnidii, Pseudogymnoascus shaanxiensis and Pseudogymnoascus sp. All Pseudogymnoascus spp. (SC04.P3, SC3.P3, SC122.P3 and ACF093) extracts were able to inhibit S. aureus ATCC6538 and two (SC12.P3, SC32.P3) presented activity against Leishmania (L.) infantum, Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanossoma cruzii. Extracts compounds characterization by UPLC-ESI-QToF analysis confirmed the presence of molecules with biological activity such as: Asterric acid, Violaceol, Mollicellin, Psegynamide A, Diorcinol, Thailandolide A. In conclusion, this work showed the potential of Antartic fungal strains from Collins Glacier for bioactive molecules production with activity against Gram positive bacteria and parasitic protozoas. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.},

  ABSTRACT = {We studied the culturable fungal community recovered from deep marine sediments in the maritime Antarctic, and assessed their capabilities to produce exoenzymes, emulsifiers and metabolites with phytotoxic activity. Sixty-eight Ascomycota fungal isolates were recovered and identified. The most abundant taxon recovered was the yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii, followed by the filamentous fungi Penicillium chrysogenum, P. cf. palitans, Pseudeurotium cf. bakeri, Thelebolus balaustiformis, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and Cladosporium sp. Diversity indices displayed low values overall, with the highest values obtained at shallow depth, decreasing to the deepest location sampled. Only M. guilliermondii and P. cf. palitans were detected in the sediments at all depths sampled, and were the most abundant taxa at all sample sites. The most abundant enzymes detected were proteases, followed by invertases, cellulases, lipases, carrageenases, agarases, pectinases and esterases. Four isolates showed good biosurfactant activity, particularly the endemic species A. psychrotrophicus. Twenty-four isolates of P. cf. palitans displayed strong phytotoxic activities against the models Lactuca sativa and Allium schoenoprasum. The cultivable fungi recovered demonstrated good biosynthetic activity in the production of hydrolytic exoenzymes, biosurfactant molecules and metabolites with phytotoxic activity, reinforcing the importance of documenting the taxonomic, ecological and biotechnological properties of fungi present in deep oceanic sediments of the Southern Ocean. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

  ABSTRACT = {This study characterized cultivable fungi present in sediments obtained from Boeckella Lake, Hope Bay, in the north-east of the Antarctic Peninsula, and evaluated their production of enzymes and biosurfactants of potential industrial interest. A total of 116 fungal isolates were obtained, which were classified into 16 genera within the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota, in rank. The most abundant genera of filamentous fungi included Pseudogymnoascus, Pseudeurotium and Antarctomyces; for yeasts, Thelebolales and Naganishia taxa were dominant. Overall, the lake sediments exhibited high fungal diversity and moderate richness and dominance. The enzymes esterase, cellulase and protease were the most abundantly produced by these fungi. Ramgea cf. ozimecii, Holtermanniella wattica, Leucosporidium creatinivorum, Leucosporidium sp., Mrakia blollopis, Naganishia sp. and Phenoliferia sp. displayed enzymatic index > 2. Fourteen isolates of filamentous fungi demonstrated an Emulsification Index 24% (EI24%) ≥ 50%; among them, three isolates of A. psychrotrophicus showed an EI24% > 80%. Boeckella Lake itself is in the process of drying out due to the impact of regional climate change, and may be lost completely in approaching decades, therefore hosts a threatened community of cultivable fungi that produce important biomolecules with potential application in biotechnological processes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK 2024.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctic soils are unique from those found nearly anywhere else on Earth yet can still harbor a broad diversity of microorganisms able to tolerate the challenging conditions typical of the continent. For these reasons, microbiologists have been drawn to Antarctica for decades. However, our understanding of which microbes thrive in Antarctic soils and how they to do so remains limited. To help resolve these knowledge gaps, we analyzed a collection of 200 archived Antarctic soils—from Livingston Island on the Antarctic Peninsula to Cape Hallett in northern Victoria Land. We analyzed the prokaryotic and fungal communities in these soils using both cultivation-independent marker gene sequencing and cultivation-dependent approaches (microbial isolation), paired with extensive soil geochemical analyses. Our cultivation-independent analyses indicate that colder, saltier, and drier soils harbor less diverse communities of bacteria and fungi, distinct from those found in soils with less challenging conditions. We also built a culture collection from a subset of these soils that encompasses more than 50 bacterial and fungal genera, including cold-tolerant organisms, such as Cryobacterium and Cryomyces. By directly comparing the diversity of our cultured isolates against our cultivation-independent data, we show that many of the more abundant Antarctic taxa are not readily cultivated and highlight bacterial and fungal taxa that should be the focus of future cultivation efforts. Together, we hope that our collection of isolates, the comprehensive data compiled from the cultivation-independent analyses, and our geochemical analyses will serve as a community resource to accelerate the study of Antarctic soil microbes. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  ABSTRACT = {Extreme cold environments like glaciers, present substantial obstacles to the survival of organisms. Cryoconite, dark sediment covering glacier, provide unique niche for microorganisms. Therefore, we focused on understanding the diversity of fungi in Arctic ecosystems (Hansbreen, Spitsbergen), which is important in the analysis of the structure and of fungi populations. Due to a combination of two incubation temperatures (7°C or 24°C) and two media during isolation (potato dextrose agar, PDA or yeast extract peptone glucose, YPG), and classical/molecular identification approaches, we identified 20 different fungi (17 species and three unassigned species). Most belonged to filamentous fungi within the Ascomycota (19 isolates), with one identified as Basidiomycota-yeast. Regarding growth conditions, both media yielded greater number of fungal cultures at 24°C compared to 7°C. Additionally, PDA was more effective than YPG in isolating fungal cultures. On the other hand, the optimal temperature for achieving the highest CFU (colony–forming unit)/g of sediment was 7°C. The most frequently isolated species was Cladosporium cladosporioides, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to detect, the following species in an Arctic environment: Aspergillus jensenii, A. tennesseensis, Peziza varia, and Trichoderma paraviridescens. Additionally, there was a visible increase in the number of fungal propagules but a decrease in their biodiversity towards the upper parts of the glacier. Considering the Arctic amplification there is a need for further research on diversity and function of fungi in glacial ecosystems. © 2024 Polska Akademia Nauk. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Despite low temperatures, poor nutrient levels and high pressure, microorganisms thrive in deep-sea environments of polar regions. The adaptability to such extreme environments renders deep-sea microorganisms an encouraging source of novel, bioactive secondary metabolites. In this study, we isolated 77 microorganisms collected by a remotely operated vehicle from the seafloor in the Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean (depth of 2454 m). Thirty-two bacteria and six fungal strains that represented the phylogenetic diversity of the isolates were cultured using an One-Strain-Many-Compounds (OSMAC) approach. The crude EtOAc extracts were tested for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. While antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium was common for many isolates, only two bacteria displayed anticancer activity, and two fungi inhibited the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Due to bioactivity against C. albicans and rich chemical diversity based on molecular network-based untargeted metabolomics, Aspergillus versicolor PS108-62 was selected for an in-depth chemical investigation. A chemical work-up of the SPE-fractions of its dichloromethane subextract led to the isolation of a new PKS-NRPS hybrid macrolactone, versicolide A (1), a new quinazoline (−)-isoversicomide A (3), as well as three known compounds, burnettramic acid A (2), cyclopenol (4) and cyclopenin (5). Their structures were elucidated by a combination of HRMS, NMR, [α]D, FT-IR spectroscopy and computational approaches. Due to the low amounts obtained, only compounds 2 and 4 could be tested for bioactivity, with 2 inhibiting the growth of C. albicans (IC50 7.2 µg/mL). These findings highlight, on the one hand, the vast potential of the genus Aspergillus to produce novel chemistry, particularly from underexplored ecological niches such as the Arctic deep sea, and on the other, the importance of untargeted metabolomics for selection of marine extracts for downstream chemical investigations. © 2023 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Walker Glacier near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic (terrestrial margin of the ‘Last Ice Area’) is undergoing rapid ice attrition in response to climate change. We applied culture and molecular methods to investigate fungal diversity at the terminus of this glacier. Analysis of the mycoflora composition showed that the Walker Glacier isolates sep-arated into two clusters: the surface of the glacier ice and the glacier foreland. The recently exposed sediments of the foreland had a lower fungal diversity and different species from those on the ice, with the exception of five species that occurred in both habitats. This loss of glacial ice in the Arctic is therefore resulting in the loss of habitats for cold-dwelling fungal species. Fungal diversity is a potentially rich biological resource of glacial ecosystems, with unique taxa. The rapid loss of these glacial habitats underscores the urgency for genomic surveys of fungal diversity in the High Arctic, and the need for further isolation of strains as well as cryopreservation of environmental micro-biome samples for future research and conservation. © 2022 by the authors.

  ABSTRACT = {We characterized the diversity, distribution, systematic colonization, and xerophilic capabilities of fungi associated with the Antarctic angiosperms Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica collected at different sites of the South Shetlands Islands, Antarctic Peninsula. A total of 684 fungal isolates were obtained and identified into 67 taxa from 32 genera. The highest fungal diversity and richness were obtained from the rhizosphere, roots, and leaves, in order, and only 11 taxa shared between both plants. Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus were the dominant fungal genera. However, the rarefaction curves for plant fungal assemblages did not reach a plateau, suggesting that these Antarctic plants may host more fungi in their tissues and rhizospheres. A total of 460 isolates grew at water activity (aw) = 0.95, 200 at 0.90, 110 at 0.81, and 47 at 0.66. Antarctomyces, Cladosporium, Mortierella, Leptosphaeria, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, and Thelebolus taxa grew at aw = 0.81 and 0.66 and considered highly xerophilic. In addition, specific isolates of Penicillium and Thelebolus exhibited the highest mycelial growth at aw = 0.66. Our results show that the internal tissues and rhizosphere of Antarctic angiosperms host rich and diverse fungal communities dominated by cold-adapted and endemic taxa, which seem to coexist as symbionts and decomposer fungi. In addition, specific fungi are able to colonize different parts of the plant, suggesting a high ecological relationship with their hosts. Finally, different fungi living in the rhizosphere displayed remarkable xerophilic tolerance, representing promising candidates for further biotechnological studies, including identification of genes for applications in industry and agriculture. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {To explore the diversity and application potential of Antarctic microorganisms, 1208 strains bacteria and fungi were isolated from 5 samples collected from the Fildes Peninsula during China’s 27th and 31st Antarctic expeditions. By using 16S and ITS sequence similarity alignment, 83 strains bacteria belonging to 20 genera and 30 strains fungi belonging to 7 genera were identified. Among them, 1 strains bacteria and 6 strains fungi showed low sequence similarity to the database, suggesting that they might be novel species. Physiological-biochemical characteristics showed that the identified bacteria could utilize many kinds of carbohydrates and that the identified fungi could produce several kinds of extracellular enzymes. The fungal strain MS-19, identified as Aspergillus sydowii, possesses the potential to produce antifungal activity agents based on an activity-guided approach. Further isolation yielded four polyketones: versicone A (1), versicone B (2), 4-methyl-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one (3), and (R)-(+)-sydowic acid (4). It should be noted that 1 displayed strong activity against Candida albicans, with an MIC value of 3.91 μg/mL. © Copyright © 2020 Cong, Yin, Deng, Shen, Tian, Wang and Yang.},

  ABSTRACT = {Due to the extensive use of plastics, their quantity in the environment is constantly increasing, which creates a global problem. In the present study, we sought to isolate, test and identify Antarctic microorganisms which possess the ability to biodegrade bioplastics such as poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA) at low temperatures. 161 bacterial and 38 fungal isolates were isolated from 22 Antarctic soil samples. Among them, 92.16% of bacterial and 77.27% of fungal isolates formed a clear zone on emulsified PBSA, 98.04% and 81.82% on PBS and 100% and 77.27% on PCL as an additive to minimal medium at 20 °C. Based on the 16S and 18S rRNA sequences, bacterial strains were identified as species belonging to Pseudomonas and Bacillus and fungal strains as species belonging to Geomyces, Sclerotinia, Fusarium and Mortierella, while the yeast strain was identified as Hansenula anomala. In the biodegradation process conducted under laboratory conditions at 14, 20 and 28 °C, Sclerotinia sp. B11IV and Fusarium sp. B3′M strains showed the highest biodegradation activity at 20 °C (49.68% for PBSA and 33.7% for PCL, 45.99% for PBSA and 49.65% for PCL, respectively). The highest biodegradation rate for Geomyces sp. B10I was noted at 14 °C (25.67% for PBSA and 5.71% for PCL), which suggested a preference for lower temperatures (at 20 °C the biodegradation rate was only 11.34% for PBSA, and 4.46% for PCL). These data showed that microorganisms isolated from Antarctic regions are good candidates for effective plastic degradation at low temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  ABSTRACT = {The fungal complexes of the coal mine spoil tips around the settlement Barentsburg (Svalbard) were studied. Samples were taken from coal mine spoil tips with different ages (formed, 10-years, 30-years and 50-years). Arctic tundra soils were used as the control. The indicators of change were the species composition, diversity level, dominant groups of species and isolate density of fungal communities. The harsh arctic conditions and the inhospitality of the rock substrate determined the relatively low diversity of microfungi. Only 15 species of microfungi were identified in the samples from formed spoil tip, while in the samples from 50-year-old tip the number of microfungi species increased to 29. The average density of microfungi (CFU/g) for all sampling depths of the coal mine spoil tips was low. But this indicator increased with the age of spoil tips. The density of microfungi isolates also increased with depth in the coal mine spoil tips. The composition of the dominant species of microfungi changed with the age of the spoil tips increased. The convergence of the microfungal complexes of spoil tips and control arctic soils indicates gradual increase stability of mycobiota in disturbed areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR},

  ABSTRACT = {Deception Island is a geothermal location in Antarctica that presents active fumaroles, which confers unique characteristics to this habitat. Several studies about microbial communities in Antarctica have been carried out, nevertheless, Antarctic microbiota is still partially unknown. Here we present a multidisciplinary study about sediments obtained by deposition during 4 years in which several approaches have been considered for their characterization. First, a physicochemical characterization, using ionic chromatography and mass spectrometry for the determination of most abundant ions (chloride and sulphate) and elements (mainly silicon), was conducted. In addition, the total microbial community was studied using a metataxonomical approach, revealing a bacterial community dominated by Proteobacteria and Thaumarchaeota as the main archaeal genera and a fungal community mainly composed by Aspergillaceae. Culture-dependent studies showed low microbial diversity, only achieving the isolation of Bacillus-related species, some of them thermophilic, and the isolation of common fungi of Aspergillus or Penicillium spp. Furthermore, diatoms were detected in the sediment and characterized attending to their morphological characteristics using scanning electron microscopy. The study reveals a high influence of the physicochemical conditions in the microbial populations and their distribution, offering valuable data on the interaction between the island and water microbiota. © 2021 by the authors.

  ABSTRACT = {Reported data on the diversity and physiological capabilities of fungi inhabiting ice-free outcrops of continental Antarctica are limited. The present study aimed at investigating the occurrence of fungi on fragments of microbial mats on the lakeshore and lake water and compared it with fungal occurrence on terrestrial moss, using a culture-dependent method. Another purpose was to evaluate the responses of hyphal growth to temperature and the profiles of substrate utilization of fungal isolates under pure culture conditions. A total of 46 fungal isolates were obtained and grouped into eight taxa, with Phoma herbarum being the most frequent taxon, the occurrence of which was closely related to the nitrogen level of the substrata. The colony diameter growth rates of most fungal isolates under pure culture conditions increased linearly with temperature to reach the maximum at 20–25 °C, indicating that these fungi were mesophilic. Moreover, fungal isolates exhibited diversity and redundancy in their utilization of 71 carbon sources, having potentials to utilize an array of substrates including sugars, sugar alcohols, hexose-phosphates, amino acids, hexose acids, and carboxylic acids. © 2021 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR},

  ABSTRACT = {Mycobacteria are ubiquitous microorganisms and may be found in many different environments, either associated or not to diseases. Culture-independent molecular techniques brought new perspectives for research regarding soil microorganisms, which is relevant to microbiologists and industry. Therefore, new research is necessary to broaden our knowledge about ecology and physiology of mycobacteria in extreme environments. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of mycobacteria in Antarctica soil samples and to standardize molecular and culture-dependent techniques to their isolation. Soil DNA was extracted and submitted to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), rrs mycobacterial gene amplification and partial sequencing. Thereby, 10 colonies morphologically similar to mycobacteria were isolated from 10 different samples, resulting in 15 DNA sequences where Mycobacterium neglectum and Mycobacterium kumamotonense were identified, suggesting that Mycobacterium terrae complex representatives are ubiquitous in the region. This study proposes a simple method for mycobacteria cultivation from soil samples and shows that ornithogenic soils can be the source of organic matter and low pH, modulating the mycobacterial Antarctica diversity. Further research aiming to explore mycobacterial diversity in soil are needed to increase knowledge and better explore their evolution, their relation with animal and human species and their potential biotechnological use. © 2022 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR},

  ABSTRACT = {Cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces are a source of cold-adapted microorganisms, but little is known about their fungal inhabitants. Here, we provide the first report of distinctive fungal communities in cryoconite holes in the Werenskiold Glacier on Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, Arctic). Due to a combination of two incubation temperatures (7 °C and 24 ± 0.5 °C) and two media during isolation (PDA, YPG), as well as classical and molecular identification approaches, we were able to identify 23 different fungi (21 species and 2 unassigned species). Most of the fungi cultured from cryoconite sediment were ascomycetous filamentous micromycetes. However, four representatives of macromycetes were also identified (Bjerkandera adusta, Holwaya mucida, Orbiliaceae sp., and Trametes versicolor). Some of the described fungi possess biotechnological potential (Aspergillus pseudoglaucus, A. sydowii, Penicillium expansum, P. velutinum, B. adusta, and T. versicolor), thus, we propose the Arctic region as a source of new strains for industrial applications. In addition, two phytopathogenic representatives were present (P. sumatraense, Botrytis cinerea), as well as one potentially harmful to humans (Cladosporium cladosporioides). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the occurrence of A. pseudoglaucus, C. allicinum, C. ramotenellum, P. sumatraense, P. velutinum, P. cumulodentata, B. adusta, and T. versicolor in polar regions. In all likelihood, two unassigned fungus species (Orbiliaceae and Dothideomycetes spp.) might also be newly described in such environments. Additionally, due to experimenting with 10 sampling sites located at different latitudes, we were able to conclude that the number of fungal spores decreases as one moves down the glacier. Considering the prevalence and endangerment of glacial environments worldwide, such findings suggest their potential as reservoirs of fungal diversity, which should not be overlooked. © 2022 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Little is known about microbial ecosystems of interior Antarctica, if indeed such ecosystems exist. Although considerable research has assessed microorganisms indigenous to coastal regions of Antarctica, particularly their lakes, ponds, and soils, to our knowledge only one characterized bacterium, a strain of Pseudomonas, has been isolated from South Pole ice or snow. Metagenomic community analyses described in this work and elsewhere reveal that a diversity of bacteria exists in inland polar snows, yet attempts to culture and characterize these microbes from this extreme environment have been few to date. In this molecular and culture-dependent investigation of the microbiology of inland Antarctica, we enriched and isolated two new strains of bacteria and one strain of yeast (Fungi) from South Pole snow samples. The bacteria were of the genera Methylobacterium and Sphingomonas, and the yeast grouped with species of Naganishia (class Tremellocytes). In addition to phylogenetic analyses, characterization of these isolates included determinations of cell morphology, growth as a function of temperature, salinity tolerance, and carbon and energy source versatility. All organisms were found to be cold-adapted, and the yeast strain additionally showed considerable halotolerance. These descriptions expand our understanding of the diversity and metabolic activities of snowbound microorganisms of interior Antarctica. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {We assessed the diversity of cultivable fungi in the ornithogenic soil nests of bird species like Phalacrocorax atriceps, Macronectes giganteus, Pygoscelis antarcticus, and Pygoscelis papua in the Antarctic islands. From 481 fungi isolated at 15 °C, only 50 displayed growth at 37 °C, and were identified as 14 species of 15 genera. Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were the most abundant species obtained. Fifty taxa grew at 40 °C; displayed haemolytic and phospholipase activities; produced tiny spores, capsule, and melanin; showed growth at different pH; and showed resistance to amphotericin B. Interestingly, the minimum inhibitory concentration of amphotericin B increased by 5–10 fold for some A. fumigatus isolates after phagocytosis by amoeba. Our results show relations among fungal community compositions present in Antarctic ornithogenic soil and their pathogenic risk to humans in vitro. As the Antarctica Peninsula is a major region of the planet affected by global climate changes, our results, though preliminary, raise concerns about the dispersal of potential pathogenic microbes present in Antarctic substrates by wild birds, which can fly great distances and spread potential pathogens mainly to South America and Oceania. © 2017 British Mycological Society},

  ABSTRACT = {Glacial retreat is one of the most conspicuous signs of warming in Antarctic regions. Glacier soils harbor an active microbial community of decomposers, and under the continuous retraction of glaciers, the soil starts to present a gradient of physical, chemical, and biological factors reflecting regional changes over time. Little is known about the biological nature of fungi in Antarctic glacier soils. In this sense, this work aimed at studying the behavior of fungal community structure from samples of glacier soil collected after glacial retreat (Collins Glacier). A total of 309 fungi distributed in 19 genera were obtained from eleven soil samples. Representatives of the genera Pseudogymnoascus (Ascomycota) and Mortierella (Mortierellomycota) were the most abundant isolates in all samples. The data revealed the presence of filamentous fungi belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota, rarely found in Antarctica. Analysis of the generalized linear models revealed that the distance from the glacier as well as phosphorus and clay were able to modify the distribution of fungal species. Environmental variations proved to have influenced the genera Pseudogymnoascus and Pseudeutorium. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  ABSTRACT = {The major part of the north polar region is intensely rising by postglacial crustal movement. This process gives rise to the separation of different basins from seas and oceans, which affects a combination of freshwater and marine organisms. Gradually losing contact with the seas, many near-shore lakes of the Arctic are mostly desalted and form bogs. Fungi as decomposers play an important role in all ecosystems. However, the diversity and role of fungi in Arctic aquatic ecosystems is largely unknown. It is also not clear how the taxonomic structure of the fungal community is affected by the process of gradual desalinization and waterlogging. We investigated the diversity of filamentous culturable fungi in different parts of the brackish Kislo-Sladkoe Lake (White Sea, Russia). Annually, 42 samples of the bottom and coastal soils have been collected at the lake from which fungi were recovered on standard and selective media. Based on morphological and molecular markers, a total of 127 taxa have been identified. The fungal community appeared to be influenced by its sea origin and comprised both marine (Paradendryphiella salina, Acremonium spp.) and terrestrial soil species of Penicillium, Talaromyces, Mucor, Umbelopsis, Cladosporium, Cadophora, Sistotrema, Helotiales, Pleosporales, sphagnum moss destructors (Oidiodendron spp.) and insect-associated species of Tolypocladium. The results indicate that the composition of the fungal community in the rising polar White Sea region reflects the dynamics of global changes in physical–chemical parameters and animal and plant associations because of separation from the sea. © 2018, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {L-Asparaginase (L-asparagine aminohydrolase, E.C. 3.5.1.1) has been proven to be competent in treating Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL), which is widely observed in paediatric and adult groups. Currently, clinical L-Asparaginase formulations are derived from bacterial sources such as Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. These formulations when administered to ALL patients lead to several immunological and hypersensitive reactions. Hence, additional purification steps are required to remove toxicity induced by the amalgamation of other enzymes like glutaminase and urease. Production of L-Asparaginase that is free of glutaminase and urease is a major area of research. In this paper, we report the screening and isolation of fungal species collected from the soil and mosses in the Schirmacher Hills, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, that produce L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. A total of 55 isolates were obtained from 33 environmental samples that were tested by conventional plate techniques using Phenol red and Bromothymol blue as indicators. Among the isolated fungi, 30 isolates showed L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. The L-Asparaginase producing strain Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1, which showed the highest zone index, was then optimized with a Taguchi design. Optimum enzyme activity of 20.57 U mL−1 was obtained at a temperature of 30 °C and pH of 7.0 after 60 hours. Our work suggests that isolation of fungi from extreme environments such as Antarctica may lead to an important advancement in therapeutic applications with fewer side effects. © 2019, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {We surveyed the diversity of cultivable fungi isolated from cold and hot volcanic soils of Deception Island, Antarctica. Seventy-four fungal isolates were identified; these belonged to 17 taxa in the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, Purpureocillium, and Mortierella. The fungal assemblages showed low diversity, richness, and dominance indices. The Aspergillus taxa were dominant in the soils at 0 °C, 50 °C, and 100 °C. Aspergillus lacticoffeatus, Aspergillus cf. ruber, Penicillium citrinun, and Purpureocillium sodanum were present only in soils having a temperature of 100 °C. Aspergillus calidoustus was present in all thermal soils and displayed the highest densities. The majority of fungi displayed mesophilic behavior; however, different isolates of Aspergillus lacticoffeatus and Aspergillus niger were able to grow at 50 °C; these are phylogenetically close to the causative agents of aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals. Deception Island perhaps represents one of the most visited regions in Antarctica and the tourism there has increased over the last 20 years, especially by elderly tourists, probably with weak immune systems, come in contact with the resident microorganisms, including the thermo-resistant opportunistic Aspergillus species. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {During a research cruise in 2016, we isolated fungi from sediments, seawater, driftwood, fruiting bodies, and macroalgae using three different media to assess species richness and potential bioactivity of cultivable marine fungi in the High Arctic region. Ten stations from the Svalbard archipelago (73–80 °N, 18–31 °E) were investigated and 33 fungal isolates were obtained. These grouped into 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) with acut-off set at 98% similarity. The taxonomic analysis showed that 17 OTUs belonged to Ascomycota, one to Basidiomycota, two to Mucoromycota and two were fungal-like organisms. The nuc rDNA V1-V5 regions of 18S (18S) and D1-D3 regions of 28S (28S) were sequenced from representative isolates of each OTU for comparison to GenBank sequences. Isolates of Lulworthiales and Eurotiales were the most abundant, with seven isolates each. Among the 22 OTUs, nine represent potentially undescribed species based on low similarity to GenBank sequences and 10 isolates showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria in an agar diffusion plug assay. These results show promise for the Arctic region as asource of novel marine fungi with the ability to produce bioactive secondary metabolites with antibacterial properties. © 2019 The Author(s).

  ABSTRACT = {Microbes growing at low temperatures encounter numerous growth constraints. However, fungi that inhabit polar regions can grow and decompose organic compounds at low temperatures. Research on the biodiversity and secretion ability of yeasts from East Ongul Island, and evaluation of their extracellular enzymatic activity at temperatures ranging from −3 to 20 °C, was performed and described in this study. In total, 95 yeast strains were isolated from the surface soil on East Ongul Island, East Antarctica. Based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain sequence similarity, these strains were classified into 10 genera and 16 species. All strains were categorized as basidiomycetous yeasts. One representative strain was selected from each species, and its ability to grow at temperatures between −3 and 37 °C was evaluated. Strain abilities to secrete extracellular enzymes (lipase, cellulase, and protease) at temperatures ranging from −3 to 20 °C were also investigated. Based on the optimal and maximal growth temperatures, the yeasts were classified as psychrophilic or psychrotolerant. All the strains investigated in this study were able to grow at −3 °C and in vitamin-free media. Psychrophilic yeasts, such as Glaciozyma antarctica, Gl. martinii, Mrakia gelida, and Phenoliferia glacialis, did not secrete pronounced amounts of extracellular enzymes at −3 °C; in contrast, the psychrotolerant yeasts Goffeauzyma gilvescens, Holtermanniella wattica, Tausonia pullulans, and Udeniomyces puniceus secreted copious amounts of enzymes, even at subzero temperatures. These results indicated that psychrotolerant yeasts, rather than psychrophilic yeasts, play important roles in the nutrient cycle in the East Ongul Island ecosystem at near-subzero temperatures. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

These samples were used for extracting and cultivation of filamentous fungi on dense nutrient media. Determination of physiological and biochemical characteristics and identification of yeast-like fungi were performed using a microbiological analyser 'Vitek-2' ('Bio Merieux', France). Cultivation of microorganisms was carried out at temperatures from +2 to +37 °C. In results cultures of microscopic fungi of Zygomycota (Mucor circinelloides), Ascomycota (species of the genera cf. Thelebolus, Talaromyces), representatives of the Anamorphic fungi group (Geomyces pannorum, species of the genera Alternaria, Acremonium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium) were isolated from Antarctic samples. Microscopic fungi Penicillium spp. were dominated after the frequency in the studied samples (54.5%). Rhodotorula rubra and Candida sp. among isolated yeast fungi, and dark pigmented fungi represented by Aureobasidium pullulans and Exophiala spp. were identified. The biological properties of a number of isolated fungi (the potential ability to synthesise important biologically active substances: Melanins, carotenoids, lipids) are characterised. Mycobiota of rock communities of Argentine Islands is rich on filamentous and yeast fungi similarly to other regions of Antarctica. A number of fungi investigated are potentially able to synthesise biologically active substances. The dark pigmented species of the genera Cladosporium, Exophiala, Aureobasidium pullulans, capable of melanin synthesis; 'red' yeast Rhodotorula rubra (carotenoid producers and resistant to toxic metals); Mucor circinelloides and Geomyces pannorum, lipid producers, are among these fungi. Yeast-like fungi assimilated a wide range of carbohydrates, which will allow them to be further used for cultivation in laboratory and process conditions. The collection of technologically promising strains of microorganisms, part of the Culture Collection of Fungi at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (Ukraine), is updated with isolated species (strains) of filamentous fungi and yeast-potential producers of biologically active substances, obtained within this study. © 2020 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

  ABSTRACT = {Despite adverse conditions in Antarctica for life, organic materials can be successfully colonized by extremophilic microorganisms. This work describes the isolation of filamentous fungi from terrestrial and maritime habitats of King George Island, Antarctica, and the screening of their ability to produce antimicrobial compounds. A total of 44 samples were collected during the Antarctic expeditions from soil, sediments, terrestrial and marine waters and pieces of wood that had been brought into Antarctica. One hundred thirty-seven psychrotrophic fungi were isolated. Thirty-three strains selected from different samples and with different morphological characteristics were used in molecular identification and antimicrobial activity assays. The ability of all isolations to inhibit growth of different bacteria in vitro was tested using the agar plug diffusion method. Most of the fungi identified were Ascomycota with only a few Zygomycota and no Basidiomycota isolated. Twenty-six cultures corresponded to known species. Penicillium was the most represented genus of identified fungal isolations (24 %) followed by species of Cadophora, Mortierella, Pseudogymnoascus and Neurospora. This is the first report of the presence of Aspergillus pseudodeflectus in this region. Of the isolates under study, eighteen were able to inhibit growth of at least one of the bacterial strains used. © 2018 Verlag Ferdinand Berger und Sohne GmbH. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the Arctic has become a hot spot for microbial research. However, fungal diversity in the Chukchi Sea (adjacent to the Arctic Ocean) is little known. The purpose of this study was to explore fungal diversity in sediments of the Chukchi Sea and the temperature adaptability of the cultured fungi. A total of 74 fungal strains were isolated from nine marine sediment samples collected from the Chukchi Sea. These fungi were identified based on morphological characteristics and sequence comparison of the internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) with the GenBank reference sequence database. Amongst these fungi, 61 strains belonged to the Ascomycota and 13 strains were affiliated with the Basidiomycota. The dominant genus was Penicillium. These fungal strains were cultured at 4°C, 10°C, and 25°C to determine their temperature adaptability. Most strains were able to grow at 4°C, and Thelebolus ellipsoideus was identified as a psychrophilic fungus. Our results revealed a high fungal diversity in marine sediments of the Chukchi Sea and found that some fungal species (Penicillium chrysogenum, Eutypella scoparia, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium tenuissimum, C. perangustums and Thelebolus ellipsoideus) isolated from these sediments were able to grow at 10°C and 4°C. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.},

  ABSTRACT = {We recovered 85 fungal isolates from the acid sulphate soils in chronosequence under para-periglacial conditions in King George Island, Antarctica. Thirty-two taxa belonging to the phylum Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota were identified. Mortierella amoeboidea, Mortierella sp. 2, Mortierella sp. 3, Penicillium sp. 2 and Penicillium sp. 3 dominated the sulphite soils. Despite the multi-extreme physic-chemical conditions of the sulphate soils (low pH, variable content of macro and micronutrients and organic matter), the fungal assemblages exhibited moderate diversity indices, which ranged according to the degree of soil development. Soils with more weathered and, consequently, with highest values of organic carbon shelter the most diverse fungal assemblages, which can be associated with the occurrence of sulphurisation and sulphide oxidation. Different taxa of Mortierella and Penicillium displayed broad pH (3–9) and temperature (5–35 °C) plasticity. The multi-extreme sulphite soils of Antarctica revealed the presence of moderate fungal diversity comprising cold cosmopolitan and psychrophilic endemic taxa. Among these, Mortierella and Penicillium, known to survive in extreme conditions such as low temperature and available organic matter, low pH and high concentrations of metals, might represent interesting techniques to be used in biotechnological processes such as bioleaching in metallurgy and phosphate solubilisation in agriculture. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {Environmental disturbance is an unpreventable consequence of human impact after exploration and research station management in Antarctica. Environmental pollution may directly influence Antarctic mycobiota. However, information about the effect of anthropogenic factors on microscopic fungi at extremely low temperatures is insufficient. This work compared the abundance and the species diversity of mycelial fungi from soils of six Russian research Antarctic stations—Bellingshausen, Progress-2, Druzhnaya-4, Molodezhnaya, Novolazarevskaya and Oasis−affected by various anthropogenic impacts (operation of tracked and wheeled vehicles, storage and use of petroleum products and petroleum leakage sites) with that from their background analogues. New data were obtained on the taxonomic diversity of mycelial fungi from Antarctic soils with different anthropogenic loads. Cultural, morphological and physiological studies of 142 isolated strains of mycelial fungi were supplemented by molecular–biological research into sterile mycelium strains and those with vague morphological characters. This contributed not only to the verification but also to a significant increase in the number of taxa of mycelial fungi isolated from low-temperature ecotopes. Leotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes were found to be the most dominant classes in the studied samples. It was shown that several ecological groups of micromycetes could be isolated among the mycobiota of the investigated habitats, the abundance and species composition of which changed differently under the influence of anthropogenic factors. The current results highlight that microbiota changes in human-affected soils can serve as an indicator of the state of low-temperature ecotopes in general. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {This article presents the results of microscopic fungi complexes in the areas of five Russian polar stations in East Antarctica and the Subantarctic. A total of 104 microfungal species have been identified. Seventyseven fungal species have been detected in samples of soils and anthropogenic materials from polar stations of East Antarctica (Progress, Mirny, Molodezhnaya, and Druzhnaya 4) using mycological methods while, in the Bellingshausen station (Subantarctic), we have isolated 87 micromycete species. The number of fungi in soils varies from individual propagules in control soils to 94000 per 1 g of soil in contaminated areas. The largest number of species is represented by the genus Penicillium (26 species). Fungal species that form the core of mycobiota in most of the studied habitats have been identified. For soils of East Antarctica, it is formed by species of the genera Aureobasidium, Cadophora, Pseudogymnoascus (Geomyces), Thelebolus, and Phoma. Significant differences are established between the mycobiota of East Antarctica and that of the Subantarctic. At the same time, a general trend towards an increase in fungal species diversity and number in the areas of polar stations compared to the control (clean) sites for all studied areas is recorded. These data indicate that a significant part of micromycetes is introduced into the Antarctic by humans (anthropogenic invasion). © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Extreme environments such as the Antarctic can lead to the discovery of new microbial taxa, as well as to new microbial-derived natural products. Considering that little is known yet about the diversity and the genetic resources present in these habitats, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the fungal communities from extreme environments collected at Aldmiralty Bay (Antarctica). A total of 891 and 226 isolates was obtained from soil and marine sediment samples, respectively. The most abundant isolates from soil samples were representatives of the genera Leucosporidium, Pseudogymnoascus, and a non-identified Ascomycota NIA6. Metschnikowia sp. was the most abundant taxon from marine samples, followed by isolates from the genera Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus. Many of the genera were exclusive in marine sediment or terrestrial samples. However, representatives of eight genera were found in both types of samples. Data from non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that each sampling site is unique in their physical-chemical composition and fungal community. Biotechnological potential in relation to enzymatic production at low/moderate temperatures was also investigated. Ligninolytic enzymes were produced by few isolates from root-associated soil. Among the fungi isolated from marine sediments, 16 yeasts and nine fungi showed lipase activity and three yeasts and six filamentous fungi protease activity. The present study permitted increasing our knowledge on the diversity of fungi that inhabit the Antarctic, finding genera that have never been reported in this environment before and discovering putative new species of fungi. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {We accessed the culturable mycobiota present in marine sediments at different depths in Antarctica Ocean. Acremonium fusidioides, Penicillium allii-sativi, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium palitans, Penicillium solitum, and Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus were identified. Penicillium allii-sativi was the dominant species. At least one isolate of each species was capable to present antifungal, trypanocidal, leishmanicidal, antimalarial, nematocidal, or herbicidal activities. Penicillium produced extracts with strong trypanocidal and antimalarial activities, and the extracts of P. solitum and P. chrysogenum demonstrated strong antimalarial activities. Acremonium fusidioides and P. verrucosus displayed strong selective herbicidal properties. The 1H NMR signals for extracts of A. fusidioides, P. chrysogenum, and P. solitum indicated the presence of highly functionalized secondary metabolites, which may be responsible for the biological activities detected. In the deep marine Antarctic sediments, we detected fungal assemblages in which the Penicillium species were found to be dominant and demonstrated capabilities to survive and/or colonise that poly-extreme habitat. Penicillium being a polyextremophile Antarctic species, exhibited strong biological activities and the presence of aromatic compounds in its extracts may indicate that they are wild ancient strains with high genetic and biochemical potentials that enable them to produce bioactive compounds which can be researched in further studies and used in the chemotherapy of neglected tropical diseases as well as in agriculture. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {The presence of fungi in pristine Antarctic soils is of particular interest because of the diversity of this microbial group. However, the extreme conditions that coexist in Antarctica produce a strong selective pressure that could lead to the evolution of novel mechanisms for stress tolerance by indigenous microorganisms. For this reason, in recent years, research on cold-adapted microorganisms has increased, driven by their potential value for applications in biotechnology. Cold-adapted fungi, in particular, have become important sources for the discovery of novel bioactive secondary metabolites and enzymes. In this study, we studied the fungal community structure of 12 soil samples from Antarctic sites, including King George Island (including Collins Glacier), Deception Island and Robert Island. Culturable fungi were isolated and described according to their morphological and phenotypical characteristics, and the richness index was compared with soil chemical properties to describe the fungal community and associated environmental parameters. We isolated 54 fungal strains belonging to the following 19 genera: Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, Lambertella, Cadophora, Candida, Mortierella, Oxygenales, Geomyces, Vishniacozyma, Talaromyces, Rhizopus, Antarctomyces, Cosmospora, Tetracladium, Leptosphaeria, Lecanicillium, Thelebolus, Bjerkandera and an uncultured Zygomycete. The isolated fungi were comprised of 70% Ascomycota, 10% Zygomycota, 10% Basidiomycota, 5% Deuteromycota and 5% Mucoromycota, highlighting that most strains were associated with similar genera grown in cold environments. Among the culturable strains, 55% were psychrotrophic and 45% were psychrophilic, and most were Ascomycetes occurring in their teleomorph forms. Soils from the Collins Glacier showed less species richness and greater species dominance compared with the rest of the sites, whereas samples 4, 7, and 10 (from Fildes Bay, Coppermine Peninsula and Arctowski Station, respectively) showed greater species richness and less species dominance. Species richness was related to the C/N ratio, whereas species dominance was inversely related to C and N content. Thus, the structure of the fungal community was mainly related to soil chemical parameters more than sample location and altitude. © 2019 Durán, Barra, Jorquera, Viscardi, Fernandez, Paz, Mora and Bol.},

  ABSTRACT = {The increasing amount of plastic waste causes significant environmental pollution. In this study, screening of Arctic microorganisms which are able to degrade bioplastics was performed. In total, 313 microorganisms were isolated from 52 soil samples from the Arctic region (Spitsbergen). Among the isolated microorganisms, 121 (38.66%) showed biodegradation activity. The ability of clear zone formation on emulsified poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) was observed for 116 microorganisms (95.87%), on poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) for 73 microorganisms (60.33%), and on poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) for 102 microorganisms (84.3%). Moreover, the growth of microorganisms on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) agar plates was observed for 56 microorganisms (46.28%). Based on the 16S rRNA sequence, 10 bacterial strains which showed the highest ability for biodegradation were identified as species belonging to Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodococcus sp. The isolated fungal strains were tested for polycaprolactone films and commercial corn and potato starch bags degradation under laboratory conditions. Strains 16G (based on the analysis of a partial 18S rRNA sequence, identified as Clonostachys rosea) and 16H (identified as Trichoderma sp.) showed the highest capability for biodegradation. A particularly high capability for biodegradation was observed for the strain Clonostachys rosea, which showed 100% degradation of starch films and 52.91% degradation of PCL films in a 30-day shake flask experiment. The main advantage of the microorganisms isolated from Arctic environment is the ability to grow at low temperature and efficient biodegradation under this condition. The data suggest that C. rosea can be used in natural and laboratory conditions for degradations of bioplastics. © 2017, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {We characterized the diversity of cultivable fungal assemblages associated with the bryospheres of the bipolar mosses Polytrichastrum alpinum and Polytrichastrum juniperinum resident in King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctica. From different parts of the mosses, 160 fungal isolates were obtained and identified using molecular biology methods as 43 taxa of 28 distinct genera. Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Mrakia gelida, Pseudogymnoascus sp., Melanodiplodia sp., and Vishniacozyma victoriae were the dominant taxa and displayed the highest values of frequency. Ecological diversity indices showed that the fungal assemblages were high but ranged among the mosses. Fungi of the bryospheres of both mosses showed different colonization patterns. Only A. psychrotrophicus, M. gelida, Pseudogymnoascus sp., and Leotiomycetidae sp. occurred as endophytes, epiphytes, and in the rhizoidosphere of P. alpinum. In contrast, the bryosphere of P. juniperinum did not show a single common fungus across its different portions. Our results show that the bryosphere of the bipolar Antarctic mosses seem to represent an interesting hostspot of fungal diversity dominated by cosmopolitan cold-adapted and endemic species recognized as symbionts and decomposer species. The high fungal diversity detected suggests that the Antarctic mosses may offer a protected microhabitat (bryosphere) favorable for the survival, dispersal, and colonization of symbionts and decomposer fungi in the different extreme environments of Antarctica. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {The analysis of algal-mycological complexes in Albic Podzolic soils affected by emissions of the Kandalaksha Aluminum Smelter (KAS) was carried out. The number and biomass of microscopic fungi in the maximum fluorine-polluted zone (fluorine-content >1000 mg/kg) more than 2 times lower than in distanced areas and amounted to 17.3 thousants colony-forming units/g and 1.33 mg/g respectively. Altogether, 31 species of soil fungi were isolated. The species Penicillium trzebinskii and P. miczynskii dominated the zone of maximum pollution. P. glabrum, P. spinulosum, and Memnoniella echinata prevailed in the zones of moderate pollution and background. The part of opportunistic fungi in contaminated soil increased in comparison with the background soil. The reduction of dark-colored fungi biomass in contaminated soil was noted. In total, 56 species of eukaryotic algae and 7 species of cyanobacteria were found. Among green algae, the species from families Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae dominated in all plots. In the zones of maximum and strong contamination, 53 algae species were found including xanthophytes, which were absent in unpolluted areas. The number of viable cells in the litter of the maximum contaminated soils varied from 100 thousand to 1.5 million in 1 g of absolutely dry soil. The species composition of algae and cyanobacteria in these soils showed the characteristic features of the Arctic biological soil crusts. © 2020 EMUNI Press.},

  ABSTRACT = {Molecular biology techniques were used to identify 218 fungi from soil samples collected from four islands of Antarctica. These consisted of 22 taxa of 15 different genera belonging to the Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Mortierella, Antarctomyces, Pseudogymnoascus, and Penicillium were the most frequently isolated genera and Penicillium tardochrysogenum, Penicillium verrucosus, Goffeauzyma gilvescens, and Mortierella sp. 2 the most abundant taxa. All fungal isolates were cultivated using solid-state fermentation to obtain their crude extracts. Pseudogymnoascus destructans, Mortierella parvispora, and Penicillium chrysogenum displayed antiparasitic activities, whilst extracts of P. destructans, Mortierella amoeboidea, Mortierella sp. 3, and P. tardochrysogenum showed herbicidal activities. Reported as pathogenic for bats, different isolates of P. destructans exhibited trypanocidal activities and herbicidal activity, and may be a source of bioactive molecules to be considered for chemotherapy against neglected tropical diseases. The abundant presence of P. destructans in soils of the four islands gives evidence supporting that soils in the Antarctic Peninsula constitute a natural source of strains of this genus, including some P. destructans strains that are phylogenetically close to those that infect bats in North America and Europe/Palearctic Asia. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {We recovered 195 fungal isolates from the sediments of different lakes in the Antarctic Peninsula, which were screened to detect bioactive compounds. Forty-two taxa belonging to the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mortierellomycota were identified. Thelebolus globosus, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus, Vishniacozyma victoriae, and Phenoliferia sp. were found to be the most prevalent. The fungal assemblages showed high diversity and richness, but low dominance values. However, the diversity indices and fungal distribution ranged according to the different lake sediments. Sixty fungal extracts displayed at least one biological activity against the evaluated targets. Among them, Pseudogymnoascus destructans showed selective trypanocidal activity, Cladosporium sp. 1 and Trichoderma polysporum showed antifungal activity, and Pseudogymnoascus appendiculatus and Helotiales sp. showed high herbicidal activity. We detected a rich and diverse fungal community composed of cold cosmopolitan and psychrophilic endemic taxa recognized as decomposers, symbiotics, pathogens, and potential new species, in the sediments of Antarctic lakes. The dynamics and balance of this fungal community represents an interesting aquatic web model for further ecological and evolutionary studies under extreme conditions and potential climate changes in the regions. In addition, we detected fungal taxa and isolates able to produce bioactive compounds that may represent the source of prototype molecules for applications in medicine and agriculture. © 2020 British Mycological Society},

  ABSTRACT = {In this study, we accessed culturable fungal assemblages present in the sediments of three lakes potentially impacted anthropogenically in the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica and identified 63 taxa. Cladosporium sp. 2, Pseudeurotium hygrophilum, and Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus were recovered from the sampled sediments of all lakes. High concentrations of metals and the lowest fungal diversity indices were detected in the sediments of the Central Lake, which can be influenced by human activities due to their proximity to research stations to those of the other two lakes, which were far from the Antarctic stations. At least one type of biological activity was demonstrated by 40 fungal extracts. Among these, P. hygrophilum, P. verrucosus, Penicillium glabrum, and Penicillium solitum demonstrated strong trypanocidal, herbicidal, and antifungal activities. Our results suggest that an increase of the anthropogenic activities in the region might have affected the microbial diversity and composition. In addition, the fungal diversity in these lakes may be a useful model to study the effect of anthropogenic activities in Antarctica. We isolated a diverse group of fungal taxa from Antarctic lake sediments, which have the potential to produce novel compounds for the both the medical and agriculture sectors. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {Since the discovery of penicillin, fungi have been an important source of bioactive natural products. However, as a specific resource, the bioactive potentiality and specificity of fungal metabolites from the Antarctic region have had little attention. In this paper, we investigated the diversity patterns and biological activities of cultivable fungi isolated from soil samples in Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. Fungal communities showed low abundance and diversity; a total of 150 cultivable fungi were isolated from eight soil samples. After being dereplicated by morphological characteristics and chemical fingerprints, 47 fungal isolates were identified by ITS-rDNA sequencing. We confirmed that these isolates belonged to at least 11 different genera and clustered into nine groups corresponding to taxonomic orders in the phylogenetic analysis. Using two different fermentation conditions, 94 crude extracts acquired from the abovementioned different metabolite characteristic isolates were screened by bioactivity assay and 18 isolates produced biologically active compounds. Compared with HPLC–DAD–UV fingerprint analysis of culture extracts and standard compounds, two bioactive components secalonic acid and chetracins were identified. Our research suggests that the abundance and diversity of Antarctic cultivable fungal communities exhibit unique ecological characteristics and potential producers of novel natural bioactive products. © 2016, Springer Japan.},

In this study, soil samples were collected from Deception Island, Wilhelmina Bay (north-west Antarctic Peninsula, Graham Land) and Yankee Bay (Greenwich Island), maritime Antarctica, for the isolation of soil fungi and determination of their antimicrobial activity. The soil-plate method, agar block, disc diffusion and broth micro-dilution assays were applied to characterize the thermal classes and antimicrobial activity of the isolated fungi. A total of 27 isolates of fungi were obtained from 14 soil samples, including 13 Ascomycota, 4 Zygomycota and 10 anamorphic fungi. Cold-active (psychrotolerant) fungi predominated over cold-adapted (psychrophilic) fungi. In the antimicrobial assay, 16 isolates showed substantial inhibitory activity against test bacterial pathogens. Ethyl acetate extracts of 10 competent isolates showed significant inhibition of bacterial pathogens. Antifungal activity was observed in the disc diffusion assay, but not in the agar block assay. Minimum inhibitory, bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations were determined using the broth micro-dilution method, with an average in the range of 0.78-25 mg ml-1on the test microorganisms. Isolate WHB-sp. 7 showed the best broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, with the potential for biotechnological studies in antibiotic development.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fungi are known to produce a range of extracellular enzymes and other secondary metabolites. Investment in extracellular enzyme production may be an important element of the survival strategy of these fungi in maritime Antarctic soils. This study focuses on fungi that were isolated from ornithogenic, undisturbed and human-impacted soils collected from the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, during the austral summer in February 2007. We (1) describe fungal diversity based on molecular approaches, (2) describe the thermal characteristics of the fungal isolates, and (3) screen extracellular hydrolase enzyme production (amylase and cellulase) by the isolates. Soil samples were cultured using the Warcup soil plating technique and incubated at 4 and 25 °C to allow basic thermal classification. In total, 101 isolates were obtained. All the isolates were screened at culture temperatures of 4 and 25 °C in order to detect activity of extracellular hydrolase enzymes. At 25 °C, ornithogenic penguin rookery soils recorded the lowest diversity of fungi, with little difference in diversity apparent between the other soils examined. At 4 °C, an undisturbed site recorded the lowest and a human-impacted site the highest diversity of fungi. The majority of the fungi identified in this study were in the mesophilic thermal class. Six strains possessed significant activity for amylase and 13 for cellulase at 25 °C. At 4 °C, four strains showed significant amylase and 22 significant cellulase activity. The data presented increase our understanding of microbial responses to environmental temperature. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctica is a pristine and extreme environment that represents a unique opportunity for taxonomic, ecological and biotechnological studies of the microorganisms. In the present work, the fungal communities of rhizosphere soil of Deschampsia antarctica, soil, ornithogenic soil, marine and lake sediments in the Antarctic Peninsula were characterized as well as their capability to produce bioactive compounds. One hundred fungal isolates were recovered and identified by molecular analysis in 35 different taxa of 20 genera. Pseudogymnoascus sp. 1 and 3, Penicillium sp., Peniophora sp. and Mortierella alpina were the most frequent taxa identified. All isolates were cultured to produce ethanolic extracts, which were assayed against different target organisms to detect antimicrobial (against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis), cytotoxic (against breast MCF-7 and renal TK-10 human tumoral cells) and antiprotozoal (against Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi) activities. Among the three human pathogenic fungal species, 20 extracts showed moderate to high and selective antifungal activity against P. brasiliensis. The extract of Purpureocillium lilacinum displayed high trypanocidal, antifungal and antibacterial activities, but with moderate toxicity over normal cells. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectral analysis indicated the presence of compounds containing a highly functionalized aromatic ring system. Our results suggest that the Antarctic ecosystems represent an interesting habitat for the isolation and characterization of fungal taxa capable to producing bioactive compounds. The fungus P. lilacinum showed strong trypanocidal and antimicrobial activities with moderate toxicity over normal cells, which might be used as scaffold for the development of new drugs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  ABSTRACT = {The distribution of the fungal biomass and diversity of cultivated microscopic fungi in the profiles of some soils from East (Progress Station, valleys of the Larsemann Hills oasis) and West (Russkaya Station, the Marie Byrd Land) Antarctica regions were studied. The structure of the biomass (spore/mycelium and live cells/dead cells) was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with staining using a set of coloring agents: calcofluor white, ethidium bromide, and fluorescein diacetate. The species composition of the cultivated microscopic fungi was determined on Czapek’s medium. The fungal biomass in the soils studied is not high (on the average, 0.3 mg/g of soil); the greatest biomass (0.6 mg/g) was found in the soil samples with plant residues. The fungal biomass is mainly (to 70%) represented by small (to 2.5 μm) spores. About half of the fungal biomass is composed of living cells. There are differences in the distribution of the fungal biomass within the profiles of different primitive soils. In the soil samples taken under mosses and lichens, the maximal biomass was registered in the top soil horizons. In the soils with the peat horizon under stone pavements, the greatest fungal biomass was registered in the subsurface horizons. Thirty-eight species of cultivated microscopic fungi were isolated from the soils studied. Species of the genus Penicillium and Phoma herbarum predominated. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Browning Peninsula is an ice-free polar desert situated in the Windmill Islands, Eastern Antarctica. The entire site is described as a barren landscape, comprised of frost boils with soils dominated by microbial life. In this study, we explored the microbial diversity and edaphic drivers of community structure across this site using traditional cultivation methods, a novel approach the soil substrate membrane system (SSMS), and culture-independent 454-tag pyrosequencing. The measured soil environmental and microphysical factors of chlorine, phosphate, aspect and elevation were found to be significant drivers of the bacterial community, while none of the soil parameters analyzed were significantly correlated to the fungal community. Overall, Browning Peninsula soil harbored a distinctive microbial community in comparison to other Antarctic soils comprised of a unique bacterial diversity and extremely limited fungal diversity. Tag pyrosequencing data revealed the bacterial community to be dominated by Actinobacteria (36%), followed by Chloroflexi (18%), Cyanobacteria (14%), and Proteobacteria (10%). For fungi, Ascomycota (97%) dominated the soil microbiome, followed by Basidiomycota. As expected the diversity recovered from culture-based techniques was lower than that detected using tag sequencing. However, in the SSMS enrichments, that mimic the natural conditions for cultivating oligophilic "k-selected" bacteria, a larger proportion of rare bacterial taxa (15%), such as Blastococcus, Devosia, Herbaspirillum, Propionibacterium and Methylocella and fungal (11%) taxa, such as Nigrospora, Exophiala, Hortaea, and Penidiella were recovered at the genus level. At phylum level, a comparison of OTU's showed that the SSMS shared 21% of Acidobacteria, 11% of Actinobacteria and 10% of Proteobacteria OTU's with soil. For fungi, the shared OTUs was 4% (Basidiomycota) and < 0.5% (Ascomycota). This was the first known attempt to culture microfungi using the SSMS which resulted in an increase in diversity from 14 to 57 microfungi OTUs compared to standard cultivation. Furthermore, the SSMS offers the opportunity to retrieve a greater diversity of bacterial and fungal taxa for future exploitation. © 2017 Pudasaini, Wilson, Ji, van Dorst, Snape, Palmer, Burns and Ferrari.},

  ABSTRACT = {We surveyed the diversity and capability of producing bioactive compounds from a cultivable fungal community isolated from oligotrophic soil of continental Antarctica. A total of 115 fungal isolates were obtained and identified in 11 taxa of Aspergillus, Debaryomyces, Cladosporium, Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium and Hypocreales. The fungal community showed low diversity and richness, and high dominance indices. The extracts of Aspergillus sydowii, Penicillium allii-sativi, Penicillium brevicompactum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium rubens possess antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antitumoral, herbicidal and antiprotozoal activities. Bioactive extracts were examined using 1H NMR spectroscopy and detected the presence of secondary metabolites with chemical shifts. Our results show that the fungi present in cold-oligotrophic soil from Antarctica included few dominant species, which may have important implications for understanding eukaryotic survival in cold-arid oligotrophic soils. We hypothesize that detailed further investigations may provide a greater understanding of the evolution of Antarctic fungi and their relationships with other organisms described in that region. Additionally, different wild pristine bioactive fungal isolates found in continental Antarctic soil may represent a unique source to discover prototype molecules for use in drug and biopesticide discovery studies. © 2015, Springer Japan.},

  ABSTRACT = {Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are distributed worldwide in all semiarid and arid lands, where they play a determinant role in element cycling and soil development. Although much work has concentrated on BSC microbial communities, free-living fungi have been hitherto largely overlooked. The aim of this study was to examine the fungal biodiversity, by cultural-dependent and cultural-independent approaches, in thirteen samples of Arctic BSCs collected at different sites in the Alpine Tarfala Valley, located on the slopes of Kebnekaise, the highest mountain in northern Scandinavia. Isolated fungi were identified by both microscopic observation and molecular approaches. Data revealed that the fungal assemblage composition was homogeneous among the BSCs analyzed, with low biodiversity and the presence of a few dominant species; the majority of fungi isolated belonged to the Ascomycota, and Cryptococcus gilvescens and Pezoloma ericae were the most frequently-recorded species. Ecological considerations for the species involved and the implication of our findings for future fungal research in BSCs are put forward. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  ABSTRACT = {The mycobiota of bottom sediments at depths of 128−472 m was investigated in Barents and Kara sea areas remote from the shore. The species composition and fungal abundance, that is, the number of fungal colony-forming units (CFUs), were determined in 5 samples from the Kara Sea and in 14 samples of the Barents Sea. For the first time for the Arctic seas, the fungal biomass was determined in 12 samples of the bottom sediments from the Barents Sea. It was found that fungal abundance in the bottom sediments of the both seas did not exceed 13 CFUs per 1 g of dry substrate weight. In total, only 58 colonies of filamentous fungi belonging to 22 morphotypes, 8 of which were sterile, were isolated from all the samples. No more than six morphotypes were contained in 1 g of dried substrate; they were mostly species of the genus Cladosporium and sterile isolates. The study of the fungal biomass detected both spores and fungal mycelium in the bottom sediments. The total biomass was extremely low and ranged from 0.1 to 0.620 mg/g of the studied substrate. Small spores (with a diameter less than 3 μm) absolutely predominated (from 88 to 99.7% of the biomass). © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica present extreme environmental challenges. Life is restricted to patchy occurrence of lichens, mosses and invertebrates, plus soil microbial communities. Fungi have been described in lichen symbioses but relatively little is known about the occurrence of free-living soil fungi in the Dry Valleys. A challenge in estimating fungal species richness has been the extent to which estimates based on either cultivation or environmental DNA reflect the active assemblage in cold-arid soils. Here, we describe analysis for inland Dry Valleys soil of environmental DNA and RNA (cDNA) to infer total and putative metabolically active assemblages, respectively, plus cultivation approaches using a variety of laboratory growth conditions. Environmental sequences indicated a highly restricted assemblage of just seven phylotypes that affiliated phylogenetically within two known genera, Helicodendron and Zalerion, plus previously unidentified fungal phylotypes. None of the commonly encountered molds and mitosporic genera recorded from maritime Antarctic locations were encountered. A striking difference was observed in the frequency of recovery for phylotypes between libraries. This suggests that both species richness and beta diversity estimates based on DNA libraries have the potential to misinform putatively active assemblages. Cultivation yielded a cold-tolerant Zalerion strain that affiliated with DNA and RNA library clones, and a psychrotrophic yeast (Debaryomyces hansenii), which was not detected using either culture-independent approach. © 2011 The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Various microbial groups are well known to produce a range of extracellular enzymes and other secondary metabolites. However, the occurrence and importance of investment in such activities have received relatively limited attention in studies of Antarctic soil microbiota. In order to examine extracellular enzyme production in this chronically low-temperature environment, fungi were isolated from ornithogenic, pristine and human-impacted soils collected from the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica during the austral summer in February 2007. Twenty-eight isolates of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant fungi were obtained and screened at a culture temperature of 4°C for activity of extracellular hydrolase enzymes (amylase, cellulase, protease), using R2A agar plates supplemented with (a) starch for amylase activity, (b) carboxymethyl cellulose and trypan blue for cellulase activity or (c) skim milk for protease activity. Sixteen isolates showed activity for amylase, 23 for cellulase and 21 for protease. One isolate showed significant activity across all three enzyme types, and a further 10 isolates showed significant activity for at least two of the enzymes. No clear associations were apparent between the fungal taxa isolated and the type of source soil, or in the balance of production of different extracellular enzymes between the different soil habitats sampled. Investment in extracellular enzyme production is clearly an important element of the survival strategy of these fungi in maritime Antarctic soils. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {Endophytic fungi associated with three bryophyte species in the Fildes Region, King George Island, maritime Antarctica, that is, the liverwort Barbilophozia hatcheri, the mosses Chorisodontium aciphyllum and Sanionia uncinata, were studied by culture-dependent method. A total of 128 endophytic fungi were isolated from 1329 tissue segments of 14 samples. The colonization rate of endophytic fungi in three bryophytes species were 12.3%, 12.1%, and 8.7%, respectively. These isolates were identified to 21 taxa, with 15 Ascomycota, 5 Basidiomycota, and 1 unidentified fungus, based on morphological characteristics and sequence analyses of ITS region and D1/D2 domain. The dominant fungal endophyte was Hyaloscyphaceae sp. in B. hatcheri, Rhizoscyphus sp. in C. aciphyllum, and one unidentified fungus in S. uncinata; and their relative frequencies were 33.3%, 32.1%, and 80.0%, respectively. Furthermore, different Shannon-Weiner diversity indices (0.91-1.99) for endophytic fungi and low endophytic fungal composition similarities (0.19-0.40) were found in three bryophyte species. Growth temperature tests indicated that 21 taxa belong to psychrophiles (9), psychrotrophs (11), and mesophile (1). The results herein demonstrate that the Antarctic bryophytes are an interesting source of fungal endophytes and the endophytic fungal composition is different among the bryophyte species, and suggest that these fungal endophytes are adapted to cold stress in Antarctica.

  ABSTRACT = {A total of 71 isolates were collected from lake sediment and soil surrounding lakes in the Skarvsnes area, Antarctica. Based on ITS region sequence similarity, these isolates were classified to 10 genera. Twenty-three isolates were categorized as ascomycetous fungi from five genera (Embellisia, Phoma, Geomyces, Tetracladium or Thelebolus) and 48 isolates were categorized as basidiomycetous fungi in five genera (Mrakia, Cryptococcus, Dioszegia, Rhodotorula or Leucosporidium). Thirty-five percent of culturable fungi were of the genus Mrakia. Eighteen isolates from eight genera were selected and tested for both antifreeze activity and capacity for growth under temperatures ranging from -1 to 25 °C. Rhodotorula sp. NHT-2 possessed a high degree of sequence homology with R. gracialis, while Leucosporidium sp. BSS-1 possessed a high degree of sequence homology with Leu. antarcticum (Glaciozyma antarctica), and these two isolates demonstrated antifreeze activity. All isolates examined were capable of growth at -1 °C. Mrakia spp., while capable of growth at -1 °C, did not demonstrate any antifreeze activity and exhibited only limited secretion of extracellular polysaccharides. Species of the genus Mrakia possessed high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that members of this genus have adapted to cold environments by increasing their membrane fluidity. © 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

  ABSTRACT = {Data are rather lacking on the diversity of microfungi associated with exotic plant substrates transported to continental Antarctica. We examined the diversity and species composition of microfungi associated with withering woody shoots of saplings of Salix spp. (willows) transplanted and in ground contact near Syowa Station, East Antarctica for more than 40 years. The willow saplings originated from Hokkaido, Northern Japan, and were experimentally transplanted in 1967-1968, but died within a few years. Dead willow shoots, unbranched and standing on bare ground for approximately 50 years, were used for the isolation of fungi with the surface disinfection method. A total of 43 isolates were retrieved from 32 (78 %) of the 41 shoots tested. The fungal isolates were classified into 18 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) based on the similarity of rDNA ITS sequences at the 97 % criterion. Leotiomycetes was the most common class in terms of the number of isolates and MOTUs, followed by Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes. Molecular phylogenetic affinities suggested that the closest relatives of the MOTUs were saprobic and root-associated fungi. The result of the present study suggested that Cadophora luteo-olivacea is widespread in soils throughout Antarctica and likely indigenous. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  ABSTRACT = {Polar willow (Salix polaris Wahlenb.), a mycorrhizal dwarf shrub, colonizes recently deglaciated areas in the High Arctic, Svalbard. To clarify successional changes in ECM fungi associated with S. polaris after glacier retreat, we examined the diversity and density of ECM fungi in culture and field conditions. Plant and soil samples were collected from three sites of different successional stages in the deglaciated area of Austre Brøggerbreen, near Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. The successional stages were early stage with newly exposed bare ground (site I), transient stage with scattered colonization of Salix (sites IIa and IIb), and late stage with well-developed vegetation (site III). No ECM colonization on Salix was observed in soils collected from bare ground in early and transient stages (sites I and IIa). However, most Salix individuals showed ECM colonization in soils collected from sites close to Salix colonies in transient and late stages (sites IIb and III). Based on molecular analyses and operational taxonomic unit (OTU: >95% ITS sequence similarity) delimitations, we identified 15 OTUs/species in eight genera. The dominant OTU/species of ECM fungi identified in the transient and late stages was Geopora sp. 1 and Cenococcum sp. 1, respectively. In the culture experiment, ECM diversity was greater in late stage (eight OTUs/species) than in transient stage (three OTUs/species). This pattern was consistent with field observations, i. e., late-stage sites contained more OTUs/species of ECM fungi. These results indicate that species diversity of ECM fungi increases and the dominant species changes with the progress of succession after glacier retreat in the High Arctic. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {Diversity of microorganisms plays an important role in the functioning of ecosystems and their response to large-scale environmental changes. Microbial soil communities from virgin Haswell Island, Antarctica, were studied using the serial dilution-spread plate method at two different temperatures. Microorganisms were identified by sporulation, morphological, chemotaxonomic assessment. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and microalgae prevailed in the samples. Representatives of Chamaesiphon, Dermocarpa, Fischerella, Oscillatoria, Prochlrococcus, Synechococcus, Chlorophyta were detected. Fungal assemblages comprised Aspergillus nidulans, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Alternaria alternata, Mortierella ramanniana, Penicillium verrucosum, Scopulariopsis fusca, Cladophialophora minutissima, Chaetomium gracile, Phoma herbarum,Phialophora fastigiata,Ulocladium consortiale and Candida sp. Actinomycetes were identified by morphological and chemotaxonomic assessment of cell-wall aminoacids and sugars as Streptomyces, Nocardia and Geodermatophilus. Some of the isolated microorganisms formed extracellular enzymes, others biosynthesized substances with antifungal and antibacterial activities. Single psychrotrophic strains have an ability to grow on n-paraffins and naphthalene, and thin-layer chromatographic analyses showed that they synthesized glycolipids. Assays for sugar moiety revealed that they contained different pentoses such as arabinose, xylose or deoxyhexose as rhamnose. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {Cryoconite holes have biogeochemical, ecological and biotechnological importance. This communication presents results on culturable psychrophilic yeast and filamentous fungi from cryoconite holes at Midre Lovénbreen glacier. The identification of these microbes was achieved through conventional and DNA sequencing techniques. Effect of temperature, salt and media on growth of the cultures was studied. Measurements on the bioavailability of nutrients and trace metals were made through different methods including ICPMS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry). Colony forming unit (CFU) per gram of sediment sample was calculated to be about 7 × 10 3-1.4 × 10 4 and 4 × 10 3-1.2 × 10 4 of yeast and filamentous fungi, respectively. Based on morphology and sequence data, these were identified as Cryptococcus gilvescens, Mrakia sp., Rhodotorula sp., Phialophora alba and Articulospora tetracladia. Amongst these, Phialophora alba, Cryptococcus gilvescens and Mrakia sp. zhenx-1 are reported for the first time from Svalbard Arctic, while Rhodotorula sp. (95% gene similarity) is a new species, yet to be described. Rhodotorula sp. expressed high amylase, while Cryptococcus gilvescens showed high lipase activity. Mrakia sp. showed phosphate solubilization between 4 and 15°C, which is a first record. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in substantial amounts in the sediments. Filamentous fungi and yeast in the cryoconite holes drive the process of organic macromolecule degradation through cold-adapted enzyme secretion, thereby assisting in nutrient cycling in these subglacial environments. Further, these cold-adapted enzymes may provide an opportunity for the prospect of biotechnology in Arctic. This is the first report on mycological investigation into cryoconite holes from Midre Lovénbreen glacier. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {This review summarizes research concerning Antarctic fungi at the century-old historic huts of the Heroic Period of exploration in the Ross Dependency 1898-1917 and fungi in pristine terrestrial locations. The motivation of the research was initially to identify potential fungal causes of degradation of the historic huts and artifacts. The research was extended to study fungal presence at pristine sites for comparison purposes and to consider the role of fungi in the respective ecosystems. We employed classical microbiology for isolation of viable organisms, and culture-independent DNA analyses. The research provided baseline data on microbial biodiversity. Principal findings were that there is significant overlap of the yeasts and filamentous fungi isolated from the historic sites, soil, and historic-introduced materials (i. e., wood, foodstuffs) and isolated from environmental samples in pristine locations. Aerial spore monitoring confirmed that winter spore counts were high and, in some cases, similar to those found in summer. Microbial diversity varied between the three Ross Island historic sites, and one historic site showed noticeably higher diversity, which led to the conclusion that this is a variable that should not be generalized. Cultured fungi were cold active, and the broader scientific significance of this finding was that climate change (warming) may not adversely affect these fungal species unless they were out-competed by new arrivals or unfavorable changes in ecosystem domination occur. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fungal abundance and diversity were studied from 245 soil samples collected in 18 distinct ice-free locations in Antarctica including areas in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Ross Sea Region, and the Antarctic Peninsula. Cultivable fungal abundance in soil was found to be most positively correlated with percent carbon and nitrogen based on a Spearman's rank correlation test of six soil parameters. Soil moisture and C/N ratio were also positively correlated with fungal abundance while pH and conductivity were negatively correlated. These results suggest that nutrient limitations in these highly oligotrophic environments are a primary factor in determining the distribution and abundance of indigenous fungi. Other effects of the extreme Antarctic environment likely affect fungi indirectly by limiting the distribution and abundance of plant-derived sources of carbon. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctic environments can sustain a great diversity of well-adapted microorganisms known as psychrophiles or psychrotrophs. The potential of these microorganisms as a resource of enzymes able to maintain their activity and stability at low temperature for technological applications has stimulated interest in exploration and isolation of microbes from this extreme environment. Enzymes produced by these organisms have a considerable potential for technological applications because they are known to have higher enzymatic activities at lower temperatures than their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts. A total of 518 Antarctic microorganisms, were isolated during Antarctic expeditions organized by the Instituto Antártico Uruguayo. Samples of particules suspended in air, ice, sea and freshwater, soil, sediment, bird and marine animal faeces, dead animals, algae, plants, rocks and microbial mats were collected from different sites in maritime Antarctica. We report enzymatic activities present in 161 microorganisms (120 bacteria, 31 yeasts and 10 filamentous fungi) isolated from these locations. Enzymatic performance was evaluated at 4 and 20°C. Most of yeasts and bacteria grew better at 20°C than at 4°C, however the opposite was observed with the fungi. Amylase, lipase and protease activities were frequently found in bacterial strains. Yeasts and fungal isolates typically exhibited lipase, celullase and gelatinase activities. Bacterial isolates with highest enzymatic activities were identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as Pseudomonas spp., Psychrobacter sp., Arthrobacter spp., Bacillus sp. and Carnobacterium sp. Yeasts and fungal strains, with multiple enzymatic activities, belonged to Cryptococcus victoriae, Trichosporon pullulans and Geomyces pannorum. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  ABSTRACT = {From 18 soil samples taken in the vicinity of the permanent Bulgarian Antarctic base "St. Kliment Ohridski" (62°38′29″S, 60°21′53″W) on Livingston Island, 109 filamentous fungi were isolated on selective media. The most widespread fungal species were members of the genera Cladosporium, Geomyces, Penicillium and Aspergillus. Other species, already recorded in Antarctic environment, were also isolated: Lecanicillium muscarium, Epicoccum nigrum and Alternaria alternata. Thirty strains demonstrating good growth were screened for antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) that play an important role in the defense of aerobic organisms against oxidative stress, by converting reactive oxygen species into nontoxic molecules. Six of them showed high enzyme activity. The tested strains produced SOD with statistically significant higher activity at 15°C than at 30°C suggesting that this enzyme is cold-active. Such SOD could be useful in medicine and cosmetics. The best producer of cold-active SOD, Aspergillus glaucus 363, cultivated in bioreactors, demonstrated optimal growth temperature at 25°C and maximum enzyme activities at 25 and 30°C for SOD and CAT, respectively. The electrophoretical analysis showed that the fungus possesses Cu/Zn-SOD. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {Novel cultivation strategies for bacteria are widespread and well described for recovering greater diversity from the "hitherto" unculturable majority. While similar approaches have not yet been demonstrated for fungi it has been suggested that of the 1.5 million estimated species less than 5% have been recovered into pure culture. Fungi are known to be involved in many degradative processes, including the breakdown of petroleum hydrocarbons, and it has been speculated that in Polar Regions they contribute significantly to bioremediation of contaminated soils. Given the biotechnological potential of fungi there is a need to increase efforts for greater species recovery, particularly from extreme environments such as sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. In this study, like the yet-to-be cultured bacteria, high concentrations of nutrients selected for predominantly different fungal species to that recovered using a low nutrient media. By combining both media approaches to the cultivation of fungi from contaminated and non-contaminated soils, 91 fungal species were recovered, including 63 unidentified species. A preliminary biodegradation activity assay on a selection of isolates found that a high proportion of novel and described fungal species from a range of soil samples were capable of hydrocarbon degradation and should be characterized further.© 2011 Ferrari, Zhang and van Dorst.},

To the best of our knowledge, species such as Botrytis verrucosa, Mortierella simplex, M. schmuckeri, Penicillium frequentans, P. rugulosum and Cladosporium chlorocephalum are new records to the study region. All isolates were tested for production of cold-adapted amylase, pectinase, cellulase, esterase, protease, phosphatase and urease. The cultures showed varying degrees of enzyme production, with two cultures producing all seven enzymes.

  ABSTRACT = {Evaporitic deposits are a globally widespread habitat for micro-organisms. The microbe-mineral environment in weathered and remobilized gypsum from exposed mid-Ordovician marine evaporite beds in the polar desert of Devon Island, Nunavut, Canadian High Arctic was examined. The gypsum is characterized by internal green zones of cyanobacterial colonization (dominated by Gloeocapsa/Aphanothece and Chroococcidiopsis spp. morphotypes) and abundant black zones, visible from the surface, that contain pigmented cyanobacteria and fungi. Bioessential elements in the gypsum are primarily provided by allochthonous material from the present-day polar desert. The disruption, uplift and rotation of the evaporite beds by the Haughton meteorite impact 39 Ma have facilitated gypsum weathering and its accessibility as a habitat. No cultured cyanobacteria, bacteria and fungi were halophilic consistent with the expectation that halophily is not required to persist in gypsum habitats. Heterotrophic bacteria from the evaporite were slightly or moderately halotolerant, as were heterotrophs isolated from soil near the gypsum outcrop showing that halotolerance is common in arctic bacteria in this location. Psychrotolerant Arthrobacter species were isolated. No psychrophilic organisms were isolated. Two Arthrobacter isolates from the evaporite were used to mediate gypsum neogenesis in the laboratory, demonstrating a potential role for microbial biomineralization processes in polar environments. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Distribution, species composition and possibilities of germination of the propagule bank of moss in Antarctic soils were investigated by cultural experiments. Soil samples were collected in the Yukidori Valley. Antarctica, and were incubated under laboratory conditions. After several weeks, fungi, algae and mosses were observed in the samples. The dominant species within the germinated moss shoots was Bryum pseudotriquetrum s.lat.; in fact, this species was the only moss species at the study site. Shoots of Ceratodon purpureus and Pottia heimii appeared rarely in the general area, but were not observed at all at the study site. Vegetative propagules such as fragments of shoots were frequently found in the soils, most of the germinated shoots sprouted from such propagules. These propagules were thought to be important for colonization at the site. A relatively large number of shoots of B. pseudotriquetrum appeared from the samples collected from the ground near the vegetation. Most of the propagules of B. pseudotriquetrum in the soils were thought to be dispersed from nearly communities, whereas some propagules such as C. purpureus and P. heimii were thought to be dispersed from more distant moss communities.},

  ABSTRACT = {The diversity and phylogenetic relationships of fungi obtained from Antarctic soils were analysed using molecular techniques. Direct extraction of soil community DNA from two locations, Fossil Bluff (FB) and Jane Col (JC), was supplemented with isolation studies. Nucleic acids from both the community DNA and the colony extracts were PCR amplified using primers specific for the 18S rRNA gene (18S rDNA). Amplicons were separated in denaturant gels (DGGE) or following endonuclease digestion (ARDRA). Clones presenting unique ARDRA banding patterns and unique DGGE bands were sequenced. Comparison of the experimental sequences from the different techniques employed with those held online resulted in the repeated recovery of a limited range of related organisms indicating low species diversity of microfungi in these soils. A total of 102 fungal sequences were obtained from FB (37 sequences) and JC (65 sequences) that together were distributed among the Basidiomycota (48 sequences), Ascomycota (48 sequences) and Zygomycota (6 sequences). Sequences of the latter were only recovered from the JC soils. Phylogenetic comparisons of the experimental sequences with those held online have shown high rRNA gene relatedness with those obtained from other, less extreme, environments. © 2005 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {Saprotrophic filamentous microfungi were isolated by means of the soil dilution method from soil samples collected from four locations in the Bellsund region of Spitsbergen (77°33′N, 14°31′E) representing the following forms of surface micro-relief: an old stormbank, a sorted circle, a frost fissure between tundra polygons, and the central part of a tundra polygon. The fungal isolates were identified and screened for their ability to grow at low temperatures. The oligotrophy of psychrophilic and psychrotrophic strains was then determined as the ability of growth on silica gel without a C source added. Differences in some physico-chemical properties were found between the soils sampled from the four sites. A total of 89 taxa from 17 genera were isolated. Most of the isolates were species of Mortierella, Penicillium, Chrysosporium and Phialophora, and half of them were psychrophiles. Fungal communities isolated from a frost fissure between tundra polygons (site 3) and from the central part of a tundra polygon (site 4) were dominated by psychrophiles but those isolated from an old stormbank (site 1) and a sorted circle (site 2) were predominantly psychrotrophic. Oligopsychrophilic taxa accounted for 27% and oligopsychrotrophic for 20% of all the isolated taxa but only from 0.7% to 11.7% and from 1.2% to 6.3% of the total number of cfu (colony forming unit) isolated from an individual site, respectively. The results of the present study suggest that the abundance of fungi in Arctic soil is mostly affected by the content of organic matter in the A horizon and the plant cover, but other factors, such as the stage of soil development and the micro-relief of the surface, are more important for species richness of fungal communities.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microorganisms play a dominant role in Antarctic ecosystems, yet little is known about how fungal diversity differs at sites with considerable human activity as compared to those that are remote and relatively pristine. Ross Island, Antarctica is the site of three historic expedition huts left by early explorers to the South Pole, Robert F. Scott and Ernest Shackleton. The fungal diversity of these wooden structures and surrounding soils was investigated with traditional culturing methods as well as with molecular methodology including denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA for identification. From historic wood and artifact samples and soils adjacent to the huts as well as soil samples obtained from the Lake Fryxell Basin, a remote Dry Valley location, and remote sites at Mt. Fleming and the Allan Hills, 71 fungal taxa were identified. The historic huts and associated artifacts have been colonized and degraded by fungi to various extents. The most frequently isolated fungal genera from the historic woods sampled include Cadophora, Cladosporium and Geomyces. Similar genera were found in soil samples collected near the huts. Sampling of soils from locations in the Transantarctic Mountains and Lake Fryxell Basin at considerable distances from the huts and with different soil conditions revealed Cryptococcus spp., Epicoccum nigrum and Cladosporium cladosporioides as the most common fungi present and Cadophora species less commonly isolated. DGGE revealed 28 taxa not detected by culturing including four taxa which possibly have not been previously described since they have less than 50% ITS sequence identity to any GenBank accessions. Fungi capable of causing degradation in the wood and artifacts associated with the expedition huts appear to be similar to those present in Antarctic soils, both near and at more remote locations. These species of fungi are likely indigenous to Antarctica and were apparently greatly influenced by the introduction of organic matter brought by early explorers. Considerable degradation has occurred in the wood and other materials by these fungi. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Unicellular fungi, commonly referred to as yeasts, were found to be components of the culturable soil fungal population in Taylor Valley, Mt. Discovery, Wright Valley, and two mountain peaks of South Victoria Land, Antarctica. Samples were taken from sites spanning a diversity of soil habitats that were not directly associated with vertebrate activity. A large proportion of yeasts isolated in this study were basidiomycetous species (89%), of which 43% may represent undescribed species, demonstrating that culturable yeasts remain incompletely described in these polar desert soils. Cryptococcus species represented the most often isolated genus (33%) followed by Leucosporidium (22%). Principle component analysis and multiple linear regression using stepwise selection was used to model the relation between abiotic variables (principle component 1 and principle component 2 scores) and yeast biodiversity (the number of species present at a given site). These analyses identified soil pH and electrical conductivity as significant predictors of yeast biodiversity. Species-specific PCR primers were designed to rapidly discriminate among the Dioszegia and Leucosporidium species collected in this study. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  ABSTRACT = {In a high Arctic polar semidesert ecosystem (ambient N deposition c. 0.1 g N m-2 a-1), the effects of N enrichment on the diversity of soil microfungi and on N content and availability in organic and mineral soils were determined. Three N (total: 0, 0.5, 5gN m-2 a-1) and two P (total 0, 1 g m-2 a-1) treatments were applied, since P may limit response to N in this ecosystem. Organic and mineral soils were sampled in June and August in the second year of treatment for microfungi, pH, moisture content, and total N and P. In the third year, soils were resampled for extractable and total N and P. The fungi isolated were typical of high pH soils in the High Arctic and Antarctic. The species richness and diversity of soil microfungi were very low, with ranges as follows: Shannon diversity, 0.56-1.5; richness, 2-6; evenness, 0.79-0.9. There was no significant effect of treatment on the frequency of occurrence of different taxa of soil microfungi. Time of sampling also had no significant impact on fungal assemblages, although different, more diverse communities were isolated from organic, rather than mineral, soils. Nitrate-N in organic soil decreased significantly when P was added alone, but not when P and N were added together. Addition of 0.5 g N m-2 a-1, a rate deposition already occurring in Greenland and Iceland, appeared to exceed N demand even when P limitation was relieved. There was no apparent soil acidification as a result of the N treatments. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microfungi isolated from soil samples collected in Franz Joseph Land by means of the soil dilution and soil washing methods were screened for their ability to grow at low temperatures. The oligotrophic ability of the psychrotrophic strains was then determined on silica gel. A total of 40 taxa from 21 genera were isolated. Most isolates were species of Acremonium, Geomyces, Mortierella, Phialophora, Phoma, Thelebolus and sterile fungi. Eutypella scoparia, Hyphozyma variabilis and Ovadendron sulphureo-ochraceum are new records as soil and Arctic fungi. Most fungal isolates were psychrotrophic. The few psychrooligotrophs were species of Geomyces, Phoma, Thelebolus and Mortierella. Overall, our results suggest that the major component of an Arctic soil mycoflora should be active in one or more short growing seasons interspersed with periods of prolonged dormancy. Only a minor component, such as the small group of psychrooligotrophic fungi found in this study, may be expected to show continuous slow growth.},

The most frequently isolated fungi from mosses were Mycelia sterilia (47% of total isolates), Phoma spp. (18%), Penicillium spp. (11%), Chrysosporium spp. (7%) and Thelebolus microsporus (6%). Mycelia sterilia, Penicillium spp., Mortierella spp., Chrysosporium cf. pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were also frequently isolated from algae. Fungal distribution and diversity were poor in samples of lichens, compared to samples from mosses and algae. The frequency of occurrence of microfungi was most often associated with strong biotic influence. There was a marked increase in fungal diversity in human-disturbed sites. Twelve taxa were restricted to soils from near the Australian Casey Station, suggesting significant introduction of fungi into this environment by human activities. Away from the station, fungal distribution appeared to be related to substrata and nutrient status rather than dispersal opportunities. Suggestions for future research and the need for constant monitoring to clarify the role of human disturbance on Antarctic fungi are discussed.},

Elevated numbers of culturable hydrocarbon degraders, bacteria and fungi were detected in surface and subsurface soils from oil-contaminated sites, compared with nearby control sites. Culturable yeasts were not detected in soil from coastal control sites, yet reached > 105 organisms g-1 dry weight in contaminated soils. The presence of hydrocarbons in soils resulted in a shift in the genera of culturable filamentous fungi. Chrysosporium dominated control soils, yet Phialophora was more abundant in oil-contaminated soils. Hydrocarbon degraders are most likely bacteria; however, fungi could play a role in degradation of hydrocarbons or their metabolites. Depleted levels of nitrate detected in some contaminated soils and decreased pH may be the result of growth of hydrocarbon degraders. Numbers and diversity of culturable microbes from Antarctic soil varied depending on whether a pristine site or a human-impacted (in this case, by fuel spills) site is studied.},

  ABSTRACT = {Over the last decades, the Antarctic regions have been investigated mainly for the presence and exploitation of psychrophilic bacteria and archea, occasionally for algae and more rarely for fungi. The present study reports results concerning the isolation and identification of filamentous fungi from samples of soil taken from Livingston Island, South Shetland Archipelago, West Antarctica. Using conventional media and techniques, all collection sites yielded populations of filamentous fungi, belonging to the phylum Ascomycota (7 genera), Deuteromycota (2), Zygomycota (2) and Basidiomycota (1). Mucor, Cladosporium, Alternaria, Aspergillus and Penicillium were predominant genera. Lecanicillium, Botrytis, Geomyces, Monodictys and Rhizopus were the most frequently isolated genera. Most of the fungal isolates proved to be cold-tolerant. © 2009 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  ABSTRACT = {The fungal floras of plant communities and mineral soils were determined at locations both close to and away from sites of human activity. Petroleum contaminated soils and discarded wood which occur near Stations were also studied, the former for bacterial as well as fungal colonization. The fungal floras of uncontaminated natural communities comprised relatively few species, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum and Thelebolus microsporus being the most common, together with Epicoccum nigrum at Mawson. P. herbarum dominated the fungal floras of mosses at Mossell Lake but E. nigrum was also common in Mawson mossbeds. G. pannorum was widespread and colonized a range of different habitats, particularly in the Vestfold Hills. T. microsporus was also widespread particularly at sites frequented by birds and seals. Phialophora fastigiata was common around the Stations, especially Davis Station, in soils including those contaminated with oil and in wood, and is thought to have been introduced with softwood packing crates. A greater range of taxa including Mortierella, Mucor, Penicillium and Cladosporium spp. was recorded from Mawson Station than from other sites, and this was attributed to the effects of human activity. Few fungi but a range of bacteria were isolated from the petroleum contaminated soils. A high percentage of these soils contained bacteria which could utilize hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source. Some of these bacteria showed a strong degradative potential, namely Flavobacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp. and an isolate from the family Enterobacteriaceae. One isolate of Corynebacterium and the Enterobacteriaceae isolate were active hydrocarbon degraders at 1°C. Hormoconis resinae, the imperfect state of Amorphotheca resinae was only isolated from oil spill soils and then only from sites of recent spills. Geomyces pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were less common in oil contaminated soils than in uncontaminated soils. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {The growth of fungi isolated from a lowland temperate site (Roudsea Wood National Nature Reserve), an upland temperate moorland (Moor House National Nature Reserve) and an oceanic Antarctic island (Signy, S. Orkneys) was compared at 1, 14 and 25°C. This showed that low temperatures caused greatest retardation of growth in fungi from the warmest site (Roudsea) and least from the coldest site (Signy Island). At Moor House, fungi which were isolated most frequently in winter were able to grow better at 1°C than summer forms. The fungal flora of Signy Island was restricted and consists of cold tolerant cosmopolitan species which have been selected by or become adapted to the prevailing low temperatures. Of fungi isolated from any two of the sites, Mortierella alpina and Mucor hiemalis showed temperature adaptation correlated with prevailing site temperature, while Trichoderma viride, Penicillium thomii, and P. frequentans showed no adaptation. The growth of bacteria isolated from Moor House and Signy Island was also compared at 1,13 and 25°C, and 56 per cent of the Moor House isolates grew best at 25°C compared with 2 per cent of the bacteria from Signy Island. The majority of the latter grew best at 13°C and were Gram-negative rods. © 1971.},

  ABSTRACT = {A microbiological survey of 40 soils from contaminated and pristine localities of Mawson Base or the Vestfold Hills (Davis Base) is described. High microbial populations (from 106 to in excess of 109 cells g-1 dry soil) were associated with soil contaminated by man or animals, soil from beneath a moss bed, or soil from beneath translucent quartz pebbles and containing green algae. Lower microbial populations (generally between 104-106 cells g-1 soil) were associated with pristine soils lacking an identifiable primary producer. No correlation was evident between population density and soil particle size, moisture content, pH or salinity as determined by the electrical conductivity (E.C.) of soil suspensions, although relationships were evident between the components of the microflora and E.C. Microbial groups associated with low E.C. were chitinolytic bacteria, fungi and green algae; favoured by high E.C. were halotolerant bacteria. The microflora of uncontaminated soils appeared to be dominated by Gram-negative aerobic rods (68% of the total flora) with Moraxella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas being the most frequently isolated genera. The remaining microflora comprised Grampositive pleomorphic bacteria (mainly coryneforms), 13%; filamentous Gram-negative aerobic rods (morphologically akin to Bacillus species), 12%; and yeasts, 7%. Streptomyces was identified among the dominant microflora of only one soil. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were never isolated, although their presence was indicated in 40% of the soils tested by acetylene-reduction assay. Anaerobes were not detected in any soil using dilutionplate techniques, but were occasionally detected by enrichment in semi-solid media. All of 242 isolates obtained at 10° incubation were able to grow at 15°, 3.3% failed to grow at 18° and a further 9.5% failed to grow at 25°. Of 304 isolates obtained on one-tenth strength Trypticase-Soy agar (0.05% nutrient concentration), 10% failed to grow on the full-strength medium. Soils from the vicinity of Mawson or Davis bases contained a variety of fungi (Cladosporium, Chrysosporium, Acremonium, Phoma, Aureobasidium and Trichoderma species being isolated) in contrast to pristine soils, from which only Verticillium was occasionally isolated. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {Soil collected from throughout the maritime Antarctic was analyzed to determine the effects of a range of abiotic and biotic soil parameters on the distribution of nematophagous fungi. Endoparasites were far more abundant than predatory fungi due to the greater efficiency of endoparasites in attracting and infecting nematodes, which resulted in a rapid completion of the infection cycle. This allowed endoparasites to colonise even the most exposed soil habitats where conditions favourable for nematode activity were restricted to only a few hours daily. 76% of all endoparasites isolated formed adhesive conidia. The success of this group of endoparasites was due to the ability of the conidia to attract nematodes. Spontaneous trap forming predators were far more abundant than nonspontaneous trap formers. The former have a clear competitive advantage over the latter, as they are able to attract nematodes to the conidia which subsequently germinate and form traps only when induced by direct chemical stimulation of nematodes. These predators are able to use internal reserves only and so rapidly respond to short periods when the soil is unfrozen and the nematodes are active. Although nematodes were utilized by all the species isolated, many were also capable of using Protozoa and Rotifera as a food source. While endoparasites were capable of infecting Rotifera, they were never observed infecting, or were isolated from soil containing, Protozoa. The distribution of endoparasites and spontaneous trap forming predators was largely independent of abiotic soil parameters. They were however significantly associated with the presence and abundance of suitable prey. These species survive solely on nematodes and therefore do not require prolonged periods of suitable soil conditions in order to produce vegetative mycelium to adsorb nutrients saprophytically from the soil, which is a significant ecological advantage over the other groups of microfungi found in the Antarctic. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

  ABSTRACT = {Roots of 76 plant species collected in West Spitsbergen (Svalbard), in the middle-northern Arctic zone, were examined for mycorrhiza and root-associated fungi. Dryas octopetala, Pedicularis dasyantha and Salix polaris were ectomycorrhizal and Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum hermaphroditum ericoid mycorrhizal. Pedicularis dasyantha was only slightly infected. Structures resembling vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi were not found in the roots, and soil samples screened for VAM fungi contained only one spore. Root endophytic fungi commonly occurred in Spits-bergen, but only Olpidium brassicae, Pleospora herbarum, Papulaspora, Microdochium bolleyi and Rhizoctonia solani were identified with reasonable certainty. A sterile endophytic dark-septate fungus (DSF) was in 39.5% of the flowering-plant species examined, especially in the Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Saxifragaceae and Poaceae. DSF were categorized into four slightly overlapping groups. Sterile endophytic hyaline septate fungi were rare. In the literature it is suggested that at least some of the DSF species or the hyaline septate fungi are functionally mutualistic rather than saprophytic or pathogenic. The literature on ectomycorrhizal fungi and plants in Spitsbergen is reviewed, including about 50 species, mainly of the genera Cortinarius, Hebeloma, Inocybe, Laccaria, Lactarius and Russula. These are symbiotic with the above-mentioned ectomycorrhizal plants. Four further ectomycorrhizal plants (Betula nana, Salix spp.) are very rare in the area. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

Trichophyton terrestre was isolated from a site in which people worked and through which penguins and skuas passed. The most widespread fungal species were members of the genus Chrysosporium. Some of these species were isolated but not identified and this part of the study was still be completed. Another significant finding was the absence of fungi in one sample, while in another the widespread and abundant growth in all the seeded dishes of a single species of Chrysosporium. Other species in genera of general diffusion in many environments were also isolated : Aspergillus spp., Malbranchea sp., Mycelia sterilia spp., Paecilomyces sp., Penicillium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

  ABSTRACT = {Results of a study on the diffusion of keratinophilic fungi in an Antarctic environment are given. Nine soil samples collected from as many sites along the coast of Ross Sea, and six dust samples inside the Italian scientific base were examined by direct inoculation and hair baiting methods for soil samples and plate dilution method for dust samples. As regards the variety of species isolated and the counting of the numbers of colonies, plate dilution method proved to be very effective. Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium sp., Dematiaceae, Fusarium sp., Geomyces pannorum v. pannorum, G. pannorum v. vinaceus, Mycelia sterilia, Penicillium spp. were isolated from soil. From the dust the following moulds were isolated:Aphanoascus fulvescens, Aspergillus sp., Beauveria sp., Chrysosporium carmichaelii, Dematiaceae, Geomyces pannorum v. pannorum, G. pannorum v. vinaceus, Malbranchea gypsea, Mycelia sterilia, Nectria inventa, Penicillium spp., Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Scopulariopsis sp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The presence of four colonies of Trichophyton mentagrophytes is emphasized and correlated with the anthropization process. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},
