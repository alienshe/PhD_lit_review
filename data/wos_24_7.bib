Abstract = {The actinobacterial diversity of Arctic marine sediments was
   investigated using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches.
   A total of 152 strains were isolated from seven different media; 18
   isolates were selected for phylogenetic analysis on the basis of their
   16S rRNA gene sequences. Results showed that the 18 isolates belonged to
   a potential novel genus and 10 known genera including Actinotalea,
   Arthrobacter, Brachybacterium, Brevibacterium, Kocuria, Kytococcus,
   Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Mycobacterium, and Pseudonocardia.
   Subsequently, 172 rDNA clones were selected by restriction fragment
   length polymorphism analysis from 692 positive clones within four
   actinobacteria-specific 16S rDNA libraries of Arctic marine sediments,
   and then these 172 clones were sequenced. In total, 67 phylotypes were
   clustered in 11 known genera of actinobacteria including Agrococcus,
   Cellulomonas, Demequina, Iamia, Ilumatobacter, Janibacter, Kocuria,
   Microbacterium, Phycicoccus, Propionibacterium, and Pseudonocardia,
   along with other, unidentified actinobacterial clones. Based on the
   detection of a substantial number of uncultured phylotypes showing low
   BLAST identities (< 95 \%), this study confirms that Arctic marine
   environments harbour highly diverse actinobacterial communities, many of
   which appear to be novel, uncultured species.},

Abstract = {The abundance and diversity of filamentous fungi in the bottom sediments
   of the Arctic Ocean seas (the Greenland, Barents, and Kara seas) were
   studied. Samples of the surface bottom sediments were collected during
   the 84th (July-August 2021) and 86th (October-November 2021) cruises of
   RV Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. The taxonomic affiliation of the isolated
   fungi was determined using polyphasic taxonomy. The isolated fungi
   belonged to 16 genera of different classes of ascomycetous,
   basidiomycetous, and zygomycetous fungi. The effect of cultivation
   temperature and different NaCl concentrations on fungal growth was
   determined, as well as the effect of cultivation conditions on the fatty
   acid profile for the strains capable of growth on media with increased
   osmotic potential. While fatty acid composition was shown to be affected
   by changes in environmental conditions, the response to osmotic stress
   differed among the studied cultures from deep-sea sediments.},

   of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (High Arctic)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {This study assessed the diversity and distribution of fungal communities
   in eight marine sediments of Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, High Arctic) using
   454 pyrosequencing with fungal-specific primers targeting the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene. Sedimentary
   fungal communities showed high diversity with 42,219 reads belonging to
   113 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Of these OTUs, 62 belonged to
   the Ascomycota, 26 to Basidiomycota, 2 to Chytridiomycota, 1 to
   Zygomycota, 1 to Glomeromycota, and 21 to unknown fungi. The major known
   orders included Hypocreales and Saccharomycetales. The common fungal
   genera were Pichia, Fusarium, Alternaria, and Malassezia. Interestingly,
   most fungi occurring in these Arctic sediments may originate from the
   terrestrial habitats and different basins in Kongsfjorden (i.e., inner
   basin, central basin, and outer basin) harbor different sedimentary
   fungal communities. These results suggest the existence of diverse
   fungal communities in the Arctic marine sediments, which may serve as a
   useful community model for further ecological and evolutionary study of
   fungi in the Arctic.},

Journal = {POLISH POLAR RESEARCH},

Pages = {231-253},
Abstract = {Extreme cold environments like glaciers, present substantial obstacles
   to the survival of organisms. Cryoconite, dark sediment covering
   glacier, provide unique niche for microorganisms. Therefore, we focused
   on understanding the diversity of fungi in Arctic ecosystems (Hansbreen,
   Spitsbergen), which is important in the analysis of the structure and of
   fungi populations. Due to a combination of two incubation temperatures
   (7 degrees C or 24 degrees C) and two media during isolation (potato
   dextrose agar, PDA or yeast extract peptone glucose, YPG), and
   classical/molecular identification approaches, we identified 20
   different fungi (17 species and three unassigned species). Most belonged
   to filamentous fungi within the Ascomycota (19 isolates), with one
   identified as Basidiomycota-yeast. Regarding growth conditions, both
   media yielded greater number of fungal cultures at 24 degrees C compared
   to 7 degrees C. Additionally, PDA was more effective than YPG in
   isolating fungal cultures. On the other hand, the optimal temperature
   for achieving the highest CFU (colony-forming unit)/g of sediment was 7
   degrees C. The most frequently isolated species was Cladosporium
   cladosporioides, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
   detect, the following species in an Arctic environment: Aspergillus
   jensenii, A. tennesseensis, Peziza varia, and Trichoderma
   paraviridescens. Additionally, there was a visible increase in the
   number of fungal propagules but a decrease in their biodiversity towards
   the upper parts of the glacier. Considering the Arctic amplification
   there is a need for further research on diversity and function of fungi
   in glacial ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Two strains of a psychrophilic basidiomycetous yeast species belonging
   to the genus Vishniacozyma were isolated from sediments and soil at the
   front of a retreating glacier on northern Ellesmere Island in the
   Canadian Arctic. Analysis of the large subunit D1/D2 region and the
   internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the rDNA indicated that
   these strains represented a novel species. The closest relatives of the
   novel species were Vishniacozyma globispora and V. dimennae, which
   exhibited sequence similarities of 82.2 and 81.6 \%, respectively, to
   the ITS region of the novel species, and contained 61 and 57 nt
   substitutions, respectively, in the D1/D2 domain, in comparison with the
   novel species. Strains of the novel species were able to grow at
   sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free medium. These characteristics
   allow the strains to survive and grow in perennially cold, oligotrophic
   habitats in the Canadian High Arctic. The name Vishniacozyma
   ellesmerensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JCM 32573(T)
   (=UAMH 11973(T) =G3-4-8(T)) and the MycoBank number is MB825501.},

Abstract = {A fungal strain, Penicillium chrysogenum A096, was isolated from an
   Arctic sediment sample. Its culture supernatant inhibited mycelial
   growth of some plant pathogenic fungi. After saturation of P.
   chrysogenum A096 culture supernatant with ammonium sulfate and ion
   exchange chromatography, a novel antifungal protein (Pc-Arctin) was
   purified and identified by matrix assisted laser desorption
   ionization-time of flight-time of flight-mass spectrometry
   (MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS). The gene encoding for Pc-Arctin consisting of 195
   nucleotides was cloned from P. chrysogenum A096 to confirm the mass
   spectrometry result. Pc-Arctin displays antifungal activity against
   Paecilomyces variotii, Alternaria longipes, and Trichoderma viride at
   minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 24, 48, and 192 ng/disc,
   respectively. Pc-Arctin was most sensitive to proteinase K and then to
   trypsin but insensitive to papain. Pc-Arctin possesses high
   thermostability and cannot be antagonized by common surfactants, except
   for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Divalent ions, such as Mn2+, Mg2+, and
   Zn2+, inhibited the antifungal activity of Pc-Arctin. Hemagglutination
   assays showed that Pc-Arctin had no hemagglutinating or hemolytic
   activity against red blood cells (RBC) from rabbits, rats, and guinea
   pigs. Therefore, Pc-Arctin from Arctic P. chrysogenum may represent a
   novel antifungal protein with potential for application in controlling
   plant pathogenic fungal infection.},

Title = {Penicillium solitum: a mesophilic, psychrotolerant fungus present

Abstract = {Few studies have addressed the diversity of cultivable fungi from marine
   sediments, especially those from Antarctica. In the present study, we
   evaluated the presence and distribution of cultivable fungi in marine
   core sediments obtained from 100, 500, 700 and 1,100 m below the
   Antarctic Ocean surface. Fifty-two fungal isolates were identified as
   Penicillium solitum by their physiological and morphological
   characteristics, and the identity of 12 representative isolates was
   further confirmed by sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and beta-tubulin
   genes. P. solitum displayed high sequence similarity to Penicillium taxa
   that have been described from other marine habitats. Conidial
   germination of P. solitum occurred at low temperatures and high
   salinities. In addition, P. solitum displayed extracellular amylasic and
   esterasic activities. The isolation of P. solitum from marine sediments
   in Antarctica and its survival at low temperatures and high salt
   concentrations suggest that it is adapted to the cold and halophilic
   environment of the Antarctic oceans. Because P. solitum produces
   extracellular enzymes, it is an interesting eukaryotic model for the
   study of structure-function relationships during enzymatic biocatalysis
   and biotransformation under extreme conditions. Marine sediments from
   Antarctica may represent a unique source for obtaining extremophilic
   fungi. New studies using different culture media, temperatures ranges
   and pressure conditions as well as metagenomic techniques can assist in
   understanding the extremophilic fungal communities in marine sediments
   across the Antarctic Ocean.},

Abstract = {The mycobiota of bottom sediments at depths of 128-472 m was
   investigated in Barents and Kara sea areas remote from the shore. The
   species composition and fungal abundance, that is, the number of fungal
   colony-forming units (CFUs), were determined in 5 samples from the Kara
   Sea and in 14 samples of the Barents Sea. For the first time for the
   Arctic seas, the fungal biomass was determined in 12 samples of the
   bottom sediments from the Barents Sea. It was found that fungal
   abundance in the bottom sediments of the both seas did not exceed 13
   CFUs per 1 g of dry substrate weight. In total, only 58 colonies of
   filamentous fungi belonging to 22 morphotypes, 8 of which were sterile,
   were isolated from all the samples. No more than six morphotypes were
   contained in 1 g of dried substrate; they were mostly species of the
   genus Cladosporium and sterile isolates. The study of the fungal biomass
   detected both spores and fungal mycelium in the bottom sediments. The
   total biomass was extremely low and ranged from 0.1 to 0.620 mg/g of the
   studied substrate. Small spores (with a diameter less than 3 mu m)
   absolutely predominated (from 88 to 99.7\% of the biomass).},

Abstract = {We present the first study on the quantity and diversity of the
   mycobiota in bottom sediments of the Chukchi Sea. During implementation
   of the RUSALCA-2012 program, 22 samples of bottom sediments from depths
   of 44-110 m were collected in late August-early September 2012. Fungi
   were isolated on agarized media (salinity 35 psu, temperature 6 degrees
   C). Species identification was performed by morphological-cultural and
   molecular-genetic methods based on the nucleotide sequences of ITS1-ITS2
   rDNA. A total of 128 colonies of mycelial fungi were isolated; 0 to 22
   propagules were obtained from each 1 cm(3) sample. The overall diversity
   was represented by 48 morphotypes belonging to 32 genera in 15 orders of
   ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. Ascomycetes predominated both in number
   and diversity. A number of species were found in marine ecosystems for
   the first time. The taxonomic position of nonsporulating isolates (13\%
   of the total) was established using molecular techniques. Among them,
   high diversity was observed in the orders Pleosporales and Helotiales
   (Ascomycota).},

Abstract = {Four strains isolated from sediment sampled at the front of a retreating
   glacier on northern Ellesmere Island in the Canadian high Arctic, namely
   JCM 32575(T), JCM 32576, JCM 32577 and JCM 32578, belong to a novel
   psychrophilic basidiomycetous yeast species in the genus Mrakia.
   Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that these strains are most
   closely related to the type strains of Mrakia aquatica and Mrakianic
   combsii, but with 8-9 and 7-12 nt substitutions in ITS and in the D1 /D2
   domain of the LSU rRNA gene, respectively. The strains grew at sub-zero
   temperatures and in vitamin-free media, with lipase and cellulase highly
   active even at -3 degrees C. These characteristics likely allow this
   yeast species to grow and survive in extremely cold, oligotrophic
   environments, such as the fronts of retreating glaciers in the high
   Arctic. The name Mrakia hoshinonis sp. nov. is proposed, with type
   strain JCM 32575(T) (UAMH 11969) and MycoBank number MB 825484.},

Title = {An Integrative Study of Mycobiome in Different Habitats from a High
   Arctic Region: Diversity, Distribution, and Functional Role},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUNGI},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the Arctic ecosystems, fungi are crucial for interactions between
   soil and plants, the cycling of nutrients, and the transport of carbon.
   To date, no studies have been conducted to thoroughly examine the
   mycobiome and its functional role in various habitats of the High Arctic
   region. The aim was to unravel the mycobiome in the nine habitats (i.e.,
   soil, lichen, vascular plant, moss, freshwater, seawater, marine
   sediment, dung, and marine alga) in the Ny-angstrom lesund Region
   (Svalbard, High Arctic) using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A
   total of 10,419 ASVs were detected. Among them, 7535 ASVs were assigned
   to unidentified phyla, while the remaining 2884 ASVs were assigned to 11
   phyla, 33 classes, 81 orders, 151 families, 278 genera, and 261 species
   that were known. The distribution of the mycobiome was driven by habitat
   specificity, indicating that habitat filtering is a crucial factor
   influencing the fungal assemblages at a local scale in this High Arctic
   region. Six growth forms and 19 fungal guilds were found. The ecological
   guild (e.g., lichenized, ectomycorrhizal) and growth form (e.g., yeast,
   thallus photosynthetic) varied significantly among various habitats. In
   addition, the occurrence of 31 fungal species that are considered to be
   potential pathogens was determined. These results will increase our
   understanding of fungal diversity and its functional significance in
   this distinctive High Arctic area and thereby establish the groundwork
   for prediction about how the mycobiome will alter in various
   environments as a result of anticipated climate change.},

Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Abstract = {Many filamentous fungi were isolated from the soils of Ny-Alesund,
   Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and were screened in vitro for their phosphate
   solubilizing ability. Two strains of Aspergillus niger showed good
   tricalcium phosphate (TCP) solubilizing ability in Pikovskaya's medium.
   The TCP solubilization index was calculated at varying levels of pH and
   temperatures. The ability of Aspergillus niger strain-1 to solubilize
   and release inorganic-P was 285 mu g ml(-1), while Aspergillus niger
   strain-2 solubilized 262 mu g ml(-1) from 0.5\% TCP after seven days.
   This is the first report of TCP solubilization by Arctic strains that
   may serve as very good phosphate solubilizers in the form of
   biofertilizer.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Arctic has become a hot spot for microbial
   research. However, fungal diversity in the Chukchi Sea (adjacent to the
   Arctic Ocean) is little known. The purpose of this study was to explore
   fungal diversity in sediments of the Chukchi Sea and the temperature
   adaptability of the cultured fungi. A total of 74 fungal strains were
   isolated from nine marine sediment samples collected from the Chukchi
   Sea. These fungi were identified based on morphological characteristics
   and sequence comparison of the internal transcribed spacers of the
   ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) with the GenBank reference sequence database.
   Amongst these fungi, 61 strains belonged to the Ascomycota and 13
   strains were affiliated with the Basidiomycota. The dominant genus was
   Penicillium. These fungal strains were cultured at 4 degrees C, 10
   degrees C, and 25 degrees C to determine their temperature adaptability.
   Most strains were able to grow at 4 degrees C, and Thelebolus
   ellipsoideus was identified as a psychrophilic fungus. Our results
   revealed a high fungal diversity in marine sediments of the Chukchi Sea
   and found that some fungal species (Penicillium chrysogenum, Eutypella
   scoparia, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium tenuissimum, C.
   perangustums and Thelebolus ellipsoideus) isolated from these sediments
   were able to grow at 10 degrees C and 4 degrees C.},

Abstract = {The fungus Psychrophilomyces antarcticus M.M. Wang \& Xing Z. Liu,
   previously known only from the QinghaiTibet Plateau and Antarctica, was
   isolated in the Arctic from sediments on the littoral of the Kara Sea
   (Shokalsky Island) and represented by strains VKM F-5025/CBS 151455 and
   VKM F-5026/CBS 151456. The macroand micro-morphology of the isolate was
   studied together with partial sequences of the DNA regions ITS, LSU,
   TEF1, and beta-TUB, as well as the optimal values for temperature, pH
   and salinity. Slight differences between our two isolates and previously
   known strains of P. antarcticus were found in morphology (colony color
   and shape, size of phialides and spores) and physiological traits
   (optimal growth temperature, range of acceptable temperature and pH
   values for growth, colony odor, and degree of mucosity under extreme
   conditions). However, the high similarity in the sequenced conservative
   DNA sequences from 100 to 97\% indicates that these slight morphological
   and physiological variations of the studied strains of P. antarcticus
   are intraspecific variation. Our study demonstrates that P. antarcticus
   is a cold-adapted poly-extreme tolerant species that can occur and
   function in extremely cold areas, such as high alpine, Antarctic, and
   Arctic regions.},

Abstract = {The fungus strain SCSIO 40433 was isolated from an Arctic-derived

   structures of these compounds were elucidated by comprehensive
   spectroscopic analyses. Cylindromicin (1) featured a
   3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran skeleton. The absolute configuration of compound 1
   was assigned via interpretation of key Nuclear Overhauser Effect
   Spectroscopy (NOESY) correlations and Electronic Circular Dichroism
   (ECD) calculation. Cylindromicin (1) exhibited significant tyrosinase
   inhibition activity. This study highlights Polar fungi as a potential

Abstract = {Despite feather fungi being an important component of the Arctic fungal
   flora, their ecological role and diversity are not fully known. In the
   current study, fungal cultures were isolated from feathers (barnacle
   goose, common eider, and glaucous gull) collected in the Ny-lesund
   region, Svalbard. Isolates were identified by ITS region sequences,
   which include the ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S rRNA. The result showed
   culturable yeast and filamentous fungi belonging to three classes:
   Ascomycota (Pyrenochaetopsis pratorum, Cladosporium herbarum, Thelebolus
   microsporus, Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium commune, and Venturia
   sp.), Basidiomycota (Mrakia blollopis and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa), and
   Zygomycota (Mucor flavus). Most of the fungal isolates appeared to be
   cold-tolerant, and about 60 \% of the isolates showed keratinase
   activity. The reasonably low fungal diversity colonizing feathers
   indicates that the birds of Svalbard are casual carriers of fungi which
   may result in a negligible impact on their health. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first record of fungal communities present on the
   feathers of birds in the high Arctic.},

Abstract = {Arctic regions are experiencing the greatest rates of climate warming on
   the planet and marked changes have already been observed in terrestrial
   arctic ecosystems. While most studies have focused on the effects of
   warming on arctic vegetation and nutrient cycling, little is known about
   how belowground communities, such as fungi root-associated, respond to
   warming. Here, we investigate how long-term summer warming affects
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. We used Ion Torrent sequencing
   of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region to compare ECM
   fungal communities in plots with and without long-term experimental
   warming in both dry and moist tussock tundra. Cortinarius was the most
   OTU-rich genus in the moist tundra, while the most diverse genus in the
   dry tundra was Tomentella. On the diversity level, in the moist tundra
   we found significant differences in community composition, and a sharp
   decrease in the richness of ECM fungi due to warming. On the functional
   level, our results indicate that warming induces shifts in the
   extramatrical properties of the communities, where the species with
   medium-distance exploration type seem to be favored with potential
   implications for the mobilization of different nutrient pools in the
   soil. In the dry tundra, neither community richness nor community
   composition was significantly altered by warming, similar to what had
   been observed in ECM host plants. There was, however, a marginally
   significant increase in OTUs identified as ECM fungi with the
   medium-distance exploration type in the warmed plots. Linking our
   findings of decreasing richness with previous results of increasing ECM
   fungal biomass suggests that certain ECM species are favored by warming
   and may become more abundant, while many other species may go locally
   extinct due to direct or indirect effects of warming. Such compositional
   shifts in the community might affect nutrient cycling and soil organic C
   storage.},

Abstract = {Two strains of a psychrophilic basidiomycetous yeast species belonging
   to the genus Mrakia were isolated from a melt-pool mat community, on an
   ice island located in Disraeli Fjord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian
   Arctic. Analysis of the large subunit rDNA D1/D2 domain and internal
   transcribed spacer region sequences indicated that these strains
   represent a novel species, and the name Mrakia arctica sp. nov. is
   proposed. This new species could grow at sub-zero temperatures and in
   vitamin-free media. Moreover, lipase and cellulase enzymes of M. arctica
   were strongly active even at -3 degrees C. These results suggest an
   important role for M. arctica in the biogeochemical cycle of glacial
   ecosystems. (C) 2017 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by

Title = {Biogeography and uniqueness of filamentous terrestrial fungi in the
   polar regions},
Journal = {FUNGAL BIOLOGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {49},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fungi are widely distributed on our planet, including in extremely harsh
   habitats, such as the polar regions. The extreme conditions of those
   habitats limit the number of organisms capable of living there, but some
   fungi are adapted to the polar conditions and play essential roles in
   nutrient cycling. However, knowledge about their diversity,
   distribution, and functioning is fragmented, and approaches used to
   study them are diverse, often yielding difficult-to-compare results. We
   present maps with locations of mycological studies in the Arctic and
   Antarctica, as well as a list of mycelial fungi found on various
   terrestrial substrates through cultivation on nutrient media and/or
   molecular methods. These fungi were identified to the species level
   based on morphological-cultural features or gene-sequence analysis.
   Analysis of the methods applied to study fungi in different substrates
   shows that a combination of multiple methods is optimal to study species
   composition. The taxonomic affiliation of the identified species to
   different fungal divisions is largely determined by habitat conditions
   and research methods. The largest number of species belongs to the
   divisions Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The predominant ecological
   groups were saprotrophic and symbiotic fungi. The majority of 1324
   discovered fungal species are known as cosmopolitan species.
   Approximately one-fifth of the fungi were identical between the Arctic
   and Antarctica, only a few species are known to be endemic to Antarctica
   or Arctic, and there are 1-6 identified bipolar species. Claims of
   endemism of polar-region fungi are relatively weakly supported.},

Abstract = {Fungi are widely distributed in all terrestrial ecosystems, and they are
   essential to the recycling of nutrients in all terrestrial habitats on
   earth. We wanted to determine the relationship between soil fungal
   communities and geochemical factors (geographical location and soil
   physicochemical properties) in three widely separated geographical
   regions (the Antarctic, Arctic, and Tibet Plateau). Using
   high-throughput Illumina amplicon sequencing, we characterized the
   fungal communities in 53 soil samples collected from the three regions.
   The fungal richness and diversity indices were not significantly
   different among the three regions. However, fungal community composition
   and many fungal taxa
   (Thelebolales,Verrucariales,Sordariales,Chaetothyriales,Hypocreales,Pleo
   sporales,Capnodiales, andDothideales) significantly differed among three
   regions. Furthermore, geographical location (latitude and altitude) and
   six soil physicochemical properties (SiO42--Si, pH, NO3--N, organic
   nitrogen, NO2--N, and organic carbon) were significant geochemical
   factors those were correlated with the soil fungal community
   composition. These results suggest that many geochemical factors
   influence the distribution of the fungal species within the Antarctic,
   Arctic, and Tibet Plateau.},

Abstract = {The basidiomycetous yeast, Glaciozyma antarctica, was isolated from
   various terrestrial materials collected from the Soya coast, East

   antarctica was then cultured on frozen media containing red food
   coloring to observe the dynamics of solutes in unfrozen water; pigments
   accumulated in frozen yeast colonies, indicating that solutes were
   concentrated in unfrozen water of yeast colonies. Moreover, the yeast
   produced a small quantity of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) which inhibited
   ice crystal growth. Solutes in unfrozen water were considered to
   accumulate in the pore of frozen colonies. The extracellular IBPs may
   have held an unfrozen state of medium water after accumulation in the

Abstract = {Given that changes in the patterns of vegetation and size of carbon (C)
   pools in the Arctic are likely to be profound by the end of this
   century, it is necessary to characterise the identity and ecological
   groupings, in terms of temperature response and C substrate utilisation,
   of saprotrophic (decomposer) fungi in organic matter in Arctic soils.
   Thus, the aims of this study were: (1) to identify the fungi isolated
   from standing-dead material of Schistidium apocarpum, as an example of a
   High Arctic moss, (2) to determine mycelial extension rates of these
   fungi at a range of temperatures (4, 10 and 25 degrees C), and (3) to
   characterise the functional potential, defined by C substrate
   utilisation at 6 degrees C, of fungal taxa.
   Fungi were isolated at 4 degrees C from standing-dead material of S.
   apocarpum from an area of polar semi-desert (79 degrees N), close to
   Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, in the High Arctic. From a collection of 662
   isolates, 43 pure cultures were identified by DNA extraction,
   amplification, and sequencing. Phoma sclerotioides, previously known as
   a temperate snow mould, was isolated most frequently. The ecology of
   fifteen fungal isolates was characterised in detail. In terms of
   temperature response, two groups were apparent, one of truly
   psychrophilic/psychrotrophic fungi and one of more mesophilic fungi
   which were generally less frequently isolated. In terms of carbon
   substrate utilisation in semi-defined solid media, most fungi could
   utilise a variety of carbon substrates (degradation of casein, cellulose
   and starch was widespread), except for tannic acid (degraded by only two
   of the five P. sclerotioides isolates and Scytalidium lignicola) and
   lignin and chitin (not decomposed by any isolate). The majority of
   isolates had been recorded previously from polar environments and/or as
   being able to survive at low temperatures.
   Fungi in tundra ecosystems, therefore, have significant potential to
   mineralise C at temperatures below 10 degrees C. A better understanding
   of the ecology of these fungi will allow us to improve predictions of C
   dynamics in arctic biomes in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Root and soil samples from 13 collecting sites located in the Canadian
   High Arctic were harvested between July 18 and 29, 1991, and surveyed
   for root colonization and spore populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi. Grasses of the genus Festuca (Festuca brachyphylla Schult. \&
   Schult., Festuca baffinensis Polunin, and Festuca hyperborea Holmen ex
   Frederiksen) served as target plants. Of the 197 plant-root systems and
   soil rhizospheres examined, 28\% were associated with arbuscular
   mycorrhizae. Roots of both F: brachyphylla and F: baffinensis were
   colonized, while none were detected in F. hyperborea root specimens.
   Five arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species were extracted from
   indigenous soils. The most frequent and abundant species was Glomus
   mosseae (Nicol. \& Gerd.) Gerdemann \& Trappe, which was isolated from 8
   of the 13 sites sampled. Other Glomales species in Arctic soils were
   Glomus macrocarpum Tul \& Tul., Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxter sensu
   Gerd.) Gerd. \& Trappe emend. Walker \& Koske, and two other
   unidentified Glomus species. Trap cultures of the indigenous soil with
   leek (Allium porrum L.) plants confirmed the identity of the species
   previously identified from original soil and allowed the detection of an
   additional species, Glomus aggregatum Schenck. \& Smith. The novelty of
   these observations and the relationship between plant mycorrhizal
   status, fungal species, and soil disturbance are discussed.},

Abstract = {We aimed to investigate the phosphate solubilization by filamentous
   fungi isolated from Antarctic lichen and sediment. The results yielded a
   total of 80 strains, 9 of which were positive for phosphate
   solubilization in solid NBRIP medium. Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 and
   Penicillium steckii 5Y.P4 showed the largest halos, indicating their
   potential in phosphate solubilization. Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 was the
   most efficient phosphorus (P) solubilizer with maximum P levels of
   106.14 mg/L at 15 degrees C and 80.89 mg/L at 25 degrees C. This strain
   also showed solubilization activity at 0.5 M NaCl with P levels of
   127.93 mg/L. At pH 8.0, the P content was 137.93 mg/L, and glucose was
   the best carbon source (P 146.55 mg/L). Moreover, the isolated fungus
   showed activity only with tricalcium phosphate as an inorganic phosphate
   source. During the solubilization process, Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1
   released formic, malic, and succinic acids by the 15th day of incubation
   (P 208.99 mg/L). These findings indicate that Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1
   from Antarctic sediment has the potential to solubilize phosphate and
   thus unveils new possibilities for the agricultural sector, aimed to
   reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers.},

Abstract = {Arctic ecosystems are altered profoundly by climate changes. However,
   the responses of Arctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems as well as
   their biodiversity to global warming remain largely unknown. This
   article provides comprehensive insights into the results and major
   findings from the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) Project ?
   an Arctic region research program initiated in Japan, which aims to
   address and advance our understanding of these uncertainties. Marine
   ecosystem studies have identified several biogeochemical processes that
   are associated with sea ice decline and northward transport and shift of
   marine species across multiple trophic levels over the Bering and
   Chukchi Sea shelves. Studies of the terrestrial ecosystem have
   identified factors that are important for the understanding of
   terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems, including Arctic lakes, under
   the presence of global warming. Novel fungal species from the Arctic
   terrestrial ecosystem have also been isolated and described. Overall,
   these results could contribute to the conservation and sustainable
   management of the Arctic ecosystem services.},

Title = {Urbanization Affects Soil Microbiome Profile Distribution in the Russian
   Arctic Region},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urbanization in the Arctic results in considerable and still poorly
   known environmental consequences. The effect of urbanization on soil
   microbiome-an ecosystem component highly sensitive to anthropogenic
   disturbance-remains overlooked for the Arctic region. The research
   compared chemical and microbial properties of the natural Podzol soils
   and urban soils of Murmansk-the largest Arctic city. Particular
   attention was given to the profile distribution, which is almost
   completely ignored by most microbial studies. Soil microbiome was
   investigated by the quantitative indicators based on fluorescence
   microscopy (microbial biomass) and PCR real-time methods (amount of rRNA
   genes copies of archaea, bacteria, and fungi). The principal changes in
   urban soils' properties compared to the natural references included a
   shift in pH and an increase in C and nutrients' contents, especially
   remarkable for the subsoil. The numbers of rRNA genes copies of archaea,
   bacteria, and fungi in urban topsoils (10(6)-10(10), 10(9)-10(10), and
   10(7)-10(9), respectively) were lower than in Podzol; however, the
   opposite pattern was shown for the subsoil. Similarly, the total
   microbial biomass in urban topsoils (0.55-0.75 mg g(-1)) was lower
   compared to the 1.02 mg g(-1) in Podzols, while urban subsoil microbial
   biomass was 2-2.5 times higher than in the natural conditions. Both for
   urban and natural soils and throughout the profiles, fungi were
   dominated by mycelium forms; however, the ratios of mycelium-spores were
   lower, and the amount of thin mycelium was higher in urban soils than in
   natural Podzols. Urbanization in the Arctic altered soil morphological
   and chemical properties and created a new niche for microbial
   development in urban subsoils; its contribution to biodiversity and
   nutrient cycling promises to become increasingly important under
   projected climate change.},

Abstract = {The increasing amount of plastic waste causes significant environmental
   pollution. In this study, screening of Arctic microorganisms which are
   able to degrade bioplastics was performed. In total, 313 microorganisms
   were isolated from 52 soil samples from the Arctic region (Spitsbergen).
   Among the isolated microorganisms, 121 (38.66\%) showed biodegradation
   activity. The ability of clear zone formation on emulsified
   poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) was observed for 116
   microorganisms (95.87\%), on poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) for 73
   microorganisms (60.33\%), and on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) for
   102 microorganisms (84.3\%). Moreover, the growth of microorganisms on
   poly(lactic acid) (PLA) agar plates was observed for 56 microorganisms
   (46.28\%). Based on the 16S rRNA sequence, 10 bacterial strains which
   showed the highest ability for biodegradation were identified as species
   belonging to Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodococcus sp. The isolated fungal
   strains were tested for polycaprolactone films and commercial corn and
   potato starch bags degradation under laboratory conditions. Strains 16G
   (based on the analysis of a partial 18S rRNA sequence, identified as
   Clonostachys rosea) and 16H (identified as Trichoderma sp.) showed the
   highest capability for biodegradation. A particularly high capability
   for biodegradation was observed for the strain Clonostachys rosea, which
   showed 100\% degradation of starch films and 52.91\% degradation of PCL
   films in a 30-day shake flask experiment. The main advantage of the
   microorganisms isolated from Arctic environment is the ability to grow
   at low temperature and efficient biodegradation under this condition.
   The data suggest that C. rosea can be used in natural and laboratory
   conditions for degradations of bioplastics.},

Abstract = {During a research cruise in 2016, we isolated fungi from sediments,
   seawater, driftwood, fruiting bodies, and macroalgae using three
   different media to assess species richness and potential bioactivity of
   cultivable marine fungi in the High Arctic region. Ten stations from the
   Svalbard archipelago (73-80 degrees N, 18-31 degrees E) were
   investigated and 33 fungal isolates were obtained. These grouped into 22
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using nuc rDNA internal transcribed
   spacer regions (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) with acut-off set at 98\%
   similarity. The taxonomic analysis showed that 17 OTUs belonged to
   Ascomycota, one to Basidiomycota, two to Mucoromycota and two were
   fungal-like organisms. The nuc rDNA V1-V5 regions of 18S (18S) and D1-D3
   regions of 28S (28S) were sequenced from representative isolates of each
   OTU for comparison to GenBank sequences. Isolates of Lulworthiales and
   Eurotiales were the most abundant, with seven isolates each. Among the
   22 OTUs, nine represent potentially undescribed species based on low
   similarity to GenBank sequences and 10 isolates showed inhibitory
   activity against Gram-positive bacteria in an agar diffusion plug assay.
   These results show promise for the Arctic region as asource of novel
   marine fungi with the ability to produce bioactive secondary metabolites
   with antibacterial properties.},

Abstract = {Microbial symbionts are essential for plant niche expansion into novel
   habitats. Dormant propagules of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are thought
   to play an important role in seedling establishment in invasion fronts;
   however, propagule bank communities above the treeline are poorly
   understood in the Eurasian Arctic, where treelines are expected to
   advance under rapid climate change. To investigate the availability of
   EM fungal propagules, we collected 100 soil samples from Arctic tundra
   sites and applied bioassay experiments using Larix cajanderi as bait
   seedlings. We detected 11 EM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
   by obtaining entire ITS regions. Suillus clinto-nianus was the most
   frequently observed OTU, followed by Cenococcum geophilum and
   Sebacinales OTU1. Three Suillus and one Rhizo-pogon species were
   detected in the bioassay seedlings, indicating the availability of
   Larix-specific suilloid spores at least 30 km from the contemporary
   treeline. Spores of S. clintonianus and S. spectabilis remained
   infective after preservation for 14 mo and heat treatment at 60 ??C,
   implying the durability of the spores. Long-distance dispersal
   capability and spore resistance to adverse conditions may represent
   ecological strategies employed by suilloid fungi to quickly associate
   with emerging seedlings of compatible hosts in treeless habitats.},

Abstract = {Extreme environments such as the Antarctic can lead to the discovery of
   new microbial taxa, as well as to new microbial-derived natural
   products. Considering that little is known yet about the diversity and
   the genetic resources present in these habitats, the main objective of
   this study was to evaluate the fungal communities from extreme
   environments collected at Aldmiralty Bay (Antarctica). A total of 891
   and 226 isolates was obtained from soil and marine sediment samples,
   respectively. The most abundant isolates from soil samples were
   representatives of the genera Leucosporidium, Pseudogymnoascus, and a
   non-identified Ascomycota NIA6. Metschnikowia sp. was the most abundant
   taxon from marine samples, followed by isolates from the genera
   Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus. Many of the genera were exclusive in
   marine sediment or terrestrial samples. However, representatives of
   eight genera were found in both types of samples. Data from non-metric
   multidimensional scaling showed that each sampling site is unique in
   their physical-chemical composition and fungal community.
   Biotechnological potential in relation to enzymatic production at
   low/moderate temperatures was also investigated. Ligninolytic enzymes
   were produced by few isolates from root-associated soil. Among the fungi
   isolated from marine sediments, 16 yeasts and nine fungi showed lipase
   activity and three yeasts and six filamentous fungi protease activity.
   The present study permitted increasing our knowledge on the diversity of
   fungi that inhabit the Antarctic, finding genera that have never been
   reported in this environment before and discovering putative new species
   of fungi.},

Title = {Arctic driftwood reveals unexpectedly rich fungal diversity},
Journal = {FUNGAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Pages = {58-65},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Arctic driftwood can provide unique insight into the diversity of
   colonizing and decaying fungi at the interface of extremely cold
   terrestrial and marine environments. Entering the Arctic Ocean via large
   boreal river systems and being transported by currents and sea ice,
   driftwood is finally deposited along shallow coastlines. Here, we
   sequence 177 fungal cultures in driftwood from Iceland, Greenland and
   the Siberian Lena Delta. Although some fungi may survive during ice
   drift, most species are not shared among the different sampling sites.
   Many indigenous Arctic fungi are generalists in their ability to
   colonize and decompose organic substrata, with massive effects on carbon
   cycling. Cadophora species are the most frequent Ascomycota, and soft
   rot is the most prevalent form of decay. Few Basidiomycota were found,
   with many of them having poor sequence matches to known species. Future
   research is warranted with a focus on the biology, ecology and taxonomy
   of Arctic driftwood inhabiting fungi. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Evidence from recent Mars landers identified the presence of
   perchlorates salts at 1 wt \% in regolith and their widespread
   distribution on the Martian surface that has been hypothesized as a
   critical chemical hazard for putative life forms. However, the
   hypersaline environment may also potentially preserve life and its
   biomolecules over geological timescales. The high concentration of
   natural perchlorates is scarcely reported on Earth. The presence of
   perchlorates in soil and ice has been recorded in some extreme
   environments including the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica, one of the
   best terrestrial analogues for Mars. In the frame of ``Life in space{''}
   Italian astrobiology project, the polyextremophilic black fungus
   Cryomyces antarcticus, a eukaryotic test organism isolated from the
   Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities, has been tested for its
   resistance, when grown on different hypersaline substrata. In addition,
   C. antarcticus was grown on Martian relevant perchlorate medium (0.4
   wt\% of Mg(ClO4)(2) and 0.6 wt\% of Ca(ClO4)(2)) to investigate the
   possibility for the fungus to survive in Martian environment. Here, the
   results indicate a good survivability and metabolic activity recovery of
   the black fungus when grown on four Martian relevant perchlorates. A low
   percentage of damaged cellular membranes have been found, confirming the
   ultrastructural investigation.},

Abstract = {The effect of hydrocarbon pollution on the fungal communities of
   littoral sediments of the cold-water White and Barents seas was
   investigated. The samples were collected at locations with different
   levels of pollution with oil products, from ports to relatively
   undisturbed areas. Using the diesel fuel-containing medium resulted in
   detection of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi in almost all studied samples,
   although in all cases they were less diverse than sugar-degrading fungi.
   In this relatively small group, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium
   brevicompactum were the most common organisms. Fungal communities
   isolated on a sugar-containing medium exhibited higher diversity and
   abundance, with being the most common sugar degraders. The major factors
   affecting the structure of the fungal communities were the percentage of
   hydrocarbons in the total mass of organic carbon in the samples in the
   case of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi and location, for sugar degraders.
   In the experiment, the highest hydrocarbon-degrading activity was shown
   for Penicillium chrysogenum (the loss of residual hydrocarbons was
   77.4\%), Cadophora fastigiata (72\%), and Tolypocladium inflatum
   (67.2\%).},

Title = {Characterization of yeast and filamentous fungi isolated from cryoconite
   holes of Svalbard, Arctic},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Cryoconite holes have biogeochemical, ecological and biotechnological
   importance. This communication presents results on culturable
   psychrophilic yeast and filamentous fungi from cryoconite holes at Midre
   Lov,nbreen glacier. The identification of these microbes was achieved
   through conventional and DNA sequencing techniques. Effect of
   temperature, salt and media on growth of the cultures was studied.
   Measurements on the bioavailability of nutrients and trace metals were
   made through different methods including ICPMS (Inductively Coupled
   Plasma Mass Spectrometry). Colony forming unit (CFU) per gram of
   sediment sample was calculated to be about 7 x 10(3)-1.4 x 10(4) and 4 x
   10(3)-1.2 x 10(4) of yeast and filamentous fungi, respectively. Based on
   morphology and sequence data, these were identified as Cryptococcus
   gilvescens, Mrakia sp., Rhodotorula sp., Phialophora alba and
   Articulospora tetracladia. Amongst these, Phialophora alba, Cryptococcus
   gilvescens and Mrakia sp. zhenx-1 are reported for the first time from
   Svalbard Arctic, while Rhodotorula sp. (95\% gene similarity) is a new
   species, yet to be described. Rhodotorula sp. expressed high amylase,
   while Cryptococcus gilvescens showed high lipase activity. Mrakia sp.
   showed phosphate solubilization between 4 and 15A degrees C, which is a
   first record. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of organic carbon,
   nitrogen and phosphorus in substantial amounts in the sediments.
   Filamentous fungi and yeast in the cryoconite holes drive the process of
   organic macromolecule degradation through cold-adapted enzyme secretion,
   thereby assisting in nutrient cycling in these subglacial environments.
   Further, these cold-adapted enzymes may provide an opportunity for the
   prospect of biotechnology in Arctic. This is the first report on
   mycological investigation into cryoconite holes from Midre Lov,nbreen
   glacier.},

Title = {Diversity and Distribution of Aquatic Fungal Communities in the
   Ny-lesund Region, Svalbard (High Arctic)},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {We assessed the diversity and distribution of fungi in 13 water samples
   collected from four aquatic environments (stream, pond, melting ice
   water, and estuary) in the Ny-lesund Region, Svalbard (High Arctic)
   using 454 pyrosequencing with fungi-specific primers targeting the
   internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene.
   Aquatic fungal communities in this region showed high diversity, with a
   total of 43,061 reads belonging to 641 operational taxonomic units
   (OTUs) being found. Of these OTUs, 200 belonged to Ascomycota, 196 to
   Chytridiomycota, 120 to Basidiomycota, 13 to Glomeromycota, and 10 to
   early diverging fungal lineages (traditional Zygomycota), whereas 102
   belonged to unknown fungi. The major orders were Helotiales, Eurotiales,
   and Pleosporales in Ascomycota; Chytridiales and Rhizophydiales in
   Chytridiomycota; and Leucosporidiales and Sporidiobolales in
   Basidiomycota. The common fungal genera Penicillium, Rhodotorula,
   Epicoccum, Glaciozyma, Holtermanniella, Betamyces, and Phoma were
   identified. Interestingly, the four aquatic environments in this region
   harbored different aquatic fungal communities. Salinity, conductivity,
   and temperature were important factors in determining the aquatic fungal
   diversity and community composition. The results suggest the presence of
   diverse fungal communities and a considerable number of potentially
   novel fungal species in Arctic aquatic environments, which can provide
   reliable data for studying the ecological and evolutionary responses of
   fungi to climate change in the Arctic ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Aims To explore rhizospheric microbial communities from Arctic native
   plant species evaluating their bacterial hydrocarbon-degrading
   capacities. Methods and Results Eriophorum scheuchzeri, Potentilla cf.
   rubricaulis, Oxyria digyna, Salix arctica and Puccinellia angustata
   plant species were collected at Eureka (Canadian high Arctic) along with
   their rhizospheric soil samples. Their bacterial community fingerprints
   (16S rRNA gene, DGGE) were distinctive encompassing members from the
   phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria.
   Isolated diesel-degrading bacteria belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria
   and Proteobacteria. Strains of Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus,
   Intrasporangiaceae, Leifsoni and Arthrobacter possessed alkB and
   Pseudomonas possessed both ndoB and xylE gene sequences. Two Rhodococcus
   strains mineralized {[}1-14C] hexadecane at 5 and -5 degrees C. From the
   rhizosphere of P. angustata, larger numbers of hydrocarbon-degrading
   bacteria were isolated than from other plant rhizosphere samples and all
   three genes alkB (from Actinobacteria), ndoB and xylE (from Pseudomonas)
   were detected by PCR. Conclusions (i) Arctic plants have unique
   rhizospheric bacterial communities. (ii) P. angustata has potential for
   phytoremediation research at high Arctic soils. (iii) Isolated bacteria
   mineralized hydrocarbons at ambient low temperatures. Significance and
   Impact of the Study To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   rhizospheric exploration examining the phytoremediation potential of
   five Arctic plants and evaluating their microbial hydrocarbon-degrading

   Habitats},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {In cold environments such as polar regions, microorganisms play
   important ecological roles, and most of our knowledge about them comes
   from studies of cultivable microorganisms. Metagenomic technologies are
   powerful tools that can give a more comprehensive assessment of
   microbial communities, and the amplification of rDNA followed by
   next-generation sequencing has given good results in studies aimed
   particularly at environmental microorganisms. Culture-independent
   studies of microbiota in terrestrial habitats of Antarctica, which is
   considered the driest, coldestclimate on Earth, are increasing and
   indicate that micro-diversity is much higher than previously thought. In
   this work, the microbial diversity of terrestrial habitats including
   eight islands of the South Shetland Archipelago, two islands on the
   Antarctic Peninsula and Union Glacier, was studied by
   amplicon-metagenome analysis. Molecular analysis of the studied
   localities clustered together the islands of the South Shetland
   Archipelago, except Greenwich Island, and separated them from the
   Litchfield and Lagotellerie islands and Union Glacier, which is in
   agreement with the latitudinal difference among them. Among fungi, 87
   genera and 123 species were found, of which species belonging to 37
   fungal genera not previously cultivated from Antarctica were detected.
   Phylogenetic analysis, including the closest BLAST-hit sequences,
   clustered fungi in 11 classes being the most represented Lecanoromycetes
   and Eurotiomycetes.},

Abstract = {We tested the effects of solar radiation, and UV-B in particular, on the
   growth of Antarctic terrestrial fungi. The growth responses to solar
   radiation of five fungi, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum, Pythium sp.,
   Verticillium sp., and Mortierella parvispora, each isolated from
   Antarctic terrestrial habitats, were examined on an agar medium in the
   natural Antarctic environment. A 3-h exposure to solar radiation of >287
   nm reduced the hyphal extension rates of all species relative to
   controls kept in the dark. Pythium sp. cultures exposed to solar
   radiation for 1.5 h on five consecutive days were most sensitive to
   radiation of >287 nm, but radiation of >313 nm also inhibited growth to
   a lesser extent. Radiation of >400 nm had no effect on hyphal growth
   relative to controls kept in the dark. Short-wave solar UV-B radiation
   of between 287 and 305 nm inhibited the growth of Pythium sp. hyphae on
   and below the surface of the agar medium after 24 h, but radiation of
   greater than or equal to345 nm only reduced the growth of surface
   hyphae. Similar detrimental effects of UV-B on surface and, to a lesser
   extent, submerged hyphae of all five fungi were shown in the laboratory
   by using artificial UV-B from fluorescent lamps. A comparison of growth
   responses to solar radiation and temperature showed that the species
   that were most resistant to UV radiation grew fastest at higher
   temperatures. These data suggest that solar UV-B reduces the growth of
   fungi on the soil surface in the Antarctic terrestrial environment.},

Abstract = {Plant nitrogen (N) use is a key component of the N cycle in terrestrial
   ecosystems. The supply of N to plants affects community species
   composition and ecosystem processes such as photo-synthesis and carbon
   (C) accumulation. However, the availabilities and relative importance of
   different N forms to plants are not well understood. While nitrate
   (NO3-) is a major N form used by plants worldwide, it is discounted as a
   N source for Arctic tundra plants because of extremely low NO3-
   concentrations in Arctic tundra soils, undetectable soil nitrification,
   and plant-tissue NO3- that is typically below detection limits. Here we
   reexamine NO3- use by tundra plants using a sensitive denitrifier method
   to analyze plant-tissue NO3-. Soil-derived NO3- was detected in tundra
   plant tissues, and tundra plants took up soil NO3- at comparable rates
   to plants from relatively NO3--rich ecosystems in other biomes. Nitrate
   assimilation determined by N-15 enrichments of leaf NO3- relative to
   soil NO3- accounted for 4 to 52\% (as estimated by a Bayesian
   isotope-mixing model) of species-specific total leaf N of Alaskan tundra
   plants. Our finding that in situ soil NO3- availability for tundra
   plants is high has important implications for Arctic ecosystems, not
   only in determining species compositions, but also in determining the
   loss of N from soils via leaching and denitrification. Plant N uptake
   and soil N losses can strongly influence C uptake and accumulation in
   tundra soils. Accordingly, this evidence of NO3- availability in tundra
   soils is crucial for predicting C storage in tundra.},

Title = {Soil pH is a Key Determinant of Soil Fungal Community Composition in the
   Ny-Alesund Region, Svalbard (High Arctic)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {This study assessed the fungal community composition and its
   relationships with properties of surface soils in the Ny-Alesund Region
   (Svalbard, High Arctic). A total of thirteen soil samples were collected
   and soil fungal community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing with fungi
   specific primers targeting the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
   region. The following eight soil properties were analyzed: pH, organic
   carbon (C), organic nitrogen (N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), silicate
   silicon (SiO42--Si), nitrite nitrogen (NO2- -N), phosphate phosphorus
   (PO43- -P), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N). A total of 57,952 reads
   belonging to 541 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found, of these
   OTUs, 343 belonged to Ascomycota, 100 to Basidiomycota, 31 to
   Chytridiomycota, 22 to Glomeromycota, 11 to Zygomycota, 10 to
   Rozellomycota, whereas 24 belonged to unknown fungi. The dominant orders
   were Helotiales, Verrucariales, Agaricales, Lecanorales,
   Chaetothyriales, Lecideales, and Capnodiales. The common genera (> eight
   soil samples) were Tetracladium, Mortierella, Fusarium, Cortinarius, and
   Atla. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-rda) and analysis of
   similarities (ANOSIM) revealed that soil pH (p = 0.001) was the most
   significant factor in determining the soil fungal community composition.
   Members of Verrucariales were found to predominate in soils of pH 8-9,
   whereas Sordariales predominated in soils of pH 7-8 and Coniochaetales
   predominated in soils of pH 6-7. The results suggest the presence and
   distribution of diverse soil fungal communities in the High Arctic,
   which can provide reliable data for studying the ecological responses of
   soil fungal communities to climate changes in the Arctic.},

Abstract = {Arctic soils are constantly subjected to extreme environmental
   conditions such as low humidity, strong winds, high sa-linity,
   freeze-thaw cycles, UV exposition, and low nutrient availability,
   therefore, they have developed unique micro-bial ecosystems. These
   environments provide excellent opportunities to study microbial ecology
   and evolution within pristine (i.e. with limited anthropogenic
   influence) regions since the High Arctic is still considered one of the
   wildest and least explored environments on the planet. This environment
   is also of interest for the screening and recovery of unique microbial
   strains suitable for various biotechnological applications. In this
   study, a combination of culture -depended and culture-independent
   approaches was used to determine the cultivation bias in studies of the
   diversity of cold-active microorganisms. Cultivation bias is a reduction
   in recovered diversity, introduced when applying a clas-sical culturing
   technique. Six different soil types, collected in the vicinity of the
   Polish Polar Station Hornsund (Spits-bergen, Norway), were tested. It
   was revealed that the used media allowed recovery of only 6.37 \% of
   bacterial and 20 \% of fungal genera when compared with a
   culture-independent approach. Moreover, it was shown that a combina-tion
   of R2A and Marine Broth media recovered as much as 93.6 \% of all
   cultivable bacterial genera detected in this study. Based on these
   results, a novel protocol for genome-guided bioprospecting, combining a
   culture-dependent ap-proach, metabarcoding, next-generation sequencing,
   and genomic data reuse was developed. With this methodology, 14
   psychrotolerant, multi-metal-resistant strains, including the highly
   promising Rhodococcus spp., were obtained. These strains, besides
   increased metal tolerance, have a petroleum hydrocarbon utilization
   capacity, and thus may be good candidates for future bioremediation
   technologies, also suited to permanently cold regions.},

Title = {An arctic community of symbiotic fungi assembled by long-distance

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Aim Current evidence from temperate studies suggests that
   ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi require overland routes for migration
   because of their obligate symbiotic associations with woody plants.
   Despite their key roles in arctic ecosystems, the phylogenetic diversity
   and phylogeography of arctic ECM fungi remains little known. Here we
   assess the phylogenetic diversity of ECM communities in an isolated,
   formerly glaciated, high arctic archipelago, and provide explanations
   for their phylogeographic origins.
   Location Svalbard.
   Methods We generated and analysed internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
   nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences from both curated sporocarp collections
   (from Svalbard) and soil polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clone libraries
   (from Svalbard and the North American Arctic), compared these with
   publicly available sequences in GenBank, and estimated the phylogenetic
   diversity of ECM fungi in Svalbard. In addition, we conducted coalescent
   analyses to estimate migration rates in selected species.
   Results Despite Svalbard's geographic isolation and arctic climate, its
   ECM fungi are surprisingly diverse, with at least 72 non-singleton
   operational taxonomic units (soil) and 109 phylogroups (soil +
   sporocarp). The most species-rich genera are Thelephora/Tomentella,
   Cortinarius and Inocybe, followed by Hebeloma, Russula, Lactarius,
   Entoloma, Sebacina, Clavulina, Laccaria, Leccinum and Alnicola. Despite
   the scarcity of available reference data from other arctic regions, the
   majority of the phylogroups (73.4\%) were also found outside Svalbard.
   At the same time, all putative Svalbard `endemics' were newly sequenced
   taxa from diverse genera with massive undocumented diversity. Overall,
   our results support long-distance dispersal more strongly than
   vicariance and glacial survival. However, because of the high variation
   in nucleotide substitution rates among fungi, allopatric persistence
   since the Pliocene, although unlikely, cannot be statistically rejected.
   Results from the coalescent analyses suggest recent gene flow among
   different arctic areas.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate numerous recent colonization
   events and suggest that long-distance, transoceanic dispersal is
   widespread in arctic ECM fungi, which differs markedly from the
   currently prevailing view on the dispersal capabilities of ECM fungi.
   Our molecular evidence indicates that long-distance dispersal has
   probably played a major role in the phylogeographic history of some ECM
   fungi in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results may have implications for
   studies on the biodiversity, ecology and conservation of arctic fungi in
   general.},

Abstract = {Soil micromorphology provides an excellent resource for investigating
   Palacoeskimo site-formation processes in the low arctic periglacial
   environment. In this study, micromorphology was used to answer questions
   concerning the composition, structure, origin and depositional agencies
   of the Tayara site active layer's sediments as well as to distinguish
   between natural (geogenic, biopedogenic) and cultural (anthropogenic)
   processes. Five groups of microfeatures were documented. These include
   1) biopedological features (soil organic matter accumulation, mesofaunal
   and fungal activities), 2) transport-inherited features related to
   depositional processes (solifluction and stream sedimentation), 3)
   frost-induced microstructures and cryogenic features such as major
   post-depositional changes (ice-segregation, particle rearrangement.
   frost shattering. cryoturbation), 4) bone preservation in the active
   layer at the microscopic level, and 5) anthropogenic features related to
   Palaeoeskimo activities. The sediments from the three archaeological
   levels (1, {[}A and II) appear to have been very little influenced by
   anthropogenic factors. Cultural processes are micromorphologically
   observed in level II, with some evidence of feeding (bone presence),
   burning (wood charcoal, heated bone), and possibly trampling. However,
   the effects of natural processes on the sediments are more pronounced
   than anthropogenic ones. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We accessed the culturable mycobiota present in marine sediments at
   different depths in Antarctica Ocean. Acremonium fusidioides,
   Penicillium allii-sativi, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium palitans,
   Penicillium solitum, and Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus were identified.
   Penicillium allii-sativi was the dominant species. At least one isolate
   of each species was capable to present antifungal, trypanocidal,
   leishmanicidal, antimalarial, nematocidal, or herbicidal activities.
   Penicillium produced extracts with strong trypanocidal and antimalarial
   activities, and the extracts of P. solitum and P. chrysogenum
   demonstrated strong antimalarial activities. Acremonium fusidioides and
   P. verrucosus displayed strong selective herbicidal properties. The H-1
   NMR signals for extracts of A. fusidioides, P. chrysogenum, and P.
   solitum indicated the presence of highly functionalized secondary
   metabolites, which may be responsible for the biological activities
   detected. In the deep marine Antarctic sediments, we detected fungal
   assemblages in which the Penicillium species were found to be dominant
   and demonstrated capabilities to survive and/or colonise that
   poly-extreme habitat. Penicillium being a polyextremophile Antarctic
   species, exhibited strong biological activities and the presence of
   aromatic compounds in its extracts may indicate that they are wild
   ancient strains with high genetic and biochemical potentials that enable
   them to produce bioactive compounds which can be researched in further
   studies and used in the chemotherapy of neglected tropical diseases as
   well as in agriculture.},

Abstract = {Two new pimarane diterpenes, libertellenone M (1) and libertellenone N
   (2), together with five known compounds were isolated from the culture
   extract of Eutypella sp. D-1 derived from high-latitude soil of the
   Arctic. The structures of these compounds were determined by
   spectroscopic data as well as experimental and calculated electronic
   circular dichroism (ECD) analysis. Antimicrobial and cytotoxic
   activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated. Compound 3
   exhibited weak antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus
   subtilis, and Vibrio vulnificus, each with MIC values of 16g/mL.
   Compounds 2 and 3 showed moderate cytotoxic activity against K562 and
   MCF-7 cell lines with IC50 values of 7.67 and 9.57m, respectively.},

Title = {Recovering greater fungal diversity from pristine and diesel fuel
   contaminated sub-Antarctic soil through cultivation using both a high
   and a low nutrient media approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {Novel cultivation strategies for bacteria are widespread and well
   described for recovering greater diversity from the ``hitherto{''}
   unculturable majority. While similar approaches have not yet been
   demonstrated for fungi it has been suggested that of the 1.5 million
   estimated species less than 5\% have been recovered into pure culture.
   Fungi are known to be involved in many degradative processes, including
   the breakdown of petroleum hydrocarbons, and it has been speculated that
   in Polar Regions they contribute significantly to bioremediation of
   contaminated soils. Given the biotechnological potential of fungi there
   is a need to increase efforts for greater species recovery, particularly
   from extreme environments such as sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. In
   this study, like the yet-to-be cultured bacteria, high concentrations of
   nutrients selected for predominantly different fungal species to that
   recovered using a low nutrient media. By combining both media approaches
   to the cultivation of fungi from contaminated and non-contaminated
   soils, 91 fungal species were recovered, including 63 unidentified
   species. A preliminary biodegradation activity assay on a selection of
   isolates found that a high proportion of novel and described fungal
   species from a range of soil samples were capable of hydrocarbon
   degradation and should be characterized further.},

Title = {Factors affecting water availability for high Arctic lichens},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {853-862},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Lichen symbiosis is a successful nutritional strategy that drives lichen
   distributions in high Arctic ecosystems. However, the in situ effects of
   fungal partners (mycobionts) on water availability for the
   photosynthetic partners (photobionts) and their necessity for survival
   remain unclear. We investigated the factors creating differences in
   water availability in high Arctic lichen assemblages using observational
   and experimental analyses of substrates and thallus morphology in the
   high Arctic, near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (79 degrees N) during the
   snow-free season. We used five lichen species found on five substrate
   types: moss litter, vascular plant litter, mixed litter, biological soil
   crust (BSC) and gravel. BSC had significantly higher water content than
   the other substrates; although it had high levels of surface
   evaporation, BSC took up more ground water. Moreover, the structure of
   BSC supported greater water retention than the four other substrates in
   our study, providing the moistest environment for lichens. In fact, 60
   \% of the surface area of the crustose lichen Ochrolechia frigida, which
   was mainly distributed on BSC, was in contact with the substrate. In
   contrast, the four fruticose lichens had larger surface areas than Och
   frig and roughly 90 \% air exposure. Initial rates of absorption and
   evaporation increased with greater thallus surface area, suggesting that
   water availability for photobionts is strongly affected by both
   morphological characteristics and substrate water properties, both of
   which depend on mycobionts. We conclude that lichens show preferences
   for both morphologies and substrates that promote autotrophic nutrition
   in the water-limited glacier foreland of the high Arctic region.},

Title = {The First Comprehensive Biodiversity Study of Culturable Fungal
   Communities Inhabiting Cryoconite Holes in the Werenskiold Glacier on
   Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, Arctic)},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Cryoconites are small cavities filled with water on the
   surface of glaciers in which microorganisms may develop during the
   thawing period. At the bottom of cryoconite holes, sediment accumulates,
   consisting of plant and animal debris and inorganic mineral particles.
   In this study, we provide the first report of fungal communities in
   cryoconite holes in the Werenskiold Glacier on Spitsbergen (Svalbard
   Archipelago, Arctic). Overall, we detected 21 species and 2 unassigned
   species, including micromycetes and macromycetes. Some of the fungi
   described may be harmful to humans or have biotechnological potential.
   Most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
   report the occurrence of Aspergillus pseudoglaucus, Cladosporium
   allicinum, C. ramotenellum, Penicillium sumatraense, P. velutinum,
   Phanerochaete cumulodentata, Bjerkandera adusta, and Trametes versicolor
   in polar regions. Cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces are a source of
   cold-adapted microorganisms, but little is known about their fungal
   inhabitants. Here, we provide the first report of distinctive fungal
   communities in cryoconite holes in the Werenskiold Glacier on
   Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, Arctic). Due to a combination of two
   incubation temperatures (7 degrees C and 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and two
   media during isolation (PDA, YPG), as well as classical and molecular
   identification approaches, we were able to identify 23 different fungi
   (21 species and 2 unassigned species). Most of the fungi cultured from
   cryoconite sediment were ascomycetous filamentous micromycetes. However,
   four representatives of macromycetes were also identified (Bjerkandera
   adusta, Holwaya mucida, Orbiliaceae sp., and Trametes versicolor). Some
   of the described fungi possess biotechnological potential (Aspergillus
   pseudoglaucus, A. sydowii, Penicillium expansum, P. velutinum, B.
   adusta, and T. versicolor), thus, we propose the Arctic region as a
   source of new strains for industrial applications. In addition, two
   phytopathogenic representatives were present (P. sumatraense, Botrytis
   cinerea), as well as one potentially harmful to humans (Cladosporium
   cladosporioides). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
   report the occurrence of A. pseudoglaucus, C. allicinum, C.
   ramotenellum, P. sumatraense, P. velutinum, P. cumulodentata, B. adusta,
   and T. versicolor in polar regions. In all likelihood, two unassigned
   fungus species (Orbiliaceae and Dothideomycetes spp.) might also be
   newly described in such environments. Additionally, due to experimenting
   with 10 sampling sites located at different latitudes, we were able to
   conclude that the number of fungal spores decreases as one moves down
   the glacier. Considering the prevalence and endangerment of glacial
   environments worldwide, such findings suggest their potential as
   reservoirs of fungal diversity, which should not be overlooked.},

Abstract = {This study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from
   filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from
   Antarctica and assess its potential antibacterial activity on
   Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, the agent of citrus canker. Metabolites
   production was conducted in Malt 2\% broth at 15 degrees C for 20days
   after which intracellular and extracellular extracts were obtained. The
   extracts were evaluated by cell viability assays through Resazurin
   Microtitre Assay. From 158 fungal extracts, 33 hampered bacterial growth
   invitro. The average inhibition of the extracts obtained from
   terrestrial (soil) and marine (sediments) fungi was 94 and 97\%
   respectively. These inhibition values were close to the average of 90\%
   cell death for the positive control. MIC90 and MBC for the bioactive
   extracts were established. Isolates that produced active metabolites
   against the phytopathogen were identified using molecular taxonomy
   (ITS-rRNA sequencing) as: Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium, Cadophora,
   Paraconiothyrium and Toxicocladosporium. Antarctic fungal strains
   isolated from terrestrial and marine sediments were able to produce
   secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. citri
   subsp. citri, highlighting the importance of these microbial genetic
   resources. These metabolites have potential to be used as alternatives
   for the control of this plant pathogen.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis manuscript makes an impact on
   the study of micro-organisms from extreme habitats and their possible
   contribution in discovering new active molecules against pathogens of
   agricultural interest. Studies on the Antarctic continent and its
   communities have attracted the scientific community due to the long
   period of isolation and low levels of disturbance that surrounds the
   region. Knowing the potential of fungi in this region to produce active
   secondary metabolites, we aim to contribute to the discovery of
   compounds with antibacterial action in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, a
   plant pathogen present in several regions around the globe.},

Abstract = {The study of the secondary metabolites of the relict strain Penicillium
   citrinum VKM FW-800 isolated from ancient Arctic permafrost sediments
   showed that this fungus produces agroclavine-1 and epoxyagroclavine-1,
   which are rare ergot alkaloids with the 5R, 10S configuration of the
   tetracyclic ergoline ring system. The production of the alkaloids by the
   fungus showed a biphasic behavior, being intense in the phase of active
   growth and slowing down in the adaptive lag phase and in the stationary
   growth phase. The addition of zinc ions to the incubation medium led to
   a fivefold increase in the yield of the alkaloids. The
   alkaloid-producing Penicillium fungi isolated from different regions
   exhibited the same tendencies of growth and alkaloid production.},

Abstract = {Deception Island is a geothermal location in Antarctica that presents
   active fumaroles, which confers unique characteristics to this habitat.
   Several studies about microbial communities in Antarctica have been
   carried out, nevertheless, Antarctic microbiota is still partially
   unknown. Here we present a multidisciplinary study about sediments
   obtained by deposition during 4 years in which several approaches have
   been considered for their characterization. First, a physicochemical
   characterization, using ionic chromatography and mass spectrometry for
   the determination of most abundant ions (chloride and sulphate) and
   elements (mainly silicon), was conducted. In addition, the total
   microbial community was studied using a metataxonomical approach,
   revealing a bacterial community dominated by Proteobacteria and
   Thaumarchaeota as the main archaeal genera and a fungal community mainly
   composed by Aspergillaceae. Culture-dependent studies showed low
   microbial diversity, only achieving the isolation of Bacillus-related
   species, some of them thermophilic, and the isolation of common fungi of
   Aspergillus or Penicillium spp. Furthermore, diatoms were detected in
   the sediment and characterized attending to their morphological
   characteristics using scanning electron microscopy. The study reveals a
   high influence of the physicochemical conditions in the microbial
   populations and their distribution, offering valuable data on the
   interaction between the island and water microbiota.},

Abstract = {The recovery of culturable microorganisms from ancient materials,
   ranging from a few thousand to several million years old, has generated
   interest in the long-term survival capabilities of micrororganisms. We
   report the occurrence of such paleobes for the first time from a
   deep-sea sediment core obtained from a depth of 5904 m from the Chagos
   trench in the Indian Ocean. Culturable fungi, direct counts of bacteria,
   age of the sediments based on the radiolarian assemblage, total organic
   carbon, Eh and CaCO3 were determined in these sediments. Culturable
   fungi were obtained from subsections up to 370 cm depth. The age of the
   sediments from which fungi were isolated was estimated to range
   from>0.18 to 0.43 million years (Ma), being the oldest recorded age for
   recovery of culturable fungi. Colony forming units of fungi ranged from
   69 to 2493 g(-1) dry weight sediment with a maximum abundance recorded
   at 160 cm depth of the core, corresponding to similar to0.18 Ma.
   Bacterial numbers in the core showed oscillations corresponding to
   cycles of approximately 100 ka (kilo years). The fungi comprised
   non-sporulating forms and a sporulating form identified to be
   Aspergillus sydowii. Germination of spores of A. sydowii at 100, 300 and
   500 bar hydrostatic pressures at 5 degreesC confirmed its barotolerance
   and its nativity to deep-sea sediments. We propose that deep-sea
   sediments are a source of paleobes, which could be useful in studies on
   palaeoclimate, long-term microbial survival and biotechnology. (C) 2004

Title = {High-temperature optima phosphatases from the cold- tolerant Arctic
   fungus Penicillium citrinum},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},
Abstract = {Fifty-six fungal isolates from Arctic soils were subjected to primary
   screening for their ability to solubilize insoluble inorganic phosphate.
   Nine of the isolates were further analysed quantitatively for
   phosphatase production using para-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate.
   Amongst these, a cold-tolerant fungus, Penicillium citrinum strain PG162
   was found to be the best producer of intracellular acid phosphatase.
   Further characterization of the enzyme showed that it is most active in
   the temperature range of 40-60 degrees C and pH range of 4.2-4.8. The
   dried enzyme extract is stable at a temperature of up to 50 degrees C
   for at least 1 h. Its activity is affected by presence of metal ions.
   Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
   analysis suggests the molecular weight of the enzyme to be between 20
   and 29 kDa. The present study is important with respect to our
   understanding of the kind of enzymatic reactions that take place in the
   polar microbes, and the extent to which their activity is sustained.},

Title = {Deepened winter snow significantly influences the availability and forms
   of nitrogen taken up by plants in High Arctic tundra},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {222-234},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change may alter nutrient cycling in Arctic soils and plants.
   Deeper snow during winter, as well as summer warming, could increase
   soil temperatures and thereby the availability of otherwise limiting
   nutrients such as nitrogen (N). We used fences to manipulate snow depths
   in Svalbard for 9 consecutive years, resulting in three snow regimes: 1)
   Ambient with a maximum snow depth of 35 cm, 2) Medium with a maximum of
   100 cm and 3) Deep with a maximum of 150 cm. We increased temperatures
   during one growing season using Open Top Chambers (OTCs), and sampled
   soil and vascular plant leaves throughout summer 2015. Labile soil N,
   especially inorganic N, during the growing season was significantly
   greater in Deep than Ambient suggesting N supply in excess of plant and
   microbial demand. However, we found no effect of Medium snow depth or
   short-term summer temperature increase on soil N, presumably due to
   minor impacts on soil temperature and moisture. The temporal patterns of
   labile soil N were similar in all snow regimes with high concentrations
   of organic N immediately after snowmelt, thereafter dropping towards
   peak growing season. Concentrations of all N forms increased at the end
   of summer. Vascular plants had high N at the start of growing season,
   decreasing as summer progressed, and leaf N concentrations were highest
   in Deep, corresponding to the higher soil N availability. Short-term
   summer warming was associated with lower leaf N concentrations,
   presumably due to growth dilution. Deeper snow enhanced labile soil
   organic and inorganic N pools and plant N uptake. Leaf N-15 natural
   abundance levels (delta N-15) in Deep indicated a higher degree of
   utilization of inorganic than organic N, which was especially pronounced
   in mycorrhizal plants.},

Abstract = {Mosses are a dominant component of high-arctic terrestrial ecosystems,
   yet little is known regarding the abundance and diversity of fungi
   associated with these abundant plants. We investigated vertical patterns
   of abundance and diversity of fungi and their relationship with chemical
   properties within profiles of Hylocomium splendens and Racomitrium
   lanuginosum collected in the Oobloyah Bay area on Ellesmere Island,
   Canada. The moss profiles were divided into 6 (H. splendens) and 5 (R.
   lanuginosum) layers according to the color and texture, and hyphal
   length, fungal assemblages, and contents of organic chemical components
   (acid-unhydrolyzable residues, total carbohydrates, extractives) and
   nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) were measured. Total hyphal length was
   greatest at the middle layers of H. splendens and at the deepest layers
   of R. lanuginosum and was significantly affected by moss species and
   nutrient contents. A total of 18 and 19 fungal taxa was isolated from
   the profiles of H. splendens and R. lanuginosum, respectively, with 11
   taxa being common to both moss species. Moss species significantly
   affected the species distribution of fungi. Individual fungal taxa
   showed patterns of vertical distribution within the moss profiles. The
   contents of acid-unhydrolyzable residues and nutrients increased and the
   content of total carbohydrates decreased down the profile, which was
   attributable to the ability of fungi to decompose carbohydrates
   selectively and to immobilize nutrients in decomposed moss residues. (C)

Abstract = {Endolichenic fungi within 17 lichen species in the area near Ny-lesund
   (Svalbard, High Arctic) were studied by a culture-based method. The 247
   fungal isolates were obtained from 2712 lichen thallus segments. The
   colonization rate of endolichenic fungi ranged from 1.6 to 26.5 \%,
   respectively. These isolates were identified to 40 fungal taxa,
   including 35 Ascomycota (10 orders), 4 Basidiomycota (3 orders), and 1
   unidentified fungus. Thelebolales was the most abundant order, while
   Sordariales were the most diverse order. The common fungal taxa shared
   by more than 3 lichen species were Thelebolus microsporus (93 isolates),
   Coniochaeta hoffmannii (7 isolates), Sarocladium kiliense (33 isolates),
   Coniochaeta sp. 1 (5 isolates), Coniochaeta sp. 4 (28 isolates), and
   Coniochaeta sp. 2 (5 isolates). Low Sorenson's similarity coefficients
   were observed among different lichen species, indicating that
   host-related factor may shape the endolichenic fungal communities in
   this region. In addition, no endolichenic fungal taxa were previously
   found in the Antarctica and Austrian Alps, suggesting endolichenic
   fungal communities in this region might be also shaped by the Arctic
   climate. The results demonstrate the existence of specific cultured
   endolichenic fungal species, which may be suitable objects for further
   study of their possible functional roles in the lichen thalli.},

Title = {Effects of temperature on extracellular hydrolase enzymes from soil
   microfungi},

Abstract = {Soil microbes play important roles in global carbon and nutrient
   cycling. Soil microfungi are generally amongst the most important
   contributors. They produce various extracellular hydrolase enzymes that
   break down the complex organic molecules in the soil into simpler form.
   In this study, we investigated patterns of amylase and cellulase (which
   are responsible for breaking down starch and cellulose, respectively)
   relative activity (RA) on solid media at different culture temperatures
   in fungal strains from Arctic, Antarctic and tropical soils. Fungal
   isolates from all three regions were inoculated onto R2A media
   supplemented with starch for amylase and carboxymethylcellulose and
   trypan blue for cellulase screening. The isolates were then incubated at
   4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 A degrees C and examined for activity
   after 5 and 10 days, for tropical and polar isolates, respectively. The
   data obtained indicate that the polar fungal strains exhibited similar
   patterns of amylase and cellulase RA. Both Arctic and Antarctic fungi
   showed highest RA for amylase and cellulase at 35 A degrees C, while
   colony growth was maximised at 15 A degrees C. Colony growth and RA of
   the polar isolates were negatively correlated suggesting that, as
   temperatures increase, the cells become stressed and have fewer
   resources available to invest in growth. Unlike polar isolates, tropical
   isolates did not exhibit any trend of colony growth with temperature,
   rather having idiosyncratic patterns in each isolate. The low enzyme
   production and RA levels in the tropical strains may suggest both a low
   ability to respond to temperature variation in their natural thermally
   stable tropical habitats, as well as a level of thermal stress limiting
   their enzyme production ability.},

Abstract = {2,000 microbial strains were isolated from soil samples and tested to
   determine their lipolytic activity by employing screening techniques on
   solid and in liquid media. Culture broths were initially tested with
   1,2-O-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid-resorufinyl ester, a
   chromogenic substrate specific for lipases. Fourteen lipase-producing
   microorganisms were selected and their taxonomic identification was
   carried out. Hydrolysis of tributyrin or olive oil and the
   esterification of oleic acid with heptanol were selected to preliminary
   evaluate the catalytic activity of these lipases. All the selected
   lipases catalysed this esterification reaction with good yields.
   Resolution of (R,S)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid,
   (R,S)-1-phenylethanol, (R,S) 1-phenylethylamine and of (R) or (S)
   glycidol were performed to evaluate the stereoselectivity of these novel
   enzymes as biocatalysts in reactions in organic media. Lipases from the
   fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Ovadendron sulphureo-ochraceum gave the
   best yields and enantioselectivities in the resolution of racemic
   ibuprofen and 1-phenylethanol, Several lipases displayed a high
   stereoselectivity in the resolution of chiral amines by an
   alcoxycarbonylation reaction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {In the present study, a fungal strain isolated from the Antarctic soil
   was identified as Penicillium sp. CHY-2 based on its 5.8S rRNA gene
   sequence analysis. Furthermore, its biodegradation ability towards 13
   different toxic compounds such as 4-butylphenol (4-BP),
   4-sec-butylphenol (4-s-BP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), 4-nonylphenol
   (4-NP), 4-tertoctylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), phenol,
   bisphenol A (BPA), benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, and
   phenanthrene at low (4 degrees C) and medium (15 degrees C) temperature
   conditions was evaluated using high pressure liquid chromatography.
   Among the 13 compounds, the strain CHY-2 effectively degraded the six
   compounds i.e., 4-BP, 4-s-BP, 4-t-BP, 4-NP, 4-CP, and phenol at 15
   degrees C within one week, and at 4 degrees C within 3weeks. Also CHY-2
   effectively degraded the 4-t-OP at 15 degrees C (70\%), but not at 4
   degrees C (35\%). Among different carbon sources tested, glucose was
   found to be the most suitable and the growth of CHY-2 at 4 degrees C was
   slower than at 15 degrees C. Addition of Tween 80 increased the growth
   and degradation ability of CHY-2 towards 4-BP at 4 and 15 degrees C. The
   metabolites produced during the degradation of 4-BP were identified by
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Also, bacteria present in the
   Antarctic soil were determined by denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis and the result showed the presence of Pseudomonas and
   Syntrophus groups of bacteria.},

Abstract = {In the Arctic, fungal mycelial growth takes place mainly during the cold
   season and beginning of growing season. Climate change induced increases
   of cold season temperatures may, hence, benefit fungal growth and
   increase their abundance. This is of particular importance for parasitic
   fungi, which may significantly shape Arctic vegetation composition.
   Here, we studied two contrasting plant parasitic fungi's occurrences
   (biotrophic Exobasidium hypogenum Nannf. on the vascular plant Cassiope
   tetragona (L.) D. Don., and necrotrophic Pythium polare Tojo, van West
   \& Hoshino on the moss Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) Loeske) in response to
   increased snow depth, a method primarily used to increase cold season
   temperatures, after 7- 13 years of snow manipulation in Adventdalen,
   Svalbard. We show that enhanced snow depth increased occurrences of both
   fungi tested here and indicate that increased fungal infections of host
   plants were at least partly responsible for decreases of host
   occurrences. Although bryophyte growth, in general, may be influenced by
   increased soil moisture and reduced competition from vascular plants,
   Pythium polare is likely enhanced by the combination of milder winter
   temperatures and moister environment provided by the snow. The
   relationships between host plants and fungal infection indicate ongoing
   processes involved in the dynamics of compositional adjustment to
   changing climate.},

Abstract = {Fungal community associated with terrestrial Arctic moss, Tetraplodon
   mimoides was studied by examining fresh thallus tissue and adhered soil.
   The study resulted in the isolation of 46 microfungi belonging to 20
   species in 12 genera. These included seven non-sporulating morphotypes.
   To the best of our knowledge, species such as Botrytis verrucosa,
   Mortierella simplex, M. schmuckeri, Penicillium frequentans, P.
   rugulosum and Cladosporium chlorocephalum are new records to the study
   region. All isolates were tested for production of cold-adapted amylase,
   pectinase, cellulase, esterase, protease, phosphatase and urease. The
   cultures showed varying degrees of enzyme production, with two cultures
   producing all seven enzymes. The present study helps in understanding
   the fungal diversity associated with plants growing in extreme habitats.},

Title = {Occurrence and diversity of fungal entomopathogens in soils of low and

Abstract = {Knowledge of the occurrence, distribution and diversity of pathogens of
   insects and arachnids (entomopathogens) in the Arctic is very limited.
   Climate change is expected to affect Arctic terrestrial arthropod
   communities and therefore also host-pathogen interactions, given that
   entomopathogens are present. We conducted a survey of fungal
   entomopathogens in soil samples collected at four localities in
   Greenland; two at low Arctic sites (Ritenbenk and Disko Island) and two
   at sites in the high Arctic (Zackenberg and Danmarkshavn). Fungi were
   isolated from soil samples using larvae of the insect species Galleria
   mellonella (Lepidoptera) and Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera) as baits
   providing evidence that the fungal isolates were indeed
   entomopathogenic. Five fungal species (Ascomycota; Hypocreales) were
   found: Isaria fumosorosea Wize, Isaria farinosa (Holmsk.) Fr., Beauveria
   bassiana (Bals.) Vuill., Beauveria pseudobassiana Rehner and Humber and
   Tolypocladium inflatum W. Gams (syn. = T. niveum). I. farinosa was found
   at all four localities, while I. fumosorosea was detected in single
   samples at each of three localities including both high Arctic sites.
   Only the locality on Disko Island revealed B. bassiana, whereas B.
   pseudobassiana was isolated at the three other sites. T. inflatum was
   only found on Disko Island and only isolated with T. molitor as a bait
   insect. The results document that fungal entomopathogens are widely
   distributed in the soil environment in Greenland. Entomopathogens should
   therefore be included in future studies of arthropod ecology in the
   Arctic.},

Abstract = {The Antarctic and Arctic regions are collectively referred to as the
   ``Two Poles{''} of the earth and have extremely harsh climate conditions
   and fragile ecosystems. Until now, the biogeography of the fungal
   communities in the bipolar regions is not well known. In this study, we
   focused on the fungal communities in 110 samples collected from four
   habitat types (i.e., soil, vascular plant, freshwater, moss) in the
   Antarctic and Arctic sites using high-throughput sequencing. The data
   showed that the diversity and composition of fungal communities were
   both geographically patterned and habitat-patterned. ANOSIM tests
   revealed statistically significant differences among fungal communities
   in the eight sample types (R = 0.5035, p < 0.001) and those in the
   bipolar regions (R = 0.32859, p < 0.001). Only 396 OTUs (14.8\%) were
   shared between the bipolar sites. Fungal communities in the four habitat
   types clustered together in the Arctic site but were separate from those
   of the Antarctic site, indicating that geographic distance was a more
   important determinant of fungal communities in the bipolar sites. These
   findings offer insights into the present-day biogeography of fungal
   communities in the bipolar sites.},

Journal = {ARCTIC},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {65},

Pages = {45-55},

Abstract = {Soil filamentous fungi from Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen, were studied. A
   total of 30 fungal isolates were identified by morpho-taxonomy, and the
   identity of some morpho-taxonomically complex isolates was authenticated
   by ITS1-5.8S and ITS2 rDNA domain sequence similarity. The isolates
   belonged to 19 species under 14 genera (Acremonium, Arthrinium,
   Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Corynespora, Emericella, Geomyces,
   Mortierella, Mucor, Myrothecium, Penicillium, Phialophora, Preussia,
   Xylaria). To the best of our knowledge, Acremonium roseolum, Aspergillus
   aculeatus, Emericella nidulans, and Preussia sp. are the first
   northernmost records from Arctic soils. The viable fungal count in
   different soil samples varied from 0.5 x 10(4) to 2.0 x 10(5) g(-1).
   Species richness in different soil samples was also calculated.
   Mortierella was one of the most dominant genera in Arctic soils. A
   temperature tolerance study was carried out for all the isolates, and
   representative species were screened for their extracellular enzyme
   activity (amylase, cellulase, phosphatase, and pectinase) at 4 degrees C
   and 20 degrees C. Among the 30 isolates, seven showed cellulolytic
   activity, two were phosphate solubilizers, three had amylolytic
   activity, and only one showed pectinolytic activity on solid media.
   CMCase (beta 1, 4-endoglucanase) activity was quantified in seven
   isolates that exhibited positive activity during preliminary screening.
   The records of enzyme activity for amylases, pectinases, and cellulases
   are the first from the fungi of Spitsbergen. The present study indicates
   the dominance in Ny-Alesund of cellulolytic strains, which may serve as
   potent decomposers in Arctic tundra. These isolates may be used to
   facilitate the mineralization of cellulolytic wastes generated by human
   activities in colder hilly areas across the world, including the
   Himalayas in India.},

Abstract = {Fungi have been only rarely isolated from glacial ice in extremely cold
   polar regions and were in these cases considered as random, long-term
   preserved Aeolian deposits. Fungal presence has so far not been
   investigated in polar subglacial ice, a recently discovered extreme
   habitat reported to be inhabited exclusively by heterotrophic bacteria.
   In this study we report on the very high occurrence (up to 9000 CFU L-1)
   and diversity of filamentous Penicillium spp. in the sediment-rich
   subglacial ice of three different polythermal Arctic glaciers (Svalbard,
   Norway). The dominant species was P. crustosum, representing on the
   average half of all isolated strains from all three glaciers. The other
   most frequently isolated species were P. bialowiezense, P. chrysogenum,
   P. thomii, P. solitum, P. palitans, P. echinulatum, P. polonicum, P.
   commune, P. discolor, P. expansum, and new Penicillium species (sp. 1).
   Twelve more Penicillium species were occasionally isolated. The fungi
   isolated produced consistent profiles of secondary metabolites, not
   different from the same Penicillium species from other habitats. This is
   the first report on the presence of large populations of Penicillium
   spp. in subglacial sediment-rich ice.},

Abstract = {Antarctica's extreme environment and geographical isolation offers a
   useful platform for testing the relative roles of environmental
   selection and dispersal barriers influencing fungal communities. The
   former process should lead to convergence in community composition with
   other cold environments, such as those in the Arctic. Alternatively,
   dispersal limitations should minimise similarity between Antarctica and
   distant northern landmasses. Using high-throughput sequencing, we show
   that Antarctica shares significantly more fungi with the Arctic, and
   more fungi display a bipolar distribution, than would be expected in the
   absence of environmental filtering. In contrast to temperate and
   tropical regions, there is relatively little endemism, and a strongly
   bimodal distribution of range sizes. Increasing southerly latitude is
   associated with lower endemism and communities increasingly dominated by
   fungi with widespread ranges. These results suggest that microorganisms
   with well-developed dispersal capabilities can inhabit opposite poles of
   the Earth, and dominate extreme environments over specialised local
   species.},

Title = {A Widely Distributed Thraustochytrid Parasite of Diatoms Isolated from

Abstract = {A unicellular, heterotrophic, eukaryotic parasite was isolated from
   nearshore Arctic marine sediment in association with the diatom
   Pleurosigma sp. The parasite possessed ectoplasmic threads that could
   penetrate diatom frustules. Healthy and reproducing Pleurosigma cultures
   would begin to collapse within a week following the introduction of this
   parasite. The parasite (2-10 mu m diameter) could reproduce
   epibiotically with biflagellate zoospores, as well as binary division
   inside and outside the diatom host. While the parasite grew, diatom
   intracellular content disappeared. Evaluation of electron micrographs
   from co-cultures revealed the presence of hollow tubular processes and
   amorphic cells that could transcend the diatom frustule, generally at
   the girdle band, as well as typical thraustochytrid ultrastructure, such
   as the presence of bothrosomes. After nucleotide extraction,
   amplification, and cloning, database queries of DNA revealed closest
   molecular affinity to environmental thraustochytrid clone sequences.
   Testing of phylogenetic hypotheses consistently grouped this unknown
   parasite within the Thraustochytriidae on a distinct branch within the
   environmental sequence clade Lab19. Reclassification of Arctic
   high-throughput sequencing data, with appended reference datasets that
   included this diatom parasite, indicated that the majority of
   thraustochytrid sequences, previously binned as unclassifiable
   stramenopiles, are allied to this new isolate. Based on the combined
   information acquired from electron microscopy, life history, and
   phylogenetic testing, this unknown isolate is described as a novel
   species and genus.},

Title = {Taxonomic assessment and enzymes production by yeasts isolated from

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the taxonomic identity
   of yeasts isolated from the Antarctic continent and to evaluate their
   ability to produce enzymes (lipase, protease and xylanase) at low and
   moderate temperatures. A total of 97 yeast strains were recovered from
   marine and terrestrial samples collected in the Antarctica. The highest
   amount of yeast strains was obtained from marine sediments, followed by
   lichens, ornithogenic soils, sea stars, Salpa sp., algae, sea urchin,
   sea squirt, stone with lichens, Nacella concinna, sea sponge, sea isopod
   and sea snail. Data from polyphasic taxonomy revealed the presence of 21
   yeast species, distributed in the phylum Ascomycota (n = 8) and
   Basidiomycota (n = 13). Representatives of encapsulated yeasts,
   belonging to genera Rhodotorula and Cryptococcus were recovered from 7
   different Antarctic samples. Moreover, Candida glaebosa, Cryptococcus
   victoriae, Meyerozyma (Pichia) guilliermondii, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa
   and R. laryngis were the most abundant yeast species recovered. This is
   the first report of the occurrence of some species of yeasts recovered
   from Antarctic marine invertebrates. Additionally, results from enzymes
   production at low/moderate temperatures revealed that the Antarctic
   environment contains metabolically diverse cultivable yeasts, which
   could be considered as a target for biotechnological applications. Among
   the evaluated yeasts in the present study 46.39, 37.11 and 14.43 \% were
   able to produce lipase (at 15 A degrees C), xylanase (at 15 A degrees C)
   and protease (at 25 A degrees C), respectively. The majority of
   lipolytic, proteolytic and xylanolytic strains were distributed in the
   phylum Basidiomycota and were mainly recovered from sea stars, lichens,
   sea urchin and marine sediments.},

Title = {Does nitrogen deposition affect soil microfungal diversity and soil N

Abstract = {In a high Arctic polar semidesert ecosystem (ambient N deposition c. 0.1
   g N m(-2) a(-1)), the effects of N enrichment on the diversity of soil
   microfungi and on N content and availability in organic and mineral
   soils were determined. Three N (total: 0, 0.5, 5 g N m(-2) a(-1)) and
   two P (total 0, 1 g m(-2) a(-1)) treatments were applied, since P may
   limit response to N in this ecosystem. Organic and mineral soils were
   sampled in June and August in the second year of treatment for
   microfungi, pH, moisture content, and total N and P. In the third year,
   soils were resampled for extractable and total N and P. The fungi
   isolated were typical of high pH soils in the High Arctic and Antarctic.
   The species richness and diversity of soil microfungi were very low,
   with ranges as follows: Shannon diversity, 0.56-1.5; richness, 2-6;
   evenness, 0.79-0.9. There was no significant effect of treatment on the
   frequency of occurrence of different taxa of soil microfungi. Time of
   sampling also had no significant impact on fungal assemblages, although
   different, more diverse communities were isolated from organic, rather
   than mineral, soils. Nitrate-N in organic soil decreased significantly
   when P was added alone, but not when P and N were added together.
   Addition of 0.5 g N m(-2) a(-1), a rate deposition already occurring in
   Greenland and Iceland, appeared to exceed N demand even when P
   limitation was relieved. There was no apparent soil acidification as a
   result of the N treatments.},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {1484-1496},

Abstract = {Recent molecular evidence suggests a global distribution of marine
   fungi; however, the ecological relevance and corresponding biological
   contributions of fungi to marine ecosystems remains largely unknown. We
   assessed fungal biomass from the open Arctic Ocean by applying novel
   biomass conversion factors from cultured isolates to environmental
   sterol and CARD-FISH data. We found an average of 16.54 nmol m(-3) of
   ergosterol in sea ice and seawater, which corresponds to 1.74 mg C m(-3)
   (444.56 mg C m(-2) in seawater). Using Chytridiomycota-specific probes,
   we observed free-living and particulate-attached cells that averaged
   34.07 mu g C m(-3) in sea ice and seawater (11.66 mg C m(-2) in
   seawater). Summed CARD-FISH and ergosterol values approximate 1.77 mg C
   m(-3) in sea ice and seawater (456.23 mg C m(-2) in seawater), which is
   similar to biomass estimates of other marine taxa generally considered
   integral to marine food webs and ecosystem processes. Using the GeoChip
   microarray, we detected evidence for fungal viruses within the
   Partitiviridae in sediment, as well as fungal genes involved in the
   degradation of biomass and the assimilation of nitrate. To bridge our
   observations of fungi on particulate and the detection of degradative
   genes, we germinated fungal conidia in zooplankton fecal pellets and
   germinated fungal conidia after 8 months incubation in sterile seawater.
   Ultimately, these data suggest that fungi could be as important in
   oceanic ecosystems as they are in freshwater environments.},

Abstract = {Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various
   Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial
   activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic
   isolates (3.8\%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova
   Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three
   indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as
   the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus
   subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the
   eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans.
   Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and
   phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically
   affiliated to the Actinobacteria. (16 strains) and the
   gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as
   phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even
   though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the
   identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that
   these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.
   Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations
   and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel
   source of antibacterial substances.},

Title = {Antarctic Ardley Island terrace - An ideal place to study the marine to
   terrestrial succession of microbial communities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {The study of chronosequences is an effective tool to study the effects
   of environmental changes or disturbances on microbial community
   structures, diversity, and the functional properties of ecosystems.
   Here, we conduct a chronosequence study on the Ardley Island coastal
   terrace of the Fildes Peninsula, Maritime Antarctica. The results
   revealed that prokaryotic microorganism communities changed orderly
   among the six successional stages. Some marine microbial groups could
   still be found in near-coastal soils of the late stage (lowest stratum).
   Animal pathogenic bacteria and stress-resistant microorganisms occurred
   at the greatest level with the longest succession period. The main
   driving factors for the succession of bacteria, archaea, and fungi along
   Ardley Island terrace were found through Adonis analysis (PERMANOVA).
   During analysis, soil elements Mg, Si, and Na were related to the
   bacterial and archaeal community structure discrepancies, while Al, Ti,
   K, and Cl were related to the fungal community structure discrepancies.
   On the other hand, other environmental factors also play an important
   role in the succession of microbial communities, which could be
   different among each microorganism. The succession of bacterial
   communities is greatly affected by pH and water content; archaeal
   communities are greatly affected by NH4+; fungal communities are
   affected by nutrients such as NO3-. In the analysis of the
   characteristic microorganisms along terrace, the succession of
   microorganisms was found to be influenced by complex and comprehensive
   factors. For instance, environmental instability, relationship with
   plants and ecological niches, and environmental tolerance. The results
   found that budding reproduction and/or with filamentous appendages
   bacteria were enriched in the late stage, which might be connected to
   its tolerance to rapid changes and barren environments. In addition, the
   decline in ammonia oxidation capacity of Thaumarchaeota archaeade with
   succession and the evolution of the fungi-plant relationship throughout
   classes were revealed. Overall, this research improves the understanding
   of the effect of the marine-to-terrestrial transition of the Ardley
   Island terrace on microbial communities. These findings will lay the
   foundation for more in-depth research regarding microbial adaptations
   and evolutionary mechanisms throughout the marine-terrestrial transition
   in the future.},

Abstract = {Polar willow (Salix polaris Wahlenb.), a mycorrhizal dwarf shrub,
   colonizes recently deglaciated areas in the High Arctic, Svalbard. To
   clarify successional changes in ECM fungi associated with S. polaris
   after glacier retreat, we examined the diversity and density of ECM
   fungi in culture and field conditions. Plant and soil samples were
   collected from three sites of different successional stages in the
   deglaciated area of Austre Broggerbreen, near Ny-lesund, Svalbard. The
   successional stages were early stage with newly exposed bare ground
   (site I), transient stage with scattered colonization of Salix (sites
   IIa and IIb), and late stage with well-developed vegetation (site III).
   No ECM colonization on Salix was observed in soils collected from bare
   ground in early and transient stages (sites I and IIa). However, most
   Salix individuals showed ECM colonization in soils collected from sites
   close to Salix colonies in transient and late stages (sites IIb and
   III). Based on molecular analyses and operational taxonomic unit (OTU: >
   95\% ITS sequence similarity) delimitations, we identified 15
   OTUs/species in eight genera. The dominant OTU/species of ECM fungi
   identified in the transient and late stages was Geopora sp.1 and
   Cenococcum sp.1, respectively. In the culture experiment, ECM diversity
   was greater in late stage (eight OTUs/species) than in transient stage
   (three OTUs/species). This pattern was consistent with field
   observations, i.e., late-stage sites contained more OTUs/species of ECM
   fungi. These results indicate that species diversity of ECM fungi
   increases and the dominant species changes with the progress of
   succession after glacier retreat in the High Arctic.},

Abstract = {We assessed culturable soil microfungal diversity in various habitats
   around Hornsund, Spitsbergen in the High Arctic, using potato dextrose
   agar (PDA) medium. Thermal growth classification of the fungi obtained
   was determined by incubating them in 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C,

   from 12 soil samples, and grouped into 38 mycelial morphotypes.
   Intergenic spacer regions of these morphotypes were sequenced, and they
   represented 25 distinct taxonomic units, of which 21 showed sufficient
   similarity with available sequence data in NCBI to be identified to

Abstract = {Scarce research into the secondary metabolites of the fungi
   Pseudogymnoascus spp. has shown a hidden biosynthetic potential for
   biologically active compounds. This work investigated the biosynthesis
   of secondary metabolites by two Pseudogymnoascus fungal strains, VKM
   F-4518 and VKM F-4519, isolated from the surface soil layer of the
   Kolyma Lowland, Russia, in the Arctic. In these strains, 16-membered
   trilactone macrolides, (+)-macrosphelides A and B, were identified using
   1D and 2D NMR, UHRMS, and optical rotation data. In the fungi of this
   genus, these metabolites were found for the first time. The studied
   strains are highly active producers of macrosphelide A, which is being
   considered as a promising agent for the cure of cancer. Using the
   antiSMASH secondary metabolite analysis tool, we found that the genome
   of strain VKM F-4518 contained 32 of the biosynthetic clusters of the
   secondary metabolite genes (BGC) and that of VKM F-4519 had 17 BGCs.
   Based on the comparison of the cluster of macrotriolide genes from the
   fungus Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa, we found the complete supposed
   cluster BGCs of macrosphelides in the genomes of two Pseudogymnoascus
   strains using the BLAST+ program.},

Abstract = {Microfungi isolated from soil samples collected in Franz Joseph Land by
   means of the soil dilution and soil washing methods were screened for
   their ability to grow at low temperatures. The oligotrophic ability of
   the psychrotrophic strains was then determined on silica gel. A total of
   40 taxa from 21 genera were isolated. Most isolates were species of
   Acremonium, Geomyces, Mortierella, Phialophora, Phoma, Thelebolus and
   sterile fungi. Eutypella scoparia, Hyphozyma variabilis and Ovadendron
   sulphureo-ochraceum are new records as soil and Arctic fungi. Most
   fungal isolates were psychrotrophic. The few psychrooligotrophs were
   species of Geomyces, Phoma, Thelebolus and Mortierella. Overall, our
   results suggest that the major component of an Arctic soil mycoflora
   should be active in one or more short growing seasons interspersed with
   periods of prolonged dormancy. Only a minor component, such as the small
   group of psychrooligotrophic fungi found in this study, may be expected
   to show continuous slow growth.},

Abstract = {The biodiversity and terrestrial ecology of the Late Albian Triton Point
   Formation (Fossil Bluff Group), Alexander Island, Antarctica is analysed
   to improve our understanding of polar biomes during the mid-Cretaceous
   thermal optimum. This formation was deposited on a high-latitude (75
   degreesS) floodplain and consists of two facies associations, a lower
   braided alluvial plain unit and an upper coastal meander-belt unit.
   Analysis of fossil plants in well exposed palaeosols reveals the
   existence of spatially complex plant communities. Braidplains supported
   patchy, low-density (91 trees/ha) stands of podocarp and taxodioid
   conifers on floodbasin substrates, and
   conifer-cycadophyte-fern-angiosperm thickets in riparian settings.
   Coastal meander-belts supported medium density (568 trees/ha)
   podocarp-araucarian conifer forests on mature floodbasin soils, and
   fern-angiosperm-ginkgo thickets in riparian settings. Growth-ring
   analysis indicates plants experienced stressful growing conditions on
   the braidplain characterized by high-frequency flood events, but more
   favourable growing conditions on the coastal plain. Additional
   vegetation disturbances were caused by arthropod-fungal attack, frost
   and wildfire. In terms of structure, composition, ecology and
   productivity these predominantly evergreen, broad-leafed conifer forests
   bear similarities to the extant temperate rainforests of New Zealand.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Walker Glacier near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island in the
   Canadian High Arctic (terrestrial margin of the `Last Ice Area') is
   undergoing rapid ice attrition in response to climate change. We applied
   culture and molecular methods to investigate fungal diversity at the
   terminus of this glacier. Analysis of the mycoflora composition showed
   that the Walker Glacier isolates separated into two clusters: the
   surface of the glacier ice and the glacier foreland. The recently
   exposed sediments of the foreland had a lower fungal diversity and
   different species from those on the ice, with the exception of five
   species that occurred in both habitats. This loss of glacial ice in the
   Arctic is therefore resulting in the loss of habitats for cold-dwelling
   fungal species. Fungal diversity is a potentially rich biological
   resource of glacial ecosystems, with unique taxa. The rapid loss of
   these glacial habitats underscores the urgency for genomic surveys of
   fungal diversity in the High Arctic, and the need for further isolation
   of strains as well as cryopreservation of environmental micro-biome
   samples for future research and conservation.},

Abstract = {The composition of the terrestrial Antarctic flora and fauna and the
   distribution patterns of a number of species and of the principal
   vegetation types is now reasonably well established, at least in
   outline, for the Antarctic Peninsula region and the areas about McMurdo
   Sound as well as for some areas around the coastal ranges of East
   Antarctica. Detailed research at Signy Island has provided information
   concerning thebiomass and productivity of certain vegetation types,
   decomposer organisms, microbivores, and invertebrate herbivores and
   predators. The main pathways of energy and nutrient within the
   terrestrial study sites can be regarded as reasonably established. Net
   annual production locally reaches very high levels (up to 800 g m-2).
   Only a tiny part of this productivity is consumed by herbivores, the
   greater part passing to the decomposers or persisting as peat. Most of
   the animals are microbivores, or graze on fungi, and in turn sustain the
   small number of invertebrate predators. Analysis of the range of
   habitats even on Signy Island indicates however that the sites for which
   detailed ecological information is available represent only a part of
   the range of environmental and ecological variation. The island is
   characterized by a very high level of within-site diversity, some of it
   on a very small scale. Similarly, recent research which permits
   ecological comparisons with the Subantarctic islands of South Georgia
   and Macquarie, and with the McMurdo area, confirms that Signy Island
   displays only a small part of the very large range of diversity within
   the antarctic regions as a whole. It is a reasonably representative
   sample of the Maritime Antarctic zone in the Antarctic Peninsula region
   where conditions are particularly favorable for terrestrial life. Its
   ecological features resemble most closely those of the South Shetland
   Islands (except over permeable volcanic rocks) and the Palmer
   Archipelago on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. Very
   different plant and animal communities occur over much of the McMurdo
   Sound region and in the inland ranges of East Antarctica. Some general
   statements can now be made about the relationships between terrestrial
   antarctic eco-systems and climatic, edaphic and historical factors.
   There is a clearly marked attenuation of the vegetation and fauna and
   simplification of the ecological systems as one moves towards cold, arid
   continental conditions. But the biota of the Maritime Antarctic and the
   Subantarctic islands is more impoverished than ecological factors alone
   would indicate because of the isolation of these land habitats, many of
   which have only recently been deglaciated. If present environmental
   conditions persist, a slow increase in the complexity of these
   ecological systems is to be expected and in some areas, especially the
   subantarctic islands, this process is being accelerated by human
   influence.},

Abstract = {Despite low temperatures, poor nutrient levels and high pressure,
   microorganisms thrive in deep-sea environments of polar regions. The
   adaptability to such extreme environments renders deep-sea
   microorganisms an encouraging source of novel, bioactive secondary
   metabolites. In this study, we isolated 77 microorganisms collected by a
   remotely operated vehicle from the seafloor in the Fram Strait, Arctic
   Ocean (depth of 2454 m). Thirty-two bacteria and six fungal strains that
   represented the phylogenetic diversity of the isolates were cultured
   using an One-Strain-Many-Compounds (OSMAC) approach. The crude EtOAc
   extracts were tested for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. While
   antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium was common for many isolates,
   only two bacteria displayed anticancer activity, and two fungi inhibited
   the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Due to bioactivity against C.
   albicans and rich chemical diversity based on molecular network-based
   untargeted metabolomics, Aspergillus versicolor PS108-62 was selected
   for an in-depth chemical investigation. A chemical work-up of the
   SPE-fractions of its dichloromethane subextract led to the isolation of
   a new PKS-NRPS hybrid macrolactone, versicolide A (1), a new quinazoline
   (-)-isoversicomide A (3), as well as three known compounds, burnettramic
   acid A (2), cyclopenol (4) and cyclopenin (5). Their structures were
   elucidated by a combination of HRMS, NMR, {[}alpha](D), FT-IR
   spectroscopy and computational approaches. Due to the low amounts
   obtained, only compounds 2 and 4 could be tested for bioactivity, with 2
   inhibiting the growth of C. albicans (IC50 7.2 mu g/mL). These findings
   highlight, on the one hand, the vast potential of the genus Aspergillus
   to produce novel chemistry, particularly from underexplored ecological
   niches such as the Arctic deep sea, and on the other, the importance of
   untargeted metabolomics for selection of marine extracts for downstream
   chemical investigations.},

Abstract = {Acid phosphatase production by 12 Hebeloma strains was usually
   derepressed when inorganic phosphorus in the growth medium was limited,
   but appeared to be constitutive in some strains. At low
   temperatures(less than or equal to 12 degrees) arctic strains produced
   more extracellular and wall-bound acid phosphatase, yet grew more slowly
   than the temperate strains. We suggest that low growth rates in arctic
   strains may be a physiological response to cold whereby resources are
   diverted into carbohydrate accumulation for cryoprotection. At near
   freezing temperatures, increased extracellular phosphatase production
   may compensate for a loss of enzyme activity at low temperature and
   serve to hydrolyse organic phosphorus in frozen soil over winter.},

Abstract = {The chemical and microbiological properties of urban soils (Urbic
   Technosols) of Murmansk (Russia) are compared with those in podzols
   (Albic Podzols) of the background area. Urban soils display increased pH
   values and higher contents of major biogenic elements: C, N, P, and K,
   especially pronounced in subsoil horizons. In the urban topsoils, the
   number of cultured bacteria are increased (saprotrophs, to 3-6 x 10(6)
   CFU/g and oligotrophs, to 4.5-8 x 10(6) CFU/g), whereas the number of
   cultured microscopic fungi are decreased by two orders of magnitude (to
   10(3) CFU) as compared with native podzols. As for the urban subsoil
   horizons, the number of all groups of microorganisms are increased as
   compared with the background. The diversity of micromycete complexes in
   urban soils follows the same pattern. Spatial nonuniformity of the
   species composition and structure of microfungal complexes is observed
   in the urban topsoils versus the subsoils, which display a relative
   uniformity of the dominant species composition (Trichocladium griseum,
   relative abundance of 41-77\%). The share and abundance of BSL-1 and
   BSL-2 opportunistic micromycetes increase in the urban topsoils to
   50-60\% versus native podzols with the share of 30\%. The degree of
   mycological hazard in urban soils varies from dangerous to safe (index
   of mycological hazard Im values are from 7-20 in the city center to
   1.5-3.6 in the suburbs). The results demonstrate that urbanization in
   the Arctic not only changes the chemical properties of soils but also
   creates a new niche for microorganisms in subsoil horizons.},

Abstract = {Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi differ in their abilities to use nitrogen
   sources and may be integral to maintaining fungal and plant diversity in
   ecosystems in which Ericaceae occur. In this study, we tested whether
   the fungal communities differ among three species of co-occurring
   Ericaceae.
   Fungi colonizing Cassiope tetragona, Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium
   vitisidaea roots in the Arctic tundra were characterized via
   culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The cultured fungi
   were tested for their ability to colonize Vaccinium uliginosum in
   laboratory-based assays.
   The pure-cultured Helotiales were grouped into eight clades and
   dominated by the Phialocephala-Acephala complex. Representatives of
   these clades, plus an unknown basidiomycete with affinity to the genus
   Irpex (Polyporales), colonized V. uliginosum intracellularly. The
   Helotiales detected by direct PCR, cloning and sequencing were assigned
   to 14 clades and dominated by members of the Rhizoscyphus ericae
   complex. Ordination analyses indicated that culture-dependent and
   culture-independent assays provided distinct views of root fungal
   communities, but no evidence for host specificity.
   These data suggest that ericaceous roots host diverse fungal communities
   dominated by the Helotiales. However, these fungal communities are
   unlikely to be controlled by fungal host preferences. The mechanisms
   maintaining high diversity in root-symbiotic communities remain to be
   elucidated.},

Abstract = {Harsh and extreme environments, such as Antarctica, offer unique
   opportunities to explore new microbial taxa and biomolecules. Given the
   limited knowledge on microbial diversity, this study aimed to compile,
   analyze and compare a subset of the biobank of Antarctic fungi
   maintained at the UNESP's Central of Microbial Resources (CRM-UNESP). A
   total of 711 isolates (240 yeasts and 471 filamentous fungi) from marine
   and terrestrial samples collected at King George Island (South Shetland
   Islands, Antarctica) were used with the primary objective of
   investigating their presence in both marine and terrestrial
   environments. Among the yeasts, 13 genera were found, predominantly
   belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. Among the filamentous fungi, 34
   genera were represented, predominantly from the phylum Ascomycota. The
   most abundant genera in the marine samples were Metschnikowia, Mrakia,
   and Pseudogymnoascus, while in the terrestrial samples, they were
   Pseudogymnoascus, Leucosporidium, and Mortierella. Most of the genera
   and species of the CRM-UNESP biobank of Antarctic fungi are being
   reported as an important target for biotechnological applications. This
   study showed the relevance of the CRM-UNESP biobank, highlighting the
   importance of applying standard methods for the preservation of the
   biological material and associated data (BMaD), as recommended in
   national and international standards.},

Abstract = {Previous studies of fungi in polar environments have revealed a
   prevalence of basidiomycetous yeasts in soil and in subglacial
   environments of polythermal glaciers. Ascomycetous yeasts have rarely
   been reported from extremely cold natural environments, even though they
   are known contaminants of frozen foods. Using media with low water
   activity, we have isolated various yeast species from the subglacial ice
   of four glaciers from the coastal Arctic environment of Kongsfjorden,
   Spitzbergen, including Debaryomyces hansenii and Pichia guillermondii,
   with counts reaching 10(4) CFU L-1. Together with the basidiomycetes
   Cryptococcus liquefaciens and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, these yeasts
   represent the stable core of the subglacial yeast communities. Other
   glacial ascomycetous species isolated included Candida parapsilosis and
   a putative new species that resembles Candida pseudorugosa. The
   archiascomycete Protomyces inouyei has seldom been detected anywhere in
   the world but was here recovered from ice in a glacier cave. The glacier
   meltwater contained only D. hansenii, whereas the seawater contained D.
   hansenii, Debaryomyces maramus, Pichia guilliermondii, what appears to
   represent a novel species resembling Candida galli and Metschnikowia
   bicuspidata. Only P. guilliermondii was isolated from sea ice, while
   snow/ice in the fjord tidal zone included C. parapsilosis, D. hansenii,
   P. guilliermondii and Metschnikowia zobellii. All of these isolated
   strains were characterized as psychrotolerant and xero/halotolerant,
   with the exception of P. inouyei.},

Abstract = {Microbial adaptations to extreme environments can lead to
   biotechnological applications. This study aimed to evaluate the
   resistance of Antarctic Cladosporium to adverse conditions (temperature,
   salinity, UV radiation, and nutrients) and refine their taxonomy.
   Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis using ITS- act markers resulted in
   a more accurate taxonomic identification, revealing the presence of five
   different species, belonging to the complexes C. cladosporioides and C.
   sphaerospermum. . The growth at different temperatures indicates that
   the soil isolates LAMAI 564 and 1800 (phylogenetically closely related)
   and LAMAI 2541 are psychrophilic, while the other isolates are
   psychrotolerant. The fungi isolated from the saline samples LAMAI 595,
   616, and 1369 showed better growth results at higher salinity (15\%).
   The fungi most resistant to UV radiation were isolated from terrestrial
   and marine samples (LAMAI 595, 616, 1800, and 564). LAMAI 595 and 616
   (phylogenetically closely related and isolated from the same kind of
   sample) showed the capacity of nutritional versatility, growing well in
   both rich and poor-nutrient media. The fungus LAMAI 595 was the most
   promising for biotechnological application, exceeding the other isolates
   in the harsh conditions studied. The resistance of the Antarctic
   Cladosporium to adverse conditions opens new perspectives in the field
   of applied microbiology of extremophiles.},

Title = {Diversity and distribution of lichen-associated fungi in the Ny-Alesund

Abstract = {This study assessed the diversity and distribution of fungal communities
   associated with seven lichen species in the Ny-Alesund Region (Svalbard,
   High Arctic) using Roche 454 pyrosequencing with fungal-specific primers
   targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal
   rRNA gene. Lichen-associated fungal communities showed high diversity,
   with a total of 42,259 reads belonging to 370 operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs) being found. Of these OTUs, 294 belonged to Ascomycota, 54
   to Basidiomycota, 2 to Zygomycota, and 20 to unknown fungi.
   Leotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes were the major
   classes, whereas the dominant orders were Helotiales, Capnodiales, and
   Chaetothyriales. Interestingly, most fungal OTUs were closely related to
   fungi from various habitats (e.g., soil, rock, plant tissues) in the
   Arctic, Antarctic and alpine regions, which suggests that living in
   association with lichen thalli may be a transient stage of life cycle
   for these fungi and that long-distance dispersal may be important to the
   fungi in the Arctic. In addition, host-related factors shaped the
   lichen-associated fungal communities in this region. Taken together,
   these results suggest that lichens thalli act as reservoirs of diverse
   fungi from various niches, which may improve our understanding of fungal
   evolution and ecology in the Arctic.},

Title = {Application of lipid biomarker analysis to evaluate the function of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC MS) and bulk carbon isotope
   determinations have been performed on samples ('cemented organic
   residues', charcoal, sediment and fire-cracked rock) excavated from 12
   slab-lined pits from various locations in Arctic Norway to test the
   premise that these archaeological features were used for the extraction
   of oil from the blubber of marine mammals, such as seal, whale and
   walrus. A wide range of lipid compound classes were detected especially
   in the cemented organic residues and in the charcoal samples. The
   presence of long-chain unsaturated and isoprenoid fatty acids together
   with oxidation and thermal alteration products of unsaturated acids such
   as dicarboxylic acids, dihydroxyfatty acids and
   omega-(o-alkylphenyl)alkanoic acids suggests that these features were
   used for marine oil extraction at elevated temperatures. Notably the
   location of the hydroxyl groups in the dihydroxyfatty acids provides a
   record of the positional isomer of the precursor fatty acid and allows
   confirmation that 11-docosenoic (cetoleic) acid, the most abundant
   C-22:1 isomer in marine oil, was a major component of the original
   lipid. Further information was provided by the presence of long-chain
   fatty acyl moieties in surviving triacylglycerols and the presence of
   cholesterol. A fungal metabolite, mycose (trehalose), was found in all
   samples apart from a fire-cracked rock and points to microbiological
   activity in the pits. Bulk isotope analysis conducted on the `cemented
   organic residues' is consistent with modern reference samples of blubber
   and oil from seal and whale. These data provide clear analytical
   evidence of the function of slab-lined pits in the archaeological record
   and suggest widespread exploitation of marine mammals for producing oil
   for heating, lighting and myriad other uses in the past. (C) 2010

Abstract = {A novel Gram-stain-negative bacterium, strain CY03(T), was isolated from
   sediment of the Yellow Sea, PR China. Cells of strain CY03(T) were rods,
   aerobic and non-flagellated. Growth occurred at 5-40 degrees C (optimum,
   30 degrees C), pH 5.5-9.5 (pH 7.5) and with 0.5-9.0 \% NaCl (1.5-2.0
   \%). The 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison showed affiliation to the
   family Rhodobacteraceae with Puniceibacterium confluentis (97.0 \%) as
   the most closely related species, followed by members of the genus
   Pseudooceanicola, Pseudooceanicola antarcticus (96.8 \%) and
   Pseudooceanicola nitratireducens (96.7 \%). The major cellular fatty
   acids were cyclo-C-19:0 omega 8c, C-16:0, summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega
   7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c) and 11-methyl C-18:1 omega 7c. The polar
   lipids consisted of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, one
   unidentified phospholipid, one unidentified aminolipid and five
   unidentified lipids. The predominant respiratory quinone was Q-10. The
   DNA G+C content of the type strain was 62.8 mol\%. Based on the results
   of the polyphasic characterization for strain CY03(T), it represents a
   novel species of a novel genus of the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which
   the name Pseudopuniceibacterium sediminis gen. nov., sp. nov. is
   proposed. The type strain is CY03(T )(=CCTCC AB 2017195(T)=KCTC

Abstract = {Penicillium species are common fungi found worldwide from diverse
   substrates, including soil, plant debris, food products and air. Their
   diversity in aquatic environments is still underexplored. With the aim
   to explore the fungal diversity in Spanish freshwater sediments,
   numerous Penicillium strains were isolated using various
   culture-dependent techniques. A preliminary sequence analysis of the
   beta-tubulin (tub2) gene marker allowed us to identify several
   interesting species of Penicillium, which were later characterized
   phylogenetically with the barcodes recommended for species delimitation
   in the genus. Based on the multi-locus phylogeny of the internal
   transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA, and partial
   fragments of tub2, calmodulin (cmdA), and the RNA polymerase II largest
   subunit (rpb2) genes, in combination with phenotypic analyses, five
   novel species are described. These are P. ausonanum in section
   Lanata-Divaricata, P. guarroi in sect. Gracilenta, P. irregulare in
   sect. Canescentia, P. sicoris in sect. Paradoxa and P. submersum in
   sect. Robsamsonia. The study of several isolates from samples collected
   in different locations resulted in the reinstatement of P. vaccaeorum
   into section Citrina. Finally, P. heteromorphum (sect. Exilicaulis) and
   P. tardochrysogenum (sect. Chrysogena) are reported, previously only
   known from Antarctica and China, respectively.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric sounding using the Tu-134 Optik aircraft-laboratory was
   conducted in September 2020 over the seas of the Russian sector of the
   Arctic Ocean, namely the Barents, Kara, Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi
   and Bering seas. Unique samples of atmospheric aerosols at altitudes
   from 200 and up to 10,000 m were taken, including samples for the
   identification of cultivated microorganisms and their genetic analysis.
   Data on the concentration and diversity of bacteria and fungi isolated
   from 24 samples of atmospheric aerosols are presented; the main
   phenotypic and genomic characteristics were obtained for 152 bacterial
   cultures; and taxonomic belonging was determined. The concentration of
   cultured microorganisms detected in aerosols of different locations was
   similar, averaging 5.5 x 103 CFU/m3. No dependence of the number of
   isolated microorganisms on the height and location of aerosol sampling
   was observed. The presence of pathogenic and condto shitionally
   pathogenic bacteria, including those referred to in the genera
   Staphylococcus, Kocuria, Rothia, Comamonas, Brevundimonas,
   Acinetobacter, and others, as well as fungi represented by the widely
   spread genera Aureobasidium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Penicillium,
   capable of causing infectious and allergic diseases were present in most
   analyzed samples. Obtained data reveal the necessity of systematic
   studies of atmospheric microbiota composition to combat emerging
   population diseases.},

Abstract = {PLANT growth in arctic tundra is strongly nitrogen-limited despite large
   pools of soil organic nitrogen1-4. Here we report that field-collected
   roots of Eriophorum vaginatum, an arctic sedge, rapidly absorb free
   amino acids, accounting for at least 60\% of the nitrogen absorbed by
   this species in the field. In solution culture, Eriophorum accumulates
   more nitrogen and biomass when supplied with amino acids than when grown
   on inorganic nitrogen, whereas Hordeum vulgare (a cereal adapted to
   mineral soils) grows least when nitrogen is supplied as amino acids. To
   our knowledge, this is the first documentation of preferential
   absorption and use of organic nitrogen by a non-mycorrhizal vascular
   plant. The direct absorption of amino acids by Eriophorum short-circuits
   the bottle-neck in arctic nitrogen cycles imposd by temperature-limited
   mineralization.},

Abstract = {We recovered 195 fungal isolates from the sediments of different lakes
   in the Antarctic Peninsula, which were screened to detect bioactive
   compounds. Forty-two taxa belonging to the phyla Ascomycota,
   Basidiomycota, and Mortierellomycota were identified. Thelebolus
   globosus, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus,
   Vishniacozyma victoriae, and Phenoliferia sp. were found to be the most
   prevalent. The fungal assemblages showed high diversity and richness,
   but low dominance values. However, the diversity indices and fungal
   distribution ranged according to the different lake sediments. Sixty
   fungal extracts displayed at least one biological activity against the
   evaluated targets. Among them, Pseudogymnoascus destructans showed
   selective trypanocidal activity, Cladosporium sp. 1 and Trichoderma
   polysporum showed antifungal activity, and Pseudogymnoascus
   appendiculatus and Helotiales sp. showed high herbicidal activity. We
   detected a rich and diverse fungal community composed of cold
   cosmopolitan and psychrophilic endemic taxa recognized as decomposers,
   symbiotics, pathogens, and potential new species, in the sediments of
   Antarctic lakes. The dynamics and balance of this fungal community
   represents an interesting aquatic web model for further ecological and
   evolutionary studies under extreme conditions and potential climate
   changes in the regions. In addition, we detected fungal taxa and
   isolates able to produce bioactive compounds that may represent the
   source of prototype molecules for applications in medicine and
   agriculture. (C) 2020 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {High amounts of driftwood sail across the oceans and provide habitat for
   organisms tolerating the rough and saline environment. Fungi have
   adapted to the extremely cold and saline conditions which driftwood
   faces in the high north. For the first time, we applied high-throughput
   sequencing to fungi residing in driftwood to reveal their taxonomic
   richness, community composition, and ecology in the North Atlantic.
   Using pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons obtained from 49 marine logs, we
   found 807 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustering
   at 97 \% sequence similarity cut-off level. The phylum Ascomycota
   comprised 74 \% of the OTUs and 20 \% belonged to Basidiomycota. The
   richness of basidiomycetes decreased with prolonged submersion in the
   sea, supporting the general view of ascomycetes being more
   extremotolerant. However, more than one fourth of the fungal OTUs
   remained unassigned to any fungal class, emphasising the need for better
   DNA reference data from the marine habitat. Different fungal communities
   were detected in coniferous and deciduous logs. Our results highlight
   that driftwood hosts a considerably higher fungal diversity than
   currently known. The driftwood fungal community is not a terrestrial
   relic but a speciose assemblage of fungi adapted to the stressful marine
   environment and different kinds of wooden substrates found in it.},

Abstract = {We studied the culturable fungal community recovered from deep marine
   sediments in the maritime Antarctic, and assessed their capabilities to
   produce exoenzymes, emulsifiers and metabolites with phytotoxic
   activity. Sixty-eight Ascomycota fungal isolates were recovered and
   identified. The most abundant taxon recovered was the yeast Meyerozyma
   guilliermondii, followed by the filamentous fungi Penicillium
   chrysogenum, P. cf. palitans, Pseudeurotium cf. bakeri, Thelebolus
   balaustiformis, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and Cladosporium sp.
   Diversity indices displayed low values overall, with the highest values
   obtained at shallow depth, decreasing to the deepest location sampled.
   Only M. guilliermondii and P. cf. palitans were detected in the
   sediments at all depths sampled, and were the most abundant taxa at all
   sample sites. The most abundant enzymes detected were proteases,
   followed by invertases, cellulases, lipases, carrageenases, agarases,
   pectinases and esterases. Four isolates showed good biosurfactant
   activity, particularly the endemic species A. psychrotrophicus.
   Twenty-four isolates of P. cf. palitans displayed strong phytotoxic
   activities against the models Lactuca sativa and Allium schoenoprasum.
   The cultivable fungi recovered demonstrated good biosynthetic activity
   in the production of hydrolytic exoenzymes, biosurfactant molecules and
   metabolites with phytotoxic activity, reinforcing the importance of
   documenting the taxonomic, ecological and biotechnological properties of
   fungi present in deep oceanic sediments of the Southern Ocean.},

Title = {Competition for resources is ameliorated by niche differentiation

Abstract = {Aims
   Competition has been shown to modify the niche breadth of coexisting
   species, but within-species interactions have received little attention.
   Establishing small juvenile individuals and established, larger,
   sexually reproducing adult individuals represent two life-history stages
   within species. We investigated the nitrogen and carbon resource use of
   adult and juvenile individuals and similarity of symbiotic fungal
   community composition in these two plant life stages. We used the plant
   Solidago virgaurea growing in a simplified system in the low Arctic as
   model species.
   Methods
   Isotopic signatures (foliar delta N-15 and foliar delta C-13) were
   analysed to characterize nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency
   of the plants. Symbiotic root fungal community composition was estimated
   by cloning and sequencing small subunit ribosomal RNA gene.
   Important Findings
   The isotopic signatures differed significantly between the life stages,
   indicating that the establishing juvenile cohort used relatively more
   amino acids or gained N through mycorrhizal symbiosis in comparison to
   the established adult plants. Symbiotic fungal communities did not
   differ between the two plant cohorts suggesting a possibility that the
   plants shared the same mycorrhizal network. We conclude that
   competition-mediated differences in plant resource use may create niche
   differentiation between the two life-history stages and enable them to
   coexist.},

Title = {ROCK VARNISH IN THE SONORAN DESERT - MICROBIOLOGICALLY MEDIATED
   ACCUMULATION OF MANGANIFEROUS SEDIMENTS},
Journal = {SEDIMENTOLOGY},

Abstract = {Rock varnish occurs in virtually all environments, most commonly in arid
   and semi-arid climates, including Antarctica.  Rock varnish consists of
   thin layers of intimately mixed aeolian and chemical sediments often
   showing botryoidal and more rarely stromatolite-like morphologies. 
   Typical rock varnish samples collected at Twin Peak Mountain Park, near
   Phoenix, Arizona, consist of abundant quartz, with plagioclase, illite
   and a mixed layer, Fe-clay mineral, probably corrensite.  EDS, SEM (BSE)
   and TEM analyses revealed that the typical Mn, Fe minerals occur as
   minute particles; some of these particles and other mineral grains are
   attached to filaments.  XRD and electron diffraction showed that the
   Mn,Fe-bearing particles are poorly crystalline.  The filaments, based on
   morphological criteria, are virtually indistinguishable from fungal
   filaments.  Most filaments are fragments, probably broken by scraping
   during sample collection.  Coccoid and rod-shaped forms, resembling
   cyanobacteria and other bacteria, respectively, are also present. 
   Unlike definitive minerals, these filaments disintegrated in the
   concentrated energy of the SEM electron beam at the instrumental and
   experimental conditions used.  In addition, no filamentous, rod-shaped
   or coccoid forms were observed in samples hydrolysed with 6 N HCl for 24
   h at 100-degrees-C.  Bacteria and fungi in powdered rock varnish were
   cultured on four media, incubated aerobically in the dark at
   25-degrees-C.  The culture media yielded dense growths of spore-forming
   bacteria and filamentous fungi.  One fungus and two Bacillus isolates
   oxidized and concentrated manganese.  Control experiments revealed that
   fungi and bacteria are present on and below the surfaces of rock
   varnish.  Free and hydrolysed, peptide/protein-bound amino acids were
   identified in the rock varnish.  Amino acids showed virtually no
   racemization with the exception of D/L asp = 0.1.  Relatively high
   molecular weight humic matter was also separated from the rock varnish. 
   High-resolution mass spectrometry revealed non-hydrocarbon moieties,
   similar to a Suwannee River (FL) humic acid standard.  Micro-organisms
   and their original biochemical compounds do not seem to be preserved for
   long in the accreting varnish layer.  The studies showed that the
   filaments helped to trap mineral particles of rock varnish, and that
   bacteria and fungi abetted Mn concentration.  Some structures in the
   layers of rock varnish resemble stromatolites and present definitions
   would allow them to be termed as such.},

Abstract = {The 318m thick lacustrine sediment record from Lake El'gygytgyn,
   northeastern Russian Arctic cored by the international El'gygytgyn
   Drilling Project provides unique opportunities for the time-continuous
   reconstruction of the regional paleoenvironmental history for the past
   3.6 Myr. Pollen studies of the lower 216 m of the lacustrine sediments
   demonstrate their value as an excellent archive of vegetation and
   climate changes during the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. About
   3.5-3.35 Myr BP, the vegetation at Lake El'gygytgyn, now an area of
   tundra was dominated by spruce-larch-fir-hemlock forests. After ca. 3.35
   Myr BP dark coniferous taxa gradually disappeared. A very pronounced
   environmental change took place ca. 3.31-3.28 Myr BP, corresponding to
   the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2, when treeless tundra-and steppe-like
   habitats became dominant in the regional vegetation. Climate conditions
   were similar to those of Late Pleistocene cold intervals. Numerous
   coprophilous fungi spores identified in the pollen samples suggest the
   presence of grazing animals around the lake. Following the MIS M2 event,
   larch-pine forests with some spruce mostly dominated the area until ca.
   2.6 Myr BP, interrupted by colder and drier intervals ca. 3.043-3.025,
   2.935-2.912, and 2.719-2.698 Myr BP. At the beginning of the
   Pleistocene, ca. 2.6 Myr BP, noticeable climatic deterioration occurred.
   Forested habitats changed to predominantly treeless and shrubby
   environments, which reflect a relatively cold and dry climate. Peaks in
   observed green algae colonies (Botryococcus) around 2.53, 2.45,
   2.32-2.305, 2.20 and 2.16-2.15 Myr BP suggest a spread of shallow water
   environments. A few intervals (i.e., 2.55-2.53, ca. 2.37, and 2.35-2.32
   Myr BP) with a higher presence of coniferous taxa (mostly pine and
   larch) document some relatively short-term climate ameliorations during
   Early Pleistocene glacial periods.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a common
   pathogen in domestic ruminants that causes granulomatous inflammation of
   the small intestine leading to emaciation and wasting. Clinical disease
   (Johne's disease) is also reported for several wild ruminant species.
   Between 2007 and 2009 we collected 561 fecal samples from caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus ssp.) representing 10 herds of migratory caribou, two
   herds of caribou from Greenland, and three populations of boreal
   woodland caribou. Feces were tested for MAP by bacterial culture and PCR
   targeting the IS900 insertion sequence. In total, 31 samples from eight
   different populations representing all three ecotypes were found
   positive for MAP by PCR, with one sample from the Riviere-aux-Feuilles
   herd also being culture positive for the type II (cattle) strain. The
   proportion of positive animals was particularly high in the
   Akia-Maniitsoq herd in Greenland, and Riviere-aux-Feuilles and
   Riviere-George herds in northeastern Canada (2:3.4, 11..5, and 10.0\%,
   respectively). Our results indicate that MAP is present in several
   caribou herds of different ecotypes in northern Canada and Greenland and
   that MAP circulates within wildlife populations that do not have ongoing
   contact with domestic livestock. The epidemiology, pathogenicity, and
   effects on the health of caribou in northern ecosystems remain unknown.},

Abstract = {The Deception Island, located in Maritime Antarctica, is a volcanic
   island with geothermal activity and one of the most visited by tourists.
   However, the extent of the anthropogenic impact remains largely unknown
   and the factors shaping the resistance/tolerance mechanisms in the
   microbiomes from Whalers Bay ecosystems have never been investigated. In
   this context, this study aimed to reveal the resistome profiles of
   Whalers Bay sediments and correlate them with environmental factors.
   Samples were collected at four sites during the summer 2014/2015 along a
   transect of 27.5 m in the Whalers Bay sediments. DNA isolated from
   sediment samples was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform.
   Bioinformatic analyses allowed the assembly of contigs and scaffolds,
   prediction of ORFs, and taxonomic and functional annotation using NCBI
   RefSeq database and KEGG orthology, respectively. Microorganisms
   belonging to the genera Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium and Polaromonas
   were shown to dominate all sites, representing 60\% of taxonomic
   annotation. Arsenic (As), copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) were the most
   abundant metal resistance/tolerance types found in the microbiomes.
   Beta-lactam was the most common class related to antibiotics
   resistance/tolerance, corroborating with previous environmental
   resistome studies. The acridine class was the most abundant amongst the
   biocide resistance/tolerances, related to antiseptic compounds. Results
   gathered in this study reveal a repertoire of resistance/tolerance
   classes to antibiotics and biocides unusually found in Antarctica.
   However, given the volcanic nature (heavy metals-rich region) of
   Deception Island soils, this putative impact must be viewed with
   caution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A total of 71 isolates were collected from lake sediment and soil
   surrounding lakes in the Skarvsnes area, Antarctica. Based on ITS region
   sequence similarity, these isolates were classified to 10 genera.
   Twenty-three isolates were categorized as ascomycetous fungi from five
   genera (Embellisia, Phoma, Geomyces, Tetracladium or Thelebolus) and 48
   isolates were categorized as basidiomycetous fungi in five genera
   (Mrakia, Cryptococcus, Dioszegia, Rhodotorula or Leucosporidium).
   Thirty-five percent of culturable fungi were of the genus Mrakia.
   Eighteen isolates from eight genera were selected and tested for both
   antifreeze activity and capacity for growth under temperatures ranging
   from -1 to 25 degrees C. Rhodotorula sp. NHT-2 possessed a high degree
   of sequence homology with R.gracialis, while Leucosporidium sp. BSS-1
   possessed a high degree of sequence homology with Leu.antarcticum
   (Glaciozyma antarctica), and these two isolates demonstrated antifreeze
   activity. All isolates examined were capable of growth at -1 degrees C.
   Mrakia spp., while capable of growth at -1 degrees C, did not
   demonstrate any antifreeze activity and exhibited only limited secretion
   of extracellular polysaccharides. Species of the genus Mrakia possessed
   high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that members of this
   genus have adapted to cold environments by increasing their membrane
   fluidity.},

   (mycophenolic acid and citreoviridin), terpenes (andrastins A and B and
   phomenone), and N-acetyltriptamine. Most strains of the Penicillium
   subgenus isolated from anthropogenically impaired upper layers of
   Antarctic deposits and from subsurface Arctic deposits exhibited more
   complete spectra of secondary metabolites compared to three strains
   isolated from permafrost 15000 to 600000 years old. This is the first
   report on andrastins formation by a P. restrictum. Wide occurrence of
   rugulovasins in P. variabile strains was shown.},

Title = {INHIBITION OF GROWTH, AND EFFECTS ON NUTRIENT-UPTAKE OF ARCTIC
   GRAMINOIDS BY LEAF EXTRACTS - ALLELOPATHY OR RESOURCE COMPETITION
   BETWEEN PLANTS AND MICROBES},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},

Volume = {103},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that plant extracts, e.g. from boreal dwarf
   shrubs and trees, can cause reduced growth of neighbouring plants: an
   effect known as allelopathy. To examine whether arctic and subarctic
   plants could also be affected by leaching of phytochemicals, we added
   extracts from the commonly occurring arctic dwarf shrubs Cassiope
   tetragona and Empetrum hermaphroditum, and from mountain birch, Betula
   pubescens ssp. tortuosa to three graminoid species, Carex bigelowii,
   Festuca vivipara and Luzula arcuata, grown in previously sterilized or
   non-sterilized arctic soils. The graminoids in non-sterilized soil grew
   more slowly than those in sterilized soil. Excised roots of the plants
   in non-sterilized soil had higher uptake rate of labelled P than those
   in sterilized soil, demonstrating larger nutrient deficiency. The
   difference in growth rate was probably caused by higher nutrient
   availability for plants in soils in which the microbial biomass was
   killed after soil sterilization. The dwarf shrub extracts contained low
   amounts of inorganic N and P and medium high amounts of carbohydrates.
   Betula extracts contained somewhat higher levels of N and much higher
   levels of P and carbohydrates. Addition of leaf extracts to the strongly
   nutrient limited graminoids in non-sterilized soil tended to reduce
   growth, whereas in the less nutrient Limited sterilized soil it caused
   strong growth decline. Furthermore, the N and P uptake by excised roots
   of plants grown in both types of soil was high if extracts from the
   dwarf shrubs (with low P and N concentrations) had been added, whereas
   the P uptake declined but the N uptake increased after addition of the
   P-rich Betula extract. In contrast to the adverse extract effects on
   plants, soil microbial respiration and soil fungal biomass (ergosterol)
   was generally stimulated, most strongly after addition of the Betula
   extract. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the reduced
   plant growth and the concomitant stimulation of microbial activity were
   caused by phytochemicals, we believe that this was more likely due to
   labile carbon in the extracts which stimulated microbial biomass and
   activity. As a result microbial uptake increased, thereby depleting the
   plant available pool of N and P, or, for the P-rich Betula extract,
   depleting soil in organic N alone, to the extent of reducing plant
   growth. This chain of events is supported by the negative correlation
   between plant growth and sugar content in the three added extracts, and
   the positive correlation between mi crobial activity, fungal biomass
   production and sugar content, and are known reactions when labile carbon
   is added to nutrient deficient soils.},

Abstract = {This study characterized cultivable fungi present in sediments obtained
   from Boeckella Lake, Hope Bay, in the north-east of the Antarctic
   Peninsula, and evaluated their production of enzymes and biosurfactants
   of potential industrial interest. A total of 116 fungal isolates were
   obtained, which were classified into 16 genera within the phyla
   Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota, in rank. The most
   abundant genera of filamentous fungi included Pseudogymnoascus,
   Pseudeurotium and Antarctomyces; for yeasts, Thelebolales and Naganishia
   taxa were dominant. Overall, the lake sediments exhibited high fungal
   diversity and moderate richness and dominance. The enzymes esterase,
   cellulase and protease were the most abundantly produced by these fungi.
   Ramgea cf. ozimecii, Holtermanniella wattica, Leucosporidium
   creatinivorum, Leucosporidium sp., Mrakia blollopis, Naganishia sp. and
   Phenoliferia sp. displayed enzymatic index > 2. Fourteen isolates of
   filamentous fungi demonstrated an Emulsification Index 24\% (EI24\%) >=
   50\%; among them, three isolates of A. psychrotrophicus showed an EI24\%
   > 80\%. Boeckella Lake itself is in the process of drying out due to the
   impact of regional climate change, and may be lost completely in
   approaching decades, therefore hosts a threatened community of
   cultivable fungi that produce important biomolecules with potential
   application in biotechnological processes.},

   three moss-rich surface samples, two in spring and one in summer (2011),
   are reported for C-supplemented (8,000 mu g glucose-C) and
   non-supplemented treatments in laboratory culture. Seven days after
   supplementation, fungal C-biomass in the glucose-treated and untreated
   samples were similar in the range of 5 to 11 mg g(-1) soil dry weight,
   the highest values in the summer samples. The bacterial C-biomass was
   the next highest in the range of 20 to 120 mu g g(-1) soil dry weight,
   followed by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (2 to 14 mu g g(-1) soil dry
   weight). The naked amoebae (0.13 to 0.94 mu g C g(-1) soil dry weight)
   and testate amoebae (2 to 20 ng C g(-1) soil dry weight) contributed the
   least C-biomass. All of the bacterial and protozoan treatments showed
   increased biomass with glucose supplementation. Based on size, and
   C-biomass estimates, the phagotrophic protozoa appear to be organized in
   a classical bacterial-based trophic hierarchy (i.e. bacteria -
   nanoflagellates - naked amoebae - testate amoebae, in ascending order).
   Correlations of the C-biomass of bacteria to each of the protozoa,
   provided further evidence of a trophic pyramid; bacteria vs.
   nanoflagellates (r = -0.986), indicating top-down control by predatory
   flagellates, bacteria vs. naked amoebae (r = -0.361) and bacteria vs.
   testate amoebae (r = -0.131), each of decreasing magnitude as would be
   predicted for higher level consumers. Estimates of bacterial predation
   indicated strong predatory pressures on bacteria by the protozoa,
   greater with C-supplementation compared to the non-supplemented
   treatments.},

Abstract = {Arctic and temperate strains of Hebeloma spp, were grown in axenic
   culture on glutamic acid, alanine, lysine and NH4+ as sole sources of
   nitrogen (N), with excess carbon (C) or deficient C (supplied as
   glucose). Their ability to utilize seed protein as a natural N source
   was also assessed. AU strains tested had the capacity to assimilate
   amino acids and generally utilized alanine and glutamic acid more
   readily than NH4+. Some strains were able to utilize amino C when
   starved of glucose C, and could mineralize amino-N to NH8-N. Arctic
   strains, in particular, appeared to be pre-adapted to the utilization of
   seed protein N and glutamic acid N, which is often liberated in high
   concentrations after soil freezing. The results are discussed in

Title = {Structure of Microbial Communities and Biological Activity in Tundra
   Soils of the Euro-Arctic Region (Rybachy Peninsula, Russia)},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {The relevance of the Arctic regions' study is rapidly increasing due to
   the sensitive response of fragile ecosystems to climate change and
   anthropogenic pressure. The microbiome is an important component that
   determines the soils' functioning and an indicator of changes occurring
   in ecosystems. Rybachy Peninsula is the northernmost part of the
   continental European Russia and is almost completely surrounded by
   Barents Sea water. For the first time, the microbial communities of the
   Entic Podzol, Albic Podzol, Rheic Histosol and Folic Histosol as well as
   anthropogenically disturbed soils (chemical pollution and human impact,
   growing crops) on the Rybachy Peninsula were characterized using plating
   and fluorescence microscopy methods, in parallel with the enzymatic
   activity of soils. The amount and structure of soil microbial biomass,
   such as the total biomass of fungi and prokaryote, the length and
   diameter of fungal and actinomycete mycelium, the proportion of spores
   and mycelium in the fungal biomass, the number of spores and prokaryotic
   cells, the proportion of small and large fungal spores and their
   morphology were determined. In the soils of the peninsula, the fungal
   biomass varied from 0.121 to 0.669 mg/g soil. The biomass of prokaryotes
   in soils ranged from 9.22 to 55.45 mu g/g of soil. Fungi predominated,
   the proportion of which in the total microbial biomass varied from 78.5
   to 97.7\%. The number of culturable microfungi ranged from 0.53 to 13.93
   x 10(3) CFU/g in the topsoil horizons, with a maximum in Entic Podzol
   and Albic Podzol soils and a minimum in anthropogenically disturbed
   soil. The number of culturable copiotrophic bacteria varied from 41.8 x
   10(3) cells/g in a cryogenic spot to 5551.3 x 10(3) cells /g in
   anthropogenically disturbed soils. The number of culturable oligotrophic
   bacteria ranged from 77.9 to 12,059.6 x 10(3) cells/g. Changes in
   natural soils because of anthropogenic impact and a change in vegetation
   types have led to a change in the structure of the community of soil
   microorganisms. Investigated tundra soils had high enzymatic activity in
   native and anthropogenic conditions. The beta-glucosidase and urease
   activity were comparable or even higher than in the soils of more
   southern natural zone, and the activity of dehydrogenase was 2-5 times
   lower. Thus, despite the subarctic climatic conditions, local soils have
   a significant biological activity upon which the productivity of
   ecosystems largely depends. The soils of the Rybachy Peninsula have a
   powerful enzyme pool due to the high adaptive potential of soil
   microorganisms to the extreme conditions of the Arctic, which allows
   them to perform their functions even under conditions of anthropogenic
   interference.},

Title = {Functionally explicit partitioning of plant β-diversity reveal soil
   fungal assembly in the subarctic tundra},
Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Metabarcoding technologies for soil fungal DNA pools have enabled to
   capture the diversity of fungal community and the agreement of their
   beta-diversity with plant beta-diversity. However, processes underlying
   the synchrony of the aboveground-belowground biodiversity is still
   unclear. By using partitioning methods for plant beta-diversity, this
   study explored the process driving synchrony in tundra ecosystems, in
   which drastic vegetation shifts are observed with climate warming. Our
   methods based on Baselga's partitioning enabled the division of plant
   beta-diversity into two phenomena and three functional components.
   Correlation of fungal beta-diversity with the components of plant
   beta-diversity showed that the spatial replacement of fungi was promoted
   by plant species turnover, in particular, plant species turnover with
   functional exchange. In addition, spatial variety of graminoid or forbs
   species, rather than shrubs, enhanced fungal beta-diversity. These
   results suggest the importance of small-scale factors such as
   plant-fungal interactions or local environments modified by plants for
   the fungal community assemblage. The process-based understanding of
   community dynamics of plants and fungi allows us to predict the ongoing
   shrub encroachment in the Arctic region, which could weaken the
   aboveground-belowground synchrony.},

Abstract = {Snow is the largest component of the cryosphere, with its cover and
   distribution rapidly decreasing over the last decade due to climate
   warming. It is imperative to characterize the snow (nival) microbial
   communities to better understand the role of microorganisms inhabiting
   these rapidly changing environments. Here, we investigated the core
   nival microbiome, the cultivable microbial members, and the microbial
   functional diversity of the remote Uapishka mountain range, a massif of
   alpine sub-arctic tundra and boreal forest. Snow samples were taken over
   a two-month interval along an altitude gradient with varying degree of
   anthropogenic traffic and vegetation cover. The core snow alpine
   tundra/boreal microbiome, which was present across all samples,
   constituted of Acetobacterales, Rhizobiales and Acidobacteriales
   bacterial orders, and of Mycosphaerellales and Lecanorales fungal
   orders, with the dominant fungal taxa being associated with lichens. The
   snow samples had low active functional diversity, with Richness values
   ranging from 0 to 19.5. The culture-based viable microbial enumeration
   ranged from 0 to 8.05 x 103 CFUs/mL. We isolated and whole-genome
   sequenced five microorganisms which included three fungi, one alga, and
   one potentially novel bacterium of the Lichenihabitans genus; all of
   which appear to be part of lichen-associated taxonomic clades.
   The snow microbial community of a remote and protected sub-arctic alpine
   tundra is characterized by a low functional diversity and is dominated
   by lichen-associated bacterial and fungal taxa.},

Abstract = {At a high arctic, polar semi-desert site (79 degrees N) in Svalbard,
   nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were added to the soil
   for 5 yr to simulate increases in decomposition and nutrient
   mineralization which may occur as a result of increases in soil
   temperature and soil moisture caused by environmental change. Abundance
   of decomposer fungal species, isolated from standing-dead leaves of
   Dryas octopetala, varied between fertilized and unfertilized plots.
   Fungal biodiversity, as indicated by the Brillouin index, was lower in
   dead Dryas leaves from the fertilized plots, although more colonies were
   isolated from leaves of plants which had been fertilized. The fungi were
   cosmopolitan and not restricted to tundra areas. The dead leaves from
   the fertilized plots contained more nitrogen and phosphorus than those
   of the unfertilized plants. Leaves in the fertilized plots appeared to
   have been killed by winter injury resulting from an extended growing
   season in an atypically mild and wet autumn, which was followed quickly
   by extreme subzero temperatures.},

   (measured as protein increase) in sand and a linear rate of extension on
   agar. Radial increase on agar was shown not to be a good index of growth
   in sand. Trends in growth rates in the sand cultures indicated that all
   4 fungi can grow at low temperatures. The growth rate for P.
   janthinellum at 15.degree. C was higher than at 20.degree. C, and
   Cylindrocarpon sp. and P. herbarum had higher growth rates at
   2.5.degree. C than at 5.degree. C. These data suggest that there may be
   some adaptation by these fungi to growth in Arctic regions.},

Title = {Metabolomic Profiling and Lipid Composition of Arctic and Antarctic

Abstract = {Adaptive reactions of Arctic and Antarctic strains of psychrophilic
   micromycetes Geomyces pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus to growth
   within a broad temperature range were studied. Adaptation of these
   species to different temperatures was found to result from both
   morphological and biochemical changes, including changes in the
   concentration of small molecules and lipid membrane components. These
   biochemical, morphological, and physiological mechanisms exhibited the
   patterns common to all strains, as well as species and strain
   differences. The general patterns included temperature-dependent changes
   in amounts of monosaccharides, some disaccharides, and free linoleic and
   linolenic acids. The differences between the Arctic and Antarctic
   strains were mainly associated with the differences in lipid
   composition, while interspecies differences resulted from metabolomic
   modifications. Antarctic strains showed lower ability to survive
   elevated temperatures, which correlated with weaker manifestation of the
   lipid-dependent adaptive mechanisms compared to the Arctic strains.
   Among the interstrain differences, higher growth parameters and mannitol
   accumulation were found in the Arctic isolates. Adaptation of T.
   microsporus was characterized by more diverse changes in the
   concentrations of small organic molecules in the metabolome profile and
   by pronounced changes in mycelial morphology. The results of metabolomic
   analysis and their subsequent treatment by the methods of multivariant
   statistics supported the suggestion of higher dispersion of metabolomic
   characteristics under unfavorable conditions and of lower dispersion of
   metabolomic data under optimal conditions.},

Title = {Antarctic nematodes survival in Martian and Lunar regolith simulants

Journal = {ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {96},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The exploration of extraterrestrial environments has become a focal
   point of scientific inquiry, driven by advancements in technology and a
   growing interest in the potential for life beyond Earth. This study
   investigates the adaptability of Antarctic nematodes, known for thriving
   in extreme cold and isolation, to simulated Martian (MGS-1) and Lunar
   (LMS-1) soils. The experiment revealed differential responses in
   nematode survivability to the two simulants, with Lunar soil
   demonstrating better adaptability compared to Martian soil. Our study
   provides valuable insights into the potential survivability of Antarctic
   nematodes on real Martian and Lunar substrates with the use of the MGS-1
   and the LMS-1 under terrestrial conditions. The observed results suggest
   differential survival responses to Lunar (6.92 +/- 0.74) and Martian
   (5.58 +/- 1.91) regolith simulants and highlight the complexity of
   factors influencing organismal survival. Considering their crucial role
   in soil food webs, and their relation with nutrient cycling and carbon
   dioxide emissions, the observed capacity of nematodes to thrive in
   Martian and Lunar regoliths positions them as potential candidates to
   sustain human habitats, helping on the development of in-situ resource
   utilization (ISRU) systems, and forming the basis for a biological
   life-support system to facilitate human survival in extraterrestrial
   environments.},

Abstract = {In arctic tundra soil N is highly limiting, N mineralization is slow and
   organic N greatly exceeds inorganic N. We studied the effects of
   fungistatics (azoxystrobin {[}Quadris (R)] or propiconazole {[}Tilt
   (R)]) on the fungi isolated from ericaceous plant roots in vitro. In
   addition to testing the phytotoxicity of the two fungistatics we also
   tested their effects on growth and nitrogen uptake of an ericaceous
   plant (Vaccinium uliginosum) in a closed Petri plate system without
   root-associated fungi. Finally, to evaluate the fungistatic effects in
   an in vivo experiment we applied fungistatics and nitrogen isotopes to
   intact tundra soil cores from Toolik Lake, Alaska, and examined the
   ammonium-N and glycine-N use by Vaccinium vitisidaea with and without
   fungistatics. The experiments on fungal pure cultures showed that Tilt
   was more effective in reducing fungal colony growth in vitro than
   Quadris (R), which was highly variable among the fungal strains.
   Laboratory experiments aiming to test the fungistatic effects on plant
   performance in vitro showed that. neither Quadris (R) nor Tilt (R)
   affected V uliginosum growth or N uptake. In this experiment V
   ufiginosum assimilated more than an order of magnitude more ammonium-N
   than glycine-N. The intact tundra core experiment provided contrasting
   results. After 10 wk of fungistatic application in the growth chamber V
   vitis-idaea leaf \%N was 10\% lower and the amount of leaf N-15 acquired
   was reduced from labeled ammonium (33\%) and glycine (40\%) during the 4
   d isotope treatment. In contrast to the in vitro experiment leaf N-15
   assimilation from glycine was three times higher than from (NH4)-N-15 in
   the treatments that received no-fungistatics. We conclude that the
   function of the fungal communities is essential to the acquisition of N
   from organic sources and speculate that N acquisition from inorganic
   sources is mainly inhibited by competition with complex soil microbial
   communities.},

Title = {A Cold-Adapted Chitinase-Producing Bacterium from Antarctica and Its
   Potential in Biocontrol of Plant Pathogenic Fungi},
Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {To obtain chitinase-producing microorganisms with high chitinolytic
   activity at low temperature, samples collected from Fildes Peninsula in
   Antarctica were used as sources for bioprospecting of chitinolytic
   microorganisms. A cold-adapted strain, designated as GWSMS-1, was
   isolated from marine sediment and further characterized as Pseudomonas.
   To improve the chitinase production, one-factor-at-a-time and orthogonal
   test approaches were adopted to optimize the medium components and
   culture conditions. The results showed that the highest chitinolytic
   activity (6.36 times higher than that before optimization) was obtained
   with 95.41 U L-1 with 15 g L-1 of glucose, 1 g L-1 of peptone, 15 g L-1
   of colloid chitin and 0.25 g L-1 of magnesium ions contained in the
   medium, cultivated under pH 7.0 and a temperature of 20 degrees C. To
   better understand the application potential of this strain, the
   enzymatic properties and the antifungal activity of the crude chitinase
   secreted by the strain were further investigated. The crude enzyme
   showed the maximum catalytic activity at 35 degrees C and pH 4.5, and it
   also exhibited excellent low-temperature activity, which still displayed
   more than 50\% of its maximal activity at 0 degrees C. Furthermore, the
   crude chitinase showed significant inhibition of fungi Verticillium
   dahlia CICC 2534 and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum CICC 2532,
   which can cause cotton wilt and cucumber blight, respectively,
   suggesting that strain GWSMS-1 could be a competitive candidate for
   biological control in agriculture, especially at low temperature.},

Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},

Volume = {99},

Abstract = {The discordant trend of plant and fungal beta-diversity suggested an
   ecological rule reflecting plant-fungal interaction.
   Beta-diversity partitioning has shown that the nestedness component is
   developed with environmental stress in a variety of taxa. However, soil
   fungal community may maintain its turnover components in contrast to the
   development of plants' nestedness component, and the potential causes
   remain unclear. To investigate the process of species turnover of soil
   fungi along a stress gradient in the Arctic, we divided species turnover
   component into sub-components: beta(sim\_hete) and beta(sim\_homo)
   representing species turnover with and without a change in the guilds,
   respectively. The results indicate that fungal communities maintain
   their turnover components, unlike plant communities; however, their
   beta(sim\_hete) increased under stressful conditions. Additionally, GDM
   analysis showed that beta(sim\_hete) was mainly explained by stress
   gradient and plant nestedness, suggesting that the functionality of soil
   fungi was ecologically filtered by environmental stress and plant
   community structure. The discordant trend of beta-diversity values
   between plant and fungi (i.e. development of plant nestedness and
   maintenance of fungal turnover) is possibly not caused by different
   assembly rules working in parallel on the two taxa, but according to an
   ecological rule that reflects plant-fungal interaction.},

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {41},
Number = {10},

Abstract = {The major part of the north polar region is intensely rising by
   postglacial crustal movement. This process gives rise to the separation
   of different basins from seas and oceans, which affects a combination of
   freshwater and marine organisms. Gradually losing contact with the seas,
   many near-shore lakes of the Arctic are mostly desalted and form bogs.
   Fungi as decomposers play an important role in all ecosystems. However,
   the diversity and role of fungi in Arctic aquatic ecosystems is largely
   unknown. It is also not clear how the taxonomic structure of the fungal
   community is affected by the process of gradual desalinization and
   waterlogging. We investigated the diversity of filamentous culturable
   fungi in different parts of the brackish Kislo-Sladkoe Lake (White Sea,
   Russia). Annually, 42 samples of the bottom and coastal soils have been
   collected at the lake from which fungi were recovered on standard and
   selective media. Based on morphological and molecular markers, a total
   of 127 taxa have been identified. The fungal community appeared to be
   influenced by its sea origin and comprised both marine
   (Paradendryphiella salina, Acremonium spp.) and terrestrial soil species
   of Penicillium, Talaromyces, Mucor, Umbelopsis, Cladosporium, Cadophora,
   Sistotrema, Helotiales, Pleosporales, sphagnum moss destructors
   (Oidiodendron spp.) and insect-associated species of Tolypocladium. The
   results indicate that the composition of the fungal community in the
   rising polar White Sea region reflects the dynamics of global changes in
   physical-chemical parameters and animal and plant associations because
   of separation from the sea.},

Abstract = {Twenty-five isolates of F. acuminatum, 38 of F. avenaceum, 1 of F.
   culmorum, 31 of F. oxysporum and 56 of F. sambucinum were obtained in
   1983, 1984 and 1986 from cereal grains and soil from various parts of
   Norway. The isolates were grown on an autoclaved Uncle Ben''s parboiled
   rice medium and examined for production of trichothecenes and other
   toxins and for toxicity in rat feeding tests. F. culmorum N46C(2) and
   Fusarium sambucinum 45-86-A produced zearalenone (F-2) 864 and 665  ppm,
   respectively and caused uterine enlargement in rats. Most of these
   isolates produced no known trichothecene mycotoxins that could account
   for the toxicity that was demonstrated in the rat feeding tests. All but
   F. avenaceum N26B produced fusarin C (1.5 ppm) but caused no toxic
   effects in rat feeding test. None of the isolates produced
   fusarochromanone (TDP-1). Thirteen isolates of F. acuminatum, 16 o F.
   avenaceum, 14 of F. oxysporum and 3 of F. sambucinum produced a
   cytotoxic factor which we named HM-8. One isolate of F. avenaceum, 12 of
   F. oxysporum and 46 of F. sambucinum produced a hemorrhagic factor which
   we named H-1 (wortmannin). Twenty isolates of F. acuminatum, 22 of F.
   avenaceum, 17 of F. oxysporum and 1 of F. sambucinum produced
   moniliformin. Four isolates of F. acuminatum, 9 of F. avenaceum, 25 of
   F. oxysporum and 52 of F. sambucinum caused death to rats. Three
   isolates of F. avenaceum, 19 of F. oxysporum and 47 of F.  sambucinum
   induced hemorrhage in various organs. All isolates caused decreased

Abstract = {One hundred and thirty bacterial strains, isolated from Arctic soil on
   the Svalbard Archipelago, were screened for biosurfactant production.
   Among them, an isolate identified as Pseudomonas putida BD2 was selected
   as a potential biosurfactant-producer based on the surface/interfacial
   activity of the culture supernatant. The ability of the strain to
   produce simultaneously phosphatidylethanolamines and rhamnolipid, using
   glucose as a sole carbon source, was demonstrated. The rhamnolipid
   Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and two homologs of phosphatidylethanolamine were
   extracted from cell-free supernatant of P. putida BD2 culture with ethyl
   acetate and identified by UPLC-MS analysis. For Rha-Rha-C10-C10 the
   surface tension decreased from 72 to 31 mN/m and the critical micelle
   concentration was 0.130 mg/mL. The Rha-Rha-C10-C10 was able to form
   stable aggregates (80-121 nm). Pretreatment of a polystyrene surface
   with 0.5 mg/mL rhamnolipid inhibited bacterial adhesion by 43-79\% and
   that of the pathogenic fungal species C. albi cans by 89-90\%. The same
   concentration of phosphatidylethanolamines inhibited bacterial adhesion
   by 23-72\% and that of C. albicans by 96-98\%. To our knowledge, this is
   the first report where one type rhamnolipid and two homologs of
   phospholipid biosurfactants were produced by P. putida isolated from
   Arctic soil. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   calculated. The portion of the airborne fungi in the ground air layer
   both in the tundra and in the taiga was higher in comparison with the
   bacteria, and amounted to 60-77\% of the total number colony forming
   units (CFU). The least number of microorganisms in the investigated
   period was registered in the Barents Sea coastal atmospheric air, only
   11-15 microbial CFU per 1m(3). The airborne fungi diversity in the taiga
   zone was richer than in the tundra. The fungi of the g. Penicillium
   predominated in both zones air. Bacteria gram-positive (the division
   Fermicutes) predominated within the bacterial biota. The species
   Penicillium decumbens, P. raistrickii prevailed in the air of the
   background tundra zone regions. The representatives of the genus Torula
   and Sterilia mycelia, P. raistrickii predominated in the taiga zone.
   Close by the Copper-Nickel Plant (about 3km), the air bacterial
   contamination (100-600 CFU per 1m(3)) was revealed, with prevailing
   bacteria gram-negative (the division Gracilicutes). The species
   Cladosporium oxysporum predominated in the air to the greatest possible
   extent of the contaminated region due to the emissions of the
   Kandalaksha Aluminum Plant. The species Gongronella butleri were
   uppermost due to the emissions of the Copper-Nickel Plant <<
   Pechenganickel >>. The quantity of the dark-pigmented fungi in the air
   for both zones amounted to 25\% of the total amount within the
   emphasized species. The composition of the air industrial emissions
   stimulated the development of specific airborne fungi which are
   essentially different from those of the background regions.},

Abstract = {The unusually harsh environmental conditions of terrestrial Antarctic
   habitats result in ecosystems with simplified trophic structures, where
   microbial processes are especially dominant as drivers of soil-borne
   nutrient cycling. We examined soil-borne Antarctic communities
   (bacteria, fungi and nematodes) at five locations along a southern
   latitudinal gradient from the Falkland Islands (51 degrees S) to the
   base of the Antarctic Peninsula (72 degrees S), and compared principally
   vegetated vs. fell-field locations at three of these sites. Results of
   molecular (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR),
   biochemical (ergosterol, phospholipid fatty acids) and traditional
   microbiological (temperature- and medium-related CFU) analyses were
   related to key soil and environmental properties. Microbial abundance
   generally showed a significant positive relationship with vegetation and
   vegetation-associated soil factors (e.g. water content, organic C, total
   N). Microbial community structure was mainly related to latitude or
   location and latitude-dependent factors (e.g. mean temperature, NO3,
   pH). Furthermore, strong interactions between vegetation cover and
   location were observed, with the effects of vegetation cover being most
   pronounced in more extreme sites. These results provide insight into the
   main drivers of microbial community size and structure across a range of
   terrestrial Antarctic and sub-Antarctic habitats, potentially serving as
   a useful baseline to study the impact of predicted global warming on
   these unique and pristine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Feeding habits of 25 spp. of oribatids from the North America arctic and
   subarctic were determined by gut content analysis. Over 50\% are
   panphytophages, a feeding habit considered to be ecologically
   advantageous, in that a particular species can survive in many different
   habitats. Microphytophagous species (11) were recorded, predominantly
   from the Damaeoidea, Eremaeoidea and Oppioidea. Individuals of 11 spp.
   of Oribatei were plated to examine the importance of mites in
   disseminating fungi. Fungal species (20) were identified from colonies
   growing on approximately 60\% of the plates. Most of the isolated fungi
   have a world-wide distribution, occurring in soils from tropical to
   arctic regions. Fecal pellets from 7 spp. were also plated. Fungal
   colonies grew from only 14\% of these pellets which may be a result of
   the feeding habits of the species examined. Most species being
   panphytophagous, the amount of fungal material in their gut would vary
   from meal to meal. The direct and indirect effects of oribatid mites on
   decomposition within the soil ecosystem is discussed.},

Abstract = {A new species, Phalansterium arcticum sp. n., was isolated from an
   8580-year-old Arctic permafrost layer. This organism typically lives as
   a sedentary uniflagellated cell enclosed in a thin flexible mucilaginous
   sheath, but can form naked swimming cells and amoeboid cells with
   eruptive pseudopodia accompanied with the formation of short,
   filopodia-like projections. In an SSU rDNA phylogenetic tree, it
   robustly groups with other species of this genus. Along with a
   description of the species, we also add new details to the description
   of the cell division of Phalansterium and the feeding process in this
   organism. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Microorganisms that inhabit the cold Antarctic environment can produce
   ligninolytic enzymes potentially useful in bioremediation. Our study
   focused on characterizing Antarctic bacteria and fungi from marine
   sediment samples of King George and Deception Islands, maritime
   Antarctica, potentially affected by hydrocarbon influence, able to
   produce enzymes for use in bioremediation processes in environments
   impacted with petroleum derivatives. A total of 168 microorganism
   isolates were obtained: 56 from sediments of King George Island and 112
   from Deception Island. Among them, five bacterial isolates were tolerant
   to cell growth in the presence of diesel oil and gasoline and seven
   fungal were able to discolor RBBR dye. In addition, 16 isolates (15
   bacterial and one fungal) displayed enzymatic emulsifying activities.
   Two isolates were characterized taxonomically by showing better
   biotechnological results. Psychrobacter sp. BAD17 and Cladosporium sp.
   FAR18 showed pyrene tolerance (cell growth of 0.03 g mL-1 and 0.2 g
   mL-1) and laccase enzymatic activity (0.006 UL-1 and 0.10 UL-1),
   respectively. Our results indicate that bacteria and fungi living in
   sediments under potential effect of hydrocarbon pollution may represent
   a promising alternative to bioremediate cold environments contaminated
   with polluting compounds derived from petroleum such as polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons and dyes.},

Title = {Resistance and change in a High Arctic ecosystem, NW Greenland:
   Differential sensitivity of ecosystem metrics to 15 years of
   experimental warming and wetting},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Dramatic increases in air temperature and precipitation are occurring in
   the High Arctic (>70 degrees N), yet few studies have characterized the
   long-term responses of High Arctic ecosystems to the interactive effects
   of experimental warming and increased rain. Beginning in 2003, we
   applied a factorial summer warming and wetting experiment to a polar
   semidesert in northwest Greenland. In summer 2018, we assessed several
   metrics of ecosystem structure and function, including plant cover,
   greenness, ecosystem CO2 exchange, aboveground (leaf, stem) and
   belowground (litter, root, soil) carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   concentrations (\%) and pools, as well as leaf and soil stable isotopes
   (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Wetting induced the most pronounced changes
   in ecosystem structure, accelerating the expansion of Salix arctica
   cover by 370\% and increasing aboveground C, N, and biomass pools by
   94\%-101\% and root C, N, and biomass pools by 60\%-122\%, increases
   which coincided with enhanced net ecosystem CO2 uptake. Further, wetting
   combined with warming enhanced plot-level greenness, whereas in
   isolation neither wetting nor warming had an effect. At the plant level,
   the effects of warming and wetting differed among species and included
   warming-linked decreases in leaf N and delta N-15 in S. arctica, whereas
   leaf N and delta N-15 in Dryas integrifolia did not respond to the
   climate treatments. Finally, neither plant- nor plot-level C and N
   allocation patterns nor soil C, N, delta C-13, or delta N-15
   concentrations changed in response to our manipulations, indicating that
   these ecosystem metrics may resist climate change, even in the longer
   term. In sum, our results highlight the importance of summer
   precipitation in regulating ecosystem structure and function in arid
   parts of the High Arctic, but they do not completely refute previous
   findings of resistance in some High Arctic ecosystem properties to
   climate change.},

Title = {Seasonal climate manipulations result in species-specific changes in

Abstract = {P>Climate change in cold biomes not only involves higher summer
   temperatures, but also warmer springs and more winter precipitation. So
   far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal
   components of climate change.
   We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter
   snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in
   sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the
   responses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs
   Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia, the deciduous dwarf
   shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis
   lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus.
   We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and
   carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to
   climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with
   increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios)
   going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs
   and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to
   N-limited plant growth.
   The natural abundance of N-15 varied very strongly among species and
   growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type
   of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope
   discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms,
   but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5 parts per
   thousand). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen
   shrubs < deciduous shrubs.
   After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on
   leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with
   respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among
   species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or
   winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming
   effects.
   This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure
   of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming
   studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated
   nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change
   induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of
   these climate changes.},

Abstract = {Antarctica harbors a microbial diversity still poorly explored and of
   inestimable biotechnological value. Cold-adapted microorganisms can
   produce a diverse range of metabolites stable at low temperatures,
   making these compounds industrially interesting for biotechnological
   use. The present work investigated the biotechnological potential for
   antimicrobial and antitumor activity of filamentous fungi and bacteria
   isolated from marine sediment samples collected at Deception Island,
   Antarctica. A total of 89 microbial isolates were recovered from marine
   sediments and submitted to an initial screening for l-glutaminase with
   antitumoral activity and for antimicrobial metabolites. The isolates
   Pseudogymnoascus sp. FDG01, Pseudogymnoascus sp. FDG02, and Penicillium
   sp. FAD33 showed potential antiproliferative action against human
   pancreatic carcinoma cells while showing no toxic effect on non-tumor
   cells. The microbial extracts from unidentified three bacteria and four
   filamentous fungi showed antibacterial activity against at least one
   tested pathogenic bacterial strain. The isolate FDG01 inhibited four
   bacterial species, while the isolate FDG01 was active against
   Micrococcus luteus in the minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.015625
   mu g mL -1. The results pave the way for further optimization of enzyme
   production and characterization of enzymes and metabolites found and
   reaffirm Antarctic marine environments as a wealthy source of compounds
   potentially applicable in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.},

Abstract = {This review summarizes research concerning Antarctic fungi at the
   century-old historic huts of the Heroic Period of exploration in the
   Ross Dependency 1898-1917 and fungi in pristine terrestrial locations.
   The motivation of the research was initially to identify potential
   fungal causes of degradation of the historic huts and artifacts. The
   research was extended to study fungal presence at pristine sites for
   comparison purposes and to consider the role of fungi in the respective
   ecosystems. We employed classical microbiology for isolation of viable
   organisms, and culture-independent DNA analyses. The research provided
   baseline data on microbial biodiversity. Principal findings were that
   there is significant overlap of the yeasts and filamentous fungi
   isolated from the historic sites, soil, and historic-introduced
   materials (i.e., wood, foodstuffs) and isolated from environmental
   samples in pristine locations. Aerial spore monitoring confirmed that
   winter spore counts were high and, in some cases, similar to those found
   in summer. Microbial diversity varied between the three Ross Island
   historic sites, and one historic site showed noticeably higher
   diversity, which led to the conclusion that this is a variable that
   should not be generalized. Cultured fungi were cold active, and the
   broader scientific significance of this finding was that climate change
   (warming) may not adversely affect these fungal species unless they were
   out-competed by new arrivals or unfavorable changes in ecosystem
   domination occur.},

Title = {Prasiolin, a new UV-sunscreen compound in the terrestrial green
   macroalga Prasiola calophylla (Carmichael ex Greville) Kutzing

Abstract = {We introduced a novel combination of chromatographic techniques for the
   purification and analysis of a new UV-sunscreen mycosporine-like amino
   acid (MAA) in the terrestrial green alga Prasiola calophylla.
   Prasiola calophylla (Carmichael ex Greville) Kutzing (Trebouxiophyceae,
   Chlorophyta) is a typical member of terrestrial algal communities in
   temperate Europe, where it regularly experiences various stress
   conditions including strong diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in
   ultraviolet radiation (UVR). As a photoprotective mechanism Prasiola
   species and other related Trebouxiophycean taxa synthesize a
   mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) as natural sunscreen whose chemical
   structure was unknown so far. In the present study a new methodological
   approach is described for the isolation, purification and structural
   elucidation of this novel sunscreen in P. calophylla. The new compound
   exhibits an absorption maximum at 324 nm (in the short ultraviolet-A), a
   molecular weight of 333 and a molecular extinction coefficient of 12.393
   M-1 cm(-1), and could be identified as N-{[}5,6
   hydroxy-5(hydroxymethyl)-2-methoxy-3-oxo-1-cycohexen-1-yl] glutamic acid
   using one- and two-dimensional H-1 and C-13-NMR spectroscopy. As trivial
   name for this novel MAA we suggest `prasiolin'. The ecologically
   essential function of prasiolin for UVR-protection in terrestrial algae
   of the Trebouxiophyceae is discussed.},

Abstract = {As a part of a large-scale biogeographical study we examined the
   evolutionary relationships and taxonomic position of Marasmius epidryas,
   one of the most typical circumpolar arctic-alpine fungi, characterized
   by a specific, saprobic affinity to dead tissues of Dryas spp. A
   phylogenetic analysis based on nLSU and RPB2 DNA regions unequivocally
   indicated the phylogenetic placement of this species within the
   Physalacriaceae. The Bayesian MCMCMC analysis as well as other inference
   methods tested (ML, NJ) revealed a well supported affinity of M.
   epidryas to Rhizomarasmius pyrrhocephalus, type species of a recently
   circumscribed genus, Rhizomarasmius. As a consequence, based on these
   results, we introduce a new combination, Rhizomarasmius epidryas (Kuhner
   ex A. Ronikier) A. Ronikier and M. Ronikier. Thus our results
   demonstrate that neither the traditional taxonomic placement of the
   fungus in genus Marasmius nor the recent transfer into genus Mycetinis
   are phylogenetically correct. In contrast they support the importance of
   the third lineage of the polyphyletic Marasmius s. l., having
   evolutionary links with taxa forming the Physalacriaceae clade of
   agaricoid fungi. In addition the lineage of Rhizomarasmius was confirmed
   to be closely related to the representatives of Gloiocephala, comprising
   small, often narrowly specialized saprobic species previously also
   classified within Marasmius s. l.},

Title = {Droppings of Svalbard reindeer of cultivable micromycetes on Spitsbergen},
Journal = {POLISH POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-265},
Abstract = {Fungi are highly diverse, yet only a minor part of the total estimated
   species has been cultured and characterized. This might be especially
   true for Arctic, where studies on the fungal diversity are still scarce.
   For that reason, our aim was to analyze fungal diversity in the
   droppings of Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus. The samples of feces from
   32 adult individuals were collected in the southern or central parts of
   the Wedel Jarlsberg Land (Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago) and
   assessed for micromycetes diversity using a combination of classical and
   molecular identification approaches. We found 16 fungal species, out of
   which three were described as mesophilic, two as psychrotolerant and
   eleven as psychrophilic. The identified Arctic fungi belonged to eleven
   genera out of which representatives of Naganishia genus (formerly
   belonging to Cryptococcus albidus clade) were the most abundant fungal
   species isolated. Additionally, to our knowledge, we firstly recorded
   Botrytis cinerea in polar areas. We conclude that droppings of R.
   tarandus platyrhynchus are a source of different fungal taxa, including
   fungi potentially pathogenic towards humans, plants and insects.},

Title = {Characterization of psychrotolerant heterotrophic bacteria from Finnish

Journal = {SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {229-243},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A total of 331 aerobic heterotrophic bacterial strains were isolated
   from various ecosystems of Finnish Lapland (68-69 degrees N) including
   forest soil, arctic alpine-tundra soil, stream water, lake and mire
   sediments, lichen and snow algae. Whole cell fatty acid and 16S rRNA
   gene sequence analysis and microscopy indicated that the isolates were
   dominated by Gram-negative bacteria, while only 20 Gram-positive strains
   were isolated. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences the isolates were
   members of alpha-, beta-, gamma-Proteobacteria, Gram-positives with low
   G+C content, Actinobacteria and the Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides
   group. More than one-third of the isolates could be tentatively
   identified as Pseudomonas spp. which were particularly abundant in the
   alpine-tundra soils where they represented 60\% of all isolates. Other
   frequently isolated Gram-negative taxa were Burkholderia sp., Collimonas
   sp., Pedobacter sp., Janthinobacter sp., Duganella sp., Dyella sp. and
   Sphingomonas sp. Growth temperature ranges and hydrolytic enzyme
   activities of selected ca. 100 strains were screened. The strains were
   psychrotolerant growing generally at temperatures ranging from 0 to 30
   degrees C, as 82\% of the isolates grew at 0 degrees C while only 7\%
   grew at 35 degrees C. Protease and lipase activities at 5 degrees C were
   detected in more than half of the strains while approximately 20\% of
   the strains possessed amylase and/or cellulase activities. (c) 2005

Abstract = {Antarctic environments are characterized by polar climate, making it
   difficult for the development of any form of life. The biogeochemical
   cycles and food web in such restrictive environments may be exclusively
   formed by microorganisms. Polar mycological studies are recent and there
   is much to know about the diversity and genetic resources of these
   microorganisms. In this sense, the molecular taxonomic approach was
   applied to identify 129 fungal isolates from marine and terrestrial
   samples collected from the King George Island (South Shetland Islands,
   Maritime Antarctic). Additionally, the production of cold-adapted
   enzymes by these microorganisms was evaluated. Among the 129 isolates,
   69.0\% were identified by ITS-sequencing and affiliated into 12 genera.
   Cadophora, Geomyces, Penicillium, Cosmospora, and Cladosporium were the
   most abundant genera. Representatives of Cosmospora were isolated only
   from terrestrial samples, while representatives of the others genera
   were recovered from marine and terrestrial samples. A total of 29, 19,
   and 74 isolates were able to produce ligninolytic enzymes, xylanase, and
   l-asparaginase, respectively. Representatives of Cadophora showed great
   ability to produce lignin peroxidase (LiP) and laccase at 15.0 degrees C
   in liquid medium, while representatives of Penicillium and
   non-identified fungi were the best producers of xylanase and
   l-asparaginase at 20.0 degrees C. The high number of fungi able to
   produce enzymes at moderate temperature reveals their potential for
   industrial production and biotechnological applications. The present
   study broadens the knowledge of fungal diversity associated with the
   southern polar region. Additionally, data from molecular taxonomy
   suggest that two filamentous fungi may be considered as potential new
   species.},

Abstract = {Resin acids are tricyclic terpenoids occurring naturally in trees. We
   investigated the occurrence of resin acid-degrading bacteria on the
   Arctic tundra near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island (82 degreesN,
   62 degreesW). According to most-probable-number assays, resin acid
   degraders were abundant (10(3) to 10(4) propagules/g of soil) in
   hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, but they were undetectable (<3
   propagules/g of soil) in pristine soils from the nearby tundra, Plate
   counts indicated that the contaminated and the pristine soils had
   similar populations of heterotrophs (10(6) to 10(7) propagules/g of
   soil). Eleven resin acid-degrading bacteria belonging to four
   phylogenetically distinct groups were enriched and isolated from the
   contaminated soils, and representative isolates of each group were
   further characterized. Strains DhA-91, IpA-92, and IpA-93 are members of
   the genus Pseudomonas, Strain DhA-95 is a member of the genus
   Sphingomonas, All four strains are psychrotolerant, with growth
   temperature ranges of 4<degrees>C to 30 degreesC (DhA-91 and DhA-95) or
   4 degreesC to 22 degreesC (IpA-92 and IpA-93) and with optimum
   temperatures of 15 to 22 degreesC. Strains DhA-91 and DhA-95 grew on the
   abietanes, dehydroabietic and abietic acids, but not on the pimaranes,
   isopimaric and pimaric acids. Strains IpA-92 and IpA-93 grew on the
   pimaranes but not the abietanes, All four strains grew on either
   aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, which is unusual for described resin
   acid degraders. Eleven mesophilic resin acid degraders did not use
   hydrocarbons, with the exception of two Mycobacterium sp, strains that
   used aliphatic hydrocarbons. We conclude that hydrocarbon contamination
   in Arctic tundra soil indirectly selected for resin acid degraders,
   selecting for hydrocarbon degraders that coincidentally use resin acids.
   Psychrotolerant resin acid degraders are likely important in the global
   carbon cycle and may have applications in biotreatment of pulp and paper

Abstract = {Two new cyclopiane diterpenes and a new cladosporin precursor, together
   with four known related compounds, were isolated from the marine
   sediment-derived fungus Penicillium antarcticum KMM 4670, which was
   re-identified based on phylogenetic inference from ITS, BenA, CaM, and
   RPB2 gene regions. The absolute stereostructures of the isolated
   cyclopianes were determined using modified Mosher's method and quantum
   chemical calculations of the ECD spectra. The isolation from the natural
   source of two biosynthetic precursors of cladosporin from a natural
   source has been reported for the first time. The antimicrobial
   activities of the isolated compounds against Staphylococcus aureus,
   Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans as well as the inhibition of
   staphylococcal sortase A activity were investigated. Moreover, the
   cytotoxicity of the compounds to mammalian cardiomyocytes H9c2 was
   studied. As a result, new cyclopiane diterpene 13-epi-conidiogenone F
   was found to be a sortase A inhibitor and a promising
   anti-staphylococcal agent.},

Abstract = {Almost all of the investigated samples of the Arctic and Antarctic
   permafrost sediments of different genesis with ages from 5-10 thousand
   to 2-3 million years were found to contain viable micromycete and
   bacterial cells. The maximum amounts of viable cells of fungi (up to
   10(4) CFU/g air-dried sample) and bacteria (up to 10(7)-10(9) CFU/g
   air-dried sample) were present in fine peaty sediment samples taken from
   different depths. The identified micromycetes belonged to more than 20
   genera of the divisions Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota, and
   some represented mitosporic fungi. Thawing the samples at 35 and 52
   degreesC allowed the number of detected fungal genera to be increased by
   more than 30\%. Aerobic heterotrophic prokaryotes were dominated by
   coryneform, nocardioform, and spore-forming microorganisms of the order
   Actinomycetales. Analysis of the isolated fungi and actinomycetes showed
   that most of them originated from the microbial communities of ancient
   terrestrial biocenoses.},

Abstract = {Aim To screen and identify a potential biosurfactant-producing yeast
   strain isolated from Antarctic soil and to evaluate the fermentation
   process kinetics of the most promising strain on biosurfactant
   production using glycerol as carbon source. Methods and Results From the
   68 isolated yeast strains, 11 strains were able to produce
   biosurfactants after Emulsification Index (E.I.) and Drop Collapse
   tests, reaching an E.I. higher than 10\%. Strain 1\_4.0 was the best
   producer, identified as Candida glaebosa based on molecular analysis.
   Yeast was cultivated in a medium composed of glycerol supplemented with
   yeast extract for 120 h to determine the process kinetics. The increased
   C/N ratio affected yeast growth and biosurfactant production.
   Biosurfactant release was associated with the end of exponential and
   beginning of the stationary growth phases. Results indicated an E.I. of
   30\% at the end of the fermentation. Conclusions The feasiability of C.
   glaebosa to produce biosurfactant from a low-cost medium cultivation
   shows a great impact on the development of bioresource in the Antarctica
   terrestrial environment. Significance and Impact of the Study Although
   the diversity of psychrophilic/psychrotolerant micro-organisms from
   Antarctica has been the preferred subject of study by microbiologists,
   terrestrial microfungal communities are scarcely investigated and
   literature about the biotechnological potential of such micro-organisms
   should cover important biomolecules in addition to cold-adapted enzymes.
   In the present study, for the first time, the Maritime Antarctica
   environment was screened as a novel source of biosurfactants produced by
   micro-organisms.},

Abstract = {Despite adverse conditions in Antarctica for life, organic materials can
   be successfully colonized by extremophilic microorganisms. This work
   describes the isolation of filamentous fungi from terrestrial and
   maritime habitats of King George Island, Antarctica, and the screening
   of their ability to produce antimicrobial compounds. A total of 44
   samples were collected during the Antarctic expeditions from soil,
   sediments, terrestrial and marine waters and pieces of wood that had
   been brought into Antarctica. One hundred thirty-seven psychrotrophic
   fungi were isolated. Thirty-three strains selected from different
   samples and with different morphological characteristics were used in
   molecular identification and antimicrobial activity assays. The ability
   of all isolations to inhibit growth of different bacteria in vitro was
   tested using the agar plug diffusion method.
   Most of the fungi identified were Ascomycota with only a few Zygomycota
   and no Basidiomycota isolated. Twenty-six cultures corresponded to known
   species. Penicillium was the most represented genus of identified fungal
   isolations (24 \%) followed by species of Cadophora, Mortierella,

Title = {Phytotoxic and Antifungal Activity of (-)-Penienone Produced by

Abstract = {Metabolites isolated from Penicillium palitans, obtained from deep sea
   sediments in the maritime Antarctica, were investigated for phytotoxic
   and antifungal activities. The fungus was submitted to solid state
   fermentation, and its crude extract was produced. Chromatographic
   separations of the P. palitans methylene chloride crude extract led to
   the isolation of two analogous compounds: (-)-penienone (1) and
   (-)-palitantin (2). The phytotoxic activity of these compounds was
   assessed against seeds of Lactuca sativa and Agrostis stolonifera. Both
   compounds demonstrated activity exclusively in the monocotyledonous
   model, A. stolonifera. At a concentration of 1 mg mL-1, (-)-penienone
   caused 100 \% inhibition of seed germination, while (-)-palitantin had
   only moderate activity on germination and growth of seedlings at this
   concentration after 7 days of treatment. Against Lemna paucicostata, at
   57 mu M, (-)-penienone inhibited growth by 50 \% (IC50). (-)-Palitantin
   was much less active. When evaluated for their antifungal activity
   against Colletotrichum fragariae, only (-)-penienone had an IC50 value
   of 0.3 mu M. The strain P. palitans was shown to be a promising source
   of phytotoxic and antifungal compounds, suggesting that extremophilic
   fungi, such as wild Penicillium strains from Antarctica, have the
   potential to yield novel prototype molecules for new pesticide
   development.},

Abstract = {Cold-adapted microorganisms can produce enzymes with activity at low and
   mild temperatures, which can be applied to environmental biotechnology.
   This study aimed to characterize 20 Antarctic fungi to identify their
   genus (ITS rDNA marker) and growth temperatures and evaluate their
   ability to decolorize and detoxify the textile dye indigo carmine (IC).
   An individual screening was performed to assess the decolorization and
   detoxification of IC by the isolates, as well as in consortia with other
   fungi. The isolates were affiliated with seven ascomycete genera:
   Aspergillus (n = 4), Cosmospora (n = 2), Leuconeurospora (n = 2),
   Penicillium (n = 3), Pseudogymnoascus (n = 6), Thelebolus (n = 2), and
   Trichoderma (n = 1). The two isolates from the genus Leuconeurospora
   were characterized as psychrophilic, while the others were
   psychrotolerant. The Penicillium isolates were able to decolorize
   between 60 and 82\% of IC. The isolates identified as Pseudogymnoascus
   showed the best detoxification capacity, with results varying from 49 to
   74\%. The consortium using only Antarctic ascomycetes (C1) showed 45\%
   of decolorization, while the consortia with the addition of
   basidiomycetes (C1 + Peniophora and C1 + Pholiota) showed 40\% and 50\%,
   respectively. The consortia C1 with the addition of the basidiomycetes
   presented a lower toxicity after the treatments. In addition, a higher
   fungal biomass was produced in the presence of dye when compared with
   the experiment without the dye, which can be indicative of dye
   metabolization. The results highlight the potential of marine-derived
   Antarctic fungi in the process of textile dye degradation. The findings
   encourage further studies to elucidate the degradation and
   detoxification pathways of the dye IC by these fungal isolates.},

Abstract = {We quantified the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of
   fungi associated with dead moss tissues and conifer needles in a
   forest-tundra ecotone in a sub-Arctic region, Quebec, Canada. We
   detected 615 operational taxonomic units, in total, of fungi in 84
   families with 97\% sequence similarity by metabarcoding the internal
   transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Saprotrophs
   were the dominant functional guild. The results indicated the effects of
   host plant species and local environmental heterogeneity on fungal
   diversity in the cold region. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity
   indices of fungal communities were significantly greater in moss than in
   conifers. The greater phylogenetic diversity in moss was mainly
   attributable to the presence of families in Mucoromycota, compared to
   those in conifers, in which relatively closely related families of
   Dikarya were present. The taxonomic diversity was also related to local
   variations in vegetation and soil properties, suggesting that the local
   colonization and establishment of vegetation and the concomitant
   development of soil contributed to the taxonomic diversity of fungi. In
   contrast, functional diversity was not significantly affected by the
   host, vegetation, or soil properties, indicating that the fungal
   community members were relatively redundant in terms of the evaluated
   functional traits.},

   rhizobia isolated from different geographical regions, and belonging to
   the genera Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium
   were tested against eight herbicides, four fungicides and five
   insecticides. Sensitivity to the pesticides was measured by using the
   filter paper disk method at four concentrations, 0.45, 4.5, 45 and 450
   mu g per disk. When the pesticides were used at 0.45 mu g per disk, a
   concentration similar to that found when pesticides are applied under
   field conditions, no inhibition was observed. Strains growth was
   affected at concentrations of 45 and 450 mu g pesticide per disk. These
   higher concentrations can be encountered when seeds are treated with
   pesticides. Pesticides tolerance level was correlated to pesticide
   function, i.e rhizobial strains were more tolerant to insecticides,
   followed by herbicides and then fungicides. Two fungicides, captan and
   mancozeb, inhibited the highest number of strains. Only one insecticide,
   carbaryl, affected the growth of some rhizobial strains. Strains
   isolated from the arctic (Mesorhizobium spp. and R. leguminosarum bv.

Title = {Detection and diversity of the mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) gene
   cluster and lipase A and B genes of Moesziomyces antarcticus
   isolated from terrestrial sites chronically contaminated with crude oil
   in Trinidad},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Background Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) belong to the class of
   glycolipid biosurfactants and are produced by members of the Ustilago
   and Moesziomyces genera. Production of MELs is regulated by a
   biosynthetic gene cluster (MEL BGC). Extracellular lipase activity is
   also associated with MEL production. Most microbial glycolipid-producers
   are isolated from oil-contaminated environments. MEL-producing yeast
   that are capable of metabolizing crude oil are understudied, and there
   is very limited data on indigenous strains from tropical climates.
   Analysis of the MEL BGC and lipase genes in Trinidad M. antarcticus
   strains, using a gene-targeted approach, revealed a correlation between
   their intrinsic capability to degrade crude oil and their adaptation to
   survive in a chronically polluted terrestrial environment. Results M.
   antarcticus was isolated from naturally-occurring crude oil seeps and an
   asphaltic mud volcano in Trinidad; these are habitats that have not been
   previously reported for this species. Genus identification was confirmed
   by the large-subunit (LSU) and the small-subunit (SSU) sequence
   comparisons and species identification was confirmed by ITS sequence
   comparisons and phylogenetic inference. The essential genes (Emt1, Mac1,
   Mac2, Mmf1) of the MEL BGC were detected with gene-specific primers.
   Emt1p, Mac1p and Mmf1p sequence analyses confirmed that the Trinidad
   strains harboured novel synonymous amino acid (aa) substitutions and
   structural comparisons revealed different regions of disorder,
   specifically for the Emt1p sequence. Functionality of each protein
   sequence was confirmed through motif mining and mutation prediction.
   Phylogenetic relatedness was inferred for Emt1p, Mac1p and Mmf1p
   sequences. The Trinidad strains clustered with other M. antarcticus
   sequences, however, the representative Trinidad M. antarcticus sequences
   consistently formed a separate, highly supported branch for each
   protein. Similar phylogenetic placement was indicated for LipA and LipB
   nucleotide and protein sequences. The Trinidad strains also demonstrated
   lipolytic activity in culture, with an ability to utilize different
   carbon sources. Comparative evolution of MEL BGC and LipA gene suggested
   early and late duplication events, depending on the gene, followed by a
   number of speciation events within Ustilaginaceae. M. antarcticus and M.
   aphidis were separated from all other members of Ustilaginaceae and two
   gene homologues were detected, one for each species. Conclusions
   Sequence analyses was based on a novel gene-targeted approach to analyze
   the essential genes of the MEL BGC and LipA and LipB genes of M.
   antarcticus strains from Trinidad. The findings indicated that these
   strains accumulated nucleotide mutations to a threshold level that did
   not affect the function of specific proteins encoded by the MEL BGC and

Title = {Antarctic fungi applied to textile dye bioremediation},
Journal = {ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Antarctica has one of the most hostile conditions on the planet. The
   environmental characteristics found in this region favor the development
   of extremophile microorganisms, which are poorly explored
   biotechnologically. In this context, this study aimed at selectively
   isolating fungi with potential for the bioremediation of a textile dye.
   A total of 11 filamentous fungi were isolated from Antarctic samples
   after incubation in Minimal Mineral medium with the addition of Sulphur
   Indigo Blue dye. The Antarctic-derived fungi were submitted to textile
   dye decolorization analysis and biomass production. Isolates LAMAI 2400
   and LAMAI 2402 showed more than 90\% of decolorization at 15 degrees C,
   whereas at 28 degrees C these isolates showed 81.86 and 98.89\%,
   respectively. In general, the toxicity of the bioassays, evaluated using
   Cucumis sativus, was higher than in the control. Both isolates, LAMAI
   2400 and LAMAI 2402, were identified as Penicillium cf oxalicum and
   classified as mesophilic-psychrotolerant. This fungal species has rarely
   been reported in the Antarctic environments. The results presented
   herein indicate the potential of the fungi recovered from Antarctic
   marine sediments for bioremediation of textile dyes at low and moderate
   temperatures, broadening the perspectives in the field of Antarctic
   mycology.},

Abstract = {Utilization of industrial side streams as nutrient source for cellular
   agriculture is a promising option to improve the sustainability of the
   production processes. The aim of the study was to evaluate usability of
   two liquid food industry side streams, potato cell fluid and acid whey,
   as nutrient source for production of food ingredients with plant cell
   cultures (arctic bramble (Rubus arcticus L.) and tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana
   tabacum L.)) and filamentous fungi (Paecilomyces variotii, Rhizopus
   oligosporus and Trichoderma reesei). The side streams were found to
   contain various sugars and other potential nutrients suitable for the
   studied organisms. The side streams were used as a sole nutrient source
   (fungi) or as a replacement of selected nutrients in the growth media
   (fungi and plant cells) in flask scale cultivations. Acid whey was
   successfully used as a growth medium for filamentous fungi, but it
   inhibited plant cell growth presumably due to high organic acid content
   (14 g/l). Potato side stream was found suitable as a fungal and plant
   cell growth media supplement, and it was used together with glucose for
   filamentous fungi, or as a partial replacer of macronutrients for plant
   cells, in bioreactor cultivations yielding high fungal (up to 36 g/l dry
   weight) and good plant cell (9.5 g/l dry weight) biomass production.
   Analyses of the produced biomasses revealed good nutritional value in
   terms of amino acid (17-27 \% of dry matter) and dietary fiber (23-30 \%
   of dry matter) contents, giving good premises for utilization in human
   nutrition.},

Abstract = {A study of the fungal flora of soils, plant leaves and litter was

   identified, 27 from leaves and litter and 46 from soil, using
   soil-washing and plating as isolation methods. The predominant fungi on
   leaves and litter of Carex stans and Dryas integrifolia were sterile
   fungi, associated with Cladosporium, Phoma herbarum, Penicillium spp.
   and yeasts. Sterile fungi, Penicillium spp. and Chrysosporium pannorum
   were predominant in raised beach soils, whereas a new species of
   Cylindrocarpon (not ascribed here), a sterile fungi, Penicillium and
   Aspergillus species predominated in meadow soils. Use of direct
   observation methods showed that fungal biomass in meadow soils was much
   higher than in raised beach soils. In raised beach soils fungal biomass
   was heavily influenced by the distribution of cushion plants. In
   comparison with other tundra regions, the Truelove Lowland appears to
   have a moderately rich mycoflora, containing taxa common both in
   temperate regions and in other tundra soils. Total fungal biomass in
   Truelove Lowland soils was low in comparison with many tundra regions.},

Abstract = {Lichens as symbiotic associations consisting of a fungus (the mycobiont)
   and a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont) dominate the terrestrial
   vegetation of continental Antarctica. The photobiont provides carbon
   nutrition for the fungus. Therefore, performance and protection of
   photosystem II is a key factor of lichen survival. Potentials and
   limitations of photobiont physiology require intense investigation to
   extend the knowledge on adaptation mechanisms in the lichen symbiosis
   and to clarify to which extent photobionts benefit from symbiosis.
   Isolated photobionts and entire lichen thalli have been examined. The
   contribution of the photobiont concerning adaptation mechanisms to the
   light regime and temperature conditions was examined by chlorophyll a
   fluorescence and pigment analysis focusing on the foliose lichen
   Umbilicaria decussata from North Victoria Land, continental Antarctica.
   No photoinhibition has been observed in the entire lichen thallus. In
   the isolated photobionts, photoinhibition was clearly temperature
   dependent. For the first time, melanin in U. decussata thalli has been
   proved. Though the isolated photobiont is capable of excess light
   protection, the results clearly show that photoprotection is
   significantly increased in the symbiotic state. The closely related
   photobiont of Pleopsidium chlorophanum, a lichen lacking melanin, showed
   a higher potential of carotenoid-based excess light tolerance. This fact
   discriminates the two photobionts of the same Trebouxia clade. Based on
   the results, it can be concluded that the successful adaptation of
   lichens to continental Antarctic conditions is in part based on the
   physiological potential of the photobionts. The findings provide
   information on the success of symbiotic life in extreme environments.},

Abstract = {Sequence data from a broad geographical region and different habitats
   show that the Inocybe praetervisa clade is comprised of four closely
   related species. These species of section Marginatae are characterized
   by having nodulose spores and a stipe that is abundantly pruinose only
   in the upper half. Inocybe praetervisa occurs in Southern Europe in
   mountainous mixed coniferous forests, and is not confirmed from Northern
   Europe. Inocybe rivularis occurs in northern boreal forests up to the
   lower alpine zone, associated with Betula in moist habitats, and is not
   confirmed from Southern Europe. Inocybe taxocystis is confirmed as a
   later synonym of I. favrei. The species has a wide geographical
   distribution range in Europe, mainly restricted to the alpine zone and
   moist soils, associated with Salix herbacea. Inocybe arctica is here
   described as a new species. It occurs in the arctic and higher alpine
   zones, associated with Dryas octopetala, Salix polaris, S. reticulata
   and S. herbacea. All species except I. arctica are shown to have an
   intercontinental distribution range and are confirmed from North
   America. Sequence data suggest the occurrence of one additional species
   in the alpine zone of China. A key to the species in the I. praetervisa
   group is provided. (C) 2017 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published

Abstract = {Dwarf shrub heaths are common vegetation types of the Arctic and
   Subarctic. Some of the dominant plants in these communities release
   toxic substances which can affect neighbouring plants. We investigated
   the effects of leaf extracts from two dwarf shrubs, Cassiope tetragona
   and Empetrum hermaphroditum, and from mountain birch, Betula pubescens
   spp, tortuosa, on nematode community structure and reproduction in a pot
   and an agar culture experiment. In pots two graminoids, Carex bigelowii
   and Festuca vivipara, were grown in previously sterilized or
   non-sterilized soil. Soil was collected from a subarctic heath, and
   plants from a fellfield site, near Abisko, northern Swedish Lapland. The
   naturally occurring nematode community at the heath site is also
   described, A total of 34 nematode taxa were observed at the field site
   and 32 taxa in the pot experiment. Most species, especially frequent
   taxa, occurred in both soils. Potted soil was strongly dominated by
   bacterial feeders and showed a shift towards a more colonizer controlled
   population. These changes were presumably due to the establishment of
   residual species after freezing and/or sterilization of the soil prior
   to incubation in the laboratory. Direct exposure of the nematode
   Aphelenchoides saprophilus to the leaf extracts in agar cultures
   resulted in a lower reproduction rate. Leaf extract treatment in potted
   soil altered nematode species composition and dominance structure, and
   generally reduced species number and maturity index. The diversity of
   genera was decreased by all extract treatments in pots with Carer,
   Nematode population density was not affected, except after application
   of Betula extracts, where significantly higher densities occurred.
   Nematode data were related to respiration and active fungal biomass in
   the soil, indicating that rather than allelochemicals with nematicidal
   properties, carbohydrates in the leaf extracts promoting a beneficial
   microflora may have affected the nematode community. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {From 18 soil samples taken in the vicinity of the permanent Bulgarian
   Antarctic base ``St. Kliment Ohridski{''} (62A degrees 38'29aEuro(3)S,
   60A degrees 21'53aEuro(3)W) on Livingston Island, 109 filamentous fungi
   were isolated on selective media. The most widespread fungal species
   were members of the genera Cladosporium, Geomyces, Penicillium and
   Aspergillus. Other species, already recorded in Antarctic environment,
   were also isolated: Lecanicillium muscarium, Epicoccum nigrum and
   Alternaria alternata. Thirty strains demonstrating good growth were
   screened for antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
   (CAT) that play an important role in the defense of aerobic organisms
   against oxidative stress, by converting reactive oxygen species into
   nontoxic molecules. Six of them showed high enzyme activity. The tested
   strains produced SOD with statistically significant higher activity at
   15A degrees C than at 30A degrees C suggesting that this enzyme is
   cold-active. Such SOD could be useful in medicine and cosmetics. The
   best producer of cold-active SOD, Aspergillus glaucus 363, cultivated in
   bioreactors, demonstrated optimal growth temperature at 25A degrees C
   and maximum enzyme activities at 25 and 30A degrees C for SOD and CAT,
   respectively. The electrophoretical analysis showed that the fungus
   possesses Cu/Zn-SOD.},

Abstract = {Symbiotic fungi's role in providing nitrogen to host plants is
   well-studied in tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska, but little-studied in the
   adjoining boreal forest ecosystem. Along a 570 km north-south transect
   from the Yukon River to the North Slope of Alaska, the N-15 content was
   strongly reduced in ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plants
   including Betula, Salix, Picea mariana (P. Mill.) B. S. P., Picea glauca
   Moench (Voss), and ericaceous plants. Compared with the N-15 content of
   soil, the foliage of nonmycorrhizal plants (Carex and Eriophorum) was
   unchanged, whereas content of the ectomycorrhizal fungi was very much
   higher (e. g., Boletaceae, Leccinum and Cortinarius). It is hypothesized
   that similar processes operate in tundra and boreal forest, both
   nitrogen-limited ecosystems: (i) mycorrhizal fungi break down soil
   polymers and take up amino acids or other nitrogen compounds; (ii)
   mycorrhizal fungi fractionate against N-15 during production of transfer
   compounds; (iii) host plants are accordingly depleted in N-15; and (iv)
   mycorrhizal fungi are enriched in N-15. Increased N availability for
   plant roots or decreased light availability to understory plants may
   have decreased N allocation to mycorrhizal partners and increased delta
   N-15 by 3 parts per thousand-4 parts per thousand for southern
   populations of Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. and Salix. Fungal biomass,
   measured as ergosterol, correlated strongly with soil organic matter and
   attained amounts similar to those in temperate forest soils.},

Abstract = {Background: Cellulose can be converted to ethanol by simultaneous
   saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The difference between the
   optimal temperature of cellulase and microbial fermentation, however,
   has been identified as the critical problem with SSF. In this study, one
   fungal strain (AnsX1) with high cellulase activity at low temperature
   was isolated from Antarctic soils and identified as Verticillium sp. by
   morphological and molecular analyses. Results: The biochemical
   properties of crude AnsX1 cellulase samples were studied by filter paper
   cellulase assay. The maximum cellulase activity was achieved at low
   temperature in an acidic environment with addition of metal ions.
   Furthermore, AnsX1 cellulase demonstrated 54-63\% enzymatic activity at
   ethanol concentrations of 5-10\%. AnsX1 cellulase production was
   influenced by inoculum size, carbon and nitrogen sources, and elicitors.
   The optimal culture conditions for AnsX1 cellulase production were 5\%
   inoculum, wheat bran as carbon source, (NH4)(2)SO4 as nitrogen source,
   and sorbitol added in the medium. Conclusions: Our present work has
   potential to enable the development of an economic and efficient
   cold-adapted cellulase system for bioconversion of lignocellulosic
   biomass into biofuels in future.},

Abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal fungi have been shown to survive sub-zero temperatures
   in axenic culture and in the field. However, the physiological basis for
   resistance to freezing is poorly understood. In order to survive
   freezing, mycelia must synthesise compounds that protect the cells from
   frost damage, and certain fungal-specific soluble carbohydrates have
   been implicated in this role. Tissue concentrations of arabitol,
   mannitol and trehalose were measured in axenic cultures of eight
   Hebeloma strains of arctic and temperate origin grown at 22, 12, 6 and
   2degreesC. In a separate experiment, mycelia were frozen to -5degreesC
   after pre-conditioning at either 2degreesC or 22degreesC. For. some,
   especially temperate strains, there was a clear increase in specific
   soluble carbohydrates at lower growth temperatures. Trehalose and
   mannitol were present in all strains and the highest concentrations
   (close to 2.5\% and 0.5\% dry wt.) were recorded only after a cold
   period. Arabitol was found in four strains only when grown at low,
   temperature. Cold pre-conditioning enhanced recovery of mycelia
   following freezing. In four out of eight strains, this was paralleled by
   increases in mannitol and trehalose concentration at low temperature
   that presumably contribute towards cryoprotection. The results are
   discussed in an ecological context with regard to mycelial overwintering
   in soil.},

Journal = {ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH},
Year = {1978},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {679-688},
Abstract = {Quantitative changes in bacterial, fungal and algal populations in the
   surface peat (0-5 cm depth) were studied during the spring thaw period
   at a tundra hummocky sedge-moss meadow (Devon Island, N.W.T.
   {[}Northwest Territories], Canada). A significant peak in numbers of
   aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and in amounts of filamentous algae was
   observed during the thaw period. No significant maximum in fungal
   standing crop was evident during this period but an increase in the
   hyphae containing protoplasm after thaw was indicative of increased
   fungal activity. Data obtained at each sampling time were highly
   variable. This was probably due to the topographic heterogeneity of the
   site which gave rise to variation in soil moisture content and
   microenvironment. Qualitative changes in bacterial populations were
   studied before and after the thaw. Gram-negative psychotrophic types
   predominated and Bacillus spp. were rarely isolated. Certain
   gram-negative groups, the fluorescent pseudomonads and the
   Cytophaga/Flexibacter types, were isolated less frequently after thaw
   while gram-negative orange pigmented rods, Arthrobacter spp. and other
   coryneforms occurred more frequently after the thaw.},

Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {1978},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {277-290},
Abstract = {The effect of 36 l m-2 of 20\% and 100\% methanol spillage on the
   microflora of a soil near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, was
   assessed. GLC was used to monitor the residual methanol in the soil.
   Associated with residual methanol determination were measurements of
   changes in numbers of bacteria, fungal standing crop, respiration and
   isolation of methanol-utilizing bacteria. Methanol spillage (20\%) had 2
   different effects on the surface vegetation, in that the vegetation was
   killed in some plots and not others. The applied methanol disappeared
   completely between 1-4 wk. No increased soil activity (as indicated by
   respiration, bacterial numbers, fungal standing crop) was detected when
   methanol was present in the soil. Because only 1 bacterium (i.e., pink
   gram negative rods) metabolized only very small concentrations of
   methanol, biodegradation of methanol was not considered a significant
   agent affecting methanol loss from the soil.},

Title = {Antimicrobial properties and the influence of temperature on secondary

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {60-67},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Arctic and Antarctic share environmental extremes. To survive in
   such environments, microbes such as soil fungi need to compete with or
   protect themselves effectively from other soil microbiota and to obtain
   the often scarce nutrients available, and many use secondary metabolites
   to facilitate this. We therefore (i) screened for antimicrobial
   properties of cold-environment Arctic and Antarctic soil fungi, and (ii)
   identified changes in the secreted secondary metabolite profiles of a
   subset of these strains in response to temperature variation. A total of
   40 polar soil fungal strains from King George Island, maritime Antarctic
   and Hornsund, Svalbard, High Arctic, were obtained from the Malaysian
   National Antarctic Research Centre culture collections. The plug assay
   technique was used to screen for antimicrobial potential against
   Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus
   subtilis, B. cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and
   Escherichia coli). About 45\% of the tested fungal strains showed
   antimicrobial activity against at least one tested microorganism. Three
   fungal isolates showed good bioactivity and were subjected to secondary
   metabolite profiling at different temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 28 degrees
   C). We observed a range of responses in fungal metabolite production
   when incubated at varying temperatures, confirming an influence of
   environmental conditions such as temperature on the production of
   secondary metabolites. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {In this study, we accessed culturable fungal assemblages present in the
   sediments of three lakes potentially impacted anthropogenically in the
   Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica and identified 63
   taxa.Cladosporiumsp. 2,Pseudeurotium hygrophilum, andPseudogymnoascus
   verrucosuswere recovered from the sampled sediments of all lakes. High
   concentrations of metals and the lowest fungal diversity indices were
   detected in the sediments of the Central Lake, which can be influenced
   by human activities due to their proximity to research stations to those
   of the other two lakes, which were far from the Antarctic stations. At
   least one type of biological activity was demonstrated by 40 fungal
   extracts. Among these,P. hygrophilum,P. verrucosus,Penicillium glabrum,
   andPenicillium solitumdemonstrated strong trypanocidal, herbicidal, and
   antifungal activities. Our results suggest that an increase of the
   anthropogenic activities in the region might have affected the microbial
   diversity and composition. In addition, the fungal diversity in these
   lakes may be a useful model to study the effect of anthropogenic
   activities in Antarctica. We isolated a diverse group of fungal taxa
   from Antarctic lake sediments, which have the potential to produce novel
   compounds for the both the medical and agriculture sectors.},

   isolated from samples collected during the U.S.A. Antarctic Expeditions
   of 1980-1982. Samples, consisting of colonized rocks, mosses, lichens,
   sediments and soils, were collected in Southern and Northern Victoria
   Land of the continental Antarctica and in the Antarctic Peninsula. A
   total of 259 different strains were isolated, belonging to 32 genera and
   38 species, out of which 12 represented new taxa. These strains are
   preserved in the Antarctic section of the Culture Collection of Fungi

Title = {Expanding Antarctic biogeography: microbial ecology of Antarctic island
   soils},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The majority of islands surrounding the Antarctic continent are poorly
   characterized in terms of microbial macroecology due to their remote
   locations, geographical isolation and access difficulties. The 2016/2017
   Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) provided unprecedented
   access to a number of these islands. In the present study we use
   metagenomic methods to investigate the microbial ecology of soil samples
   recovered from 11 circum-Antarctic islands as part of ACE, and to
   investigate the functional potential of their soil microbial
   communities. Comparisons of the prokaryote and lower eukaryote
   phylogenetic compositions of the soil communities indicated that the
   various islands harbored spatially distinct microbiomes with limited
   overlap. In particular, we identified a high prevalence of
   lichen-associated fungal taxa in the soils, suggesting that terrestrial
   lichens may be one of the key drivers of soil microbial ecology on these
   islands. Differential abundance and redundancy analyses suggested that
   these soil microbial communities are also strongly shaped by multiple
   abiotic factors, including soil pH and average annual temperatures. Most
   importantly, we demonstrate that the islands sampled in this study can
   be clustered into three distinct large-scale biogeographical regions in
   a conservation context, the sub-, Maritime and Continental Antarctic,
   which are distinct in both environmental conditions and microbial
   ecology, but are consistent with the widely-used regionalization applied
   to multicellular Antarctic terrestrial organisms. Functional profiling
   of the island soil metagenomes from these three broad biogeographical
   regions also suggested a degree of functional differentiation,
   reflecting their distinct microbial ecologies. Taken together, these
   results represent the most extensive characterization of the microbial
   ecology of Antarctic island soils to date.},

Abstract = {Using the method of inoculation of elective nutrient media, the
   abundance and taxonomic diversity of ecological and trophic groups of
   microorganisms in soils of the northern part of the Novaya Zemlya
   Archipelago were evaluated. The content of aerobic and anaerobic
   nitrogen fixers, as well as denitrifiers, was low (tens and hundreds of
   CFU/g soil). The number of saprotrophic bacteria varied from 3.3 x 10(4)
   to 1.2 x 10(6) CFU/g soil; actinomycetes, from 1.3 x 10(3) to 4.0 x
   10(5) CFU/g soil; and micromycetes, from 2.5 x 10(2) to 1.5 x 10(4)
   CFU/g soil. The abundances of all studied groups of microorganisms
   (except for aerobic nitrogen fixers) in the studied soils sharply
   decreased down the profile, and this correlated positively with the
   contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen. The community of soil
   microorganisms was dominated by gram-positive bacteria of the genera
   Arthrobacter and Bacillus; actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces and
   Micromonospora; and micromycetes of the genera Goffeauzyma, Phoma,
   Pseudogymnoascus, and Thelebolus. In general, the abundance and
   taxonomic diversity of cultured microorganisms in the soils of the
   northern part of Novaya Zemlya were lower than in the soils of the more
   northern territories of the Franz Josef Land Archipelago. This
   phenomenon is associated with the drying and cooling effect of the
   largest glacier in Russia on the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the discovery of endolithic algae from vertical
   limestone cliffs associated with the Niagara Escarpment, southern
   Ontario, Canada. The endolithic habitat forms a distinctive dark green
   layer 1-3 mm below the surface of the porous dolomitic limestone.
   Samples of the algal layer were isolated from freshly cleaved rock
   samples using sterile probes and grown on a solid (agarized) standard
   algal mineral medium supplemented with soil extract. A diverse
   assemblage of organisms grew on the agar plates, including bacteria,
   fungi, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), green algae, yellow-green
   algae, and occasionally the protonemata of mosses. Isolated algae belong
   to unicellular, colonial, and filamentous morphological types. Algal
   genera that have been identified include seven blue-green algae
   (Cyanophyta or Cyanobacteria), six green algae (Chlorophyta), and one
   yellow-green alga (Xanthophyceae). Six of the algal genera found in
   Ontario rocks also occur inside rocks of the Colorado plateau in
   northern Arizona, and one genus also occurs inside Antarctic rocks.},

Journal = {MICROBIOLOGY},

Volume = {91},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-66},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The mycobiota of the following soils of the Franz Josef Land archipelago
   was characterized using the classical plating techniques and real-time
   PCR methods: Cryosols (Arenic), Cryosols (Loamic), Oxyaquic Cryosols
   (Loamic), Leptosols (Loamic), and Cryosols (Loamic, Humic). The total
   abundance of microscopic fungi varied from 3.10 x 10(1) CFU/g soil in
   deep mineral horizons to 6.56 x 10(3) CFU/g soil in the upper
   organogenic soil horizons. A total of 47 micromycete species were
   isolated, which belonged to 32 genera from three divisions.
   Psychrotolerant strains growing at both 5 and 25 degrees C were
   predominant. The genera Penicillium (five species), Cadophora (four
   species), Cladosporium, Phoma, and Thelebolus (three species each)
   exhibited the highest species diversity. The most numerous genera:
   Penicillium, Hyphozyma, Phoma, Antarctomyces, and Pseudogymnoascus, were
   saprotrophic and common in cold ecosystems. Pseudogymnoascus pannorum,
   Hyphozyma variabilis var. variabilis, Penicillium aurantiogriseum,
   Thelebolus microsporus, and Goffeauzyma gilvescens were the species most
   often revealed by plating (over 40\% occurrence). A significant part
   (30\%) of identified species were those included in the BSL database of
   species pathogenic for humans and animals. The number of copies of
   fungal rRNA gene ITSs varied from 1.00 x 10(9) to 4.40 x 10(10) copies/g
   soil in the mineral and organogenic layers, respectively. Spatial
   heterogeneity of mycobiota in the soils of the Franz Josef Land
   archipelago was revealed within the upper 5-cm layer, while deeper
   horizons were characterized by a uniform structure of micromycete
   communities.},

Abstract = {AimsThe aim of this study was to cross correlate data on
   physico-chemical parameters of soil with rhizosphere microorganisms and
   plant species in order to gain more knowledge about formation of soil
   and development of plants in the face of the changing climate on
   Spitsbergen and relations between them.MethodsWe investigated
   physico-chemical parameters of soil samples and the number and
   biodiversity of microorganisms, bacteria (oligotrophic and
   copiotrophic), and fungi. Moreover, heavy metal concentrations in 6
   species of vascular plants collected in different areas were
   analysed.ResultsThe soil samples varied considerably in pH - from acid
   to alkaline, texture - from sand to loamy sand, and C:N ratio - from
   very low to high. In the soils, only partial Cd elevation expressed as
   the geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and the enrichment factor (EF) was
   detected. In the plants, the most significantly elevated concentrations
   of heavy metals expressed as I-geo and EF as well as the biological
   accumulation factor, bioconcentration factor, and translocation factor
   were detected in Salix polaris, Dryas octopetala, and Draba corymbosa.
   The high number of bacteria corresponded with an increase in the
   ecophysiological diversity index and the low colony development index,
   whereas a reverse relationship was found for fungi.ConclusionsThere was
   no significant impact of the geochemical properties on the total content
   of heavy metals in soil. The similar position of Cd and Pb in the order
   of heavy metal accumulation in the soil and plants was confirmed. TF
   showed that mainly these two metals were transported efficiently from
   roots to shoots. In the plants, the metals were distributed depending on
   the life form and their higher levels were detected in the woody
   perennials, e.g. S. polaris, D. octopetala, D. corymbosa, than in the
   herbaceous perennials. Very high numbers of culturable microorganisms
   were determined, regardless of the soil properties and plant species,
   which indicated that they were involved in the transformation of
   compounds containing C, N, and P and in the availability of heavy
   metals. The microorganisms and plants colonizing Spitsbergen soils
   showed great plasticity and adaptability to low temperatures and
   elevated Cd content.},

Abstract = {A novel psychrophilic basidiomycetous species is described in a new
   anamorphic genus as Mrakiella cryoconiti gen. nov., sp. nov.; the type
   strain of Mrakiella cryoconiti is strain A15(T) (=CBS 10834(T)-DSM
   21094(T)). Two representatives were isolated from alpine glacier
   cryoconite and from northern Siberian sediment. Physiological and
   biochemical properties are similar to characteristics shared by members
   of the genus Mrakia, although sexual reproduction is absent. Mrakiella
   cryoconiti strains are psychrophilic and produce cold-active pectate
   lyase. Sequence analyses of the ITS and 26S rRNA D1/D2 regions indicated
   that these strains represent a distinct taxon within the Mrakia clade of
   the order Cystofilobasidiales, class Tremellomycetes and phylum
   Basidiomycota. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics,
   Cryptococcus aquaticus (a member of the Mrakia clade) is transferred to
   the newly described genus as Mrakiella aquatica comb. nov.},

Abstract = {Among 97 fungal strains isolated from soil collected in the arctic
   tundra (Spitsbergen), Penicillium chrysogenum 9' was found to be the
   best lipase producer. The maximum lipase activity was 68 units mL(-1)
   culture medium on the fifth day of incubation at pH 6.0 and 20 degrees
   C. Therefore, P. chrysogenum 9' was classified as a psychrotrophic
   microorganism. The non-specific extracellular lipase showed a maximum
   activity at 30 degrees C and pH 5.0 for natural oils or at pH 7.0 for
   synthetic substrates. Tributyrin was found to be the best substrate for
   lipase, among those tested. The K-m and V-max were calculated to be 2.33
   mM and 22.1 units mL(-1), respectively, with tributyrin as Substrate.
   The enzyme was inhibited more by EDTA than by phenylmethylsulfonyl
   fluoride and was reactivated by Ca2+. The P. chrysogenum 9' lipase was
   very stable in the presence of hexane and 1,4-dioxane at a concentration
   of 50\%, whereas it was unstable in presence of xylene.},

Journal = {IMA FUNGUS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {The genus Pseudogymnoascus includes several species frequently isolated
   from extreme environments worldwide, including cold environments such as
   Antarctica. This study describes three new species of
   Pseudogymnoascus-P. russus sp. nov., P. irelandiae sp. nov., and P.
   ramosus sp. nov.-isolated from Antarctic soils. These species represent
   the first Pseudogymnoascus taxa to be formally described from Antarctic
   soil samples, expanding our understanding of fungal biodiversity in this
   extreme environment. Microscopic descriptions of asexual structures from
   living cultures, along with measurements of cultural characteristics and
   growth on various media types at different temperatures, identify three
   distinct new species. In addition, phylogenetic analyses based on five
   gene regions (ITS, LSU, MCM7, RPB2, TEF1) and whole-genome proteomes
   place these new species within three distinct previously described
   clades: P. irelandiae in clade K, P. ramosus in clade Q, and P. russus
   in clade B. These results provide further evidence of the extensive
   undescribed diversity of Pseudogymnoascus in high-latitude soils. This
   study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on Antarctic mycology
   and the broader ecology of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant fungi.},

Abstract = {Psychrophilic fungi are a critical biotic component in cold deserts that
   serves a central role in nutrient recycling and biogeochemical cycles.
   Despite their ecological significance, culture-independent studies on
   psychrophilic mycobiome are limited. In the present study, the fungal
   diversity patterns across the Drass, an Indian cold desert in the
   Himalaya, were indexed by targeted amplicon pyrosequencing (ITS). In the
   Drass dataset, Ascomycota was represented by 92 genera, while 22 genera
   represented Basidiomycota. The most abundant genus was Conocybe
   (20.46\%). Most of the identified genera were reported in the literature
   to be prolific extracellular hydrolytic enzyme producers. To identify
   whether the Drass fungal assemblages share similarities to other cold
   deserts, these were further compared to Antarctic and Arctic cold
   deserts. Comparative analysis across the three cold deserts indicated
   the dominance of Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The observed
   alpha diversity, Shannon index as well as Pielou's evenness was highest
   in the Antarctic followed by Drass and Arctic datasets. The genera
   Malassezia, Preussia, Pseudogymnoascus, Cadophora, Geopora, Monodictys,
   Tetracladium, Titaea, Mortierella, and Cladosporium were common to all
   the cold deserts. Furthermore, Conocybe was represented predominantly in
   Drass. Interestingly, the genus Conocybe has not been previously
   reported from any other studies on Antarctic or Arctic biomes. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first fungal metagenome study in
   Drass soil. Our analysis shows that despite the similarities of low
   temperature among the cold deserts, a significant differential abundance
   of fungal communities prevails in the global cold deserts.},

Abstract = {Deception Island is well-known for harboring highly diverse microbial
   communities due to its unique volcanic environment in Antarctica. Most
   studies focused on bacteria, and relatively little was known about the
   fungal species on this island. The present study was aimed to determine
   the antimicrobial production and nutrient utilization profiles of a soil
   fungus from Deception Island, designated as Im33. Our findings showed
   that the strain had maximum mycelial growth and sporulation on
   malt-extract agar (MEA) medium, but it demonstrated the strongest
   antimicrobial activity in yeast extract-malt extract broth (YMB) medium.
   Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 regions
   showed that it is a species belonging to the genus Talaromyces. It was
   resistant to cycloheximide concentrations up to 1,000 mg/L and exhibited
   broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and
   Gram-negative test pathogens, as well as being able to utilize a variety
   of carbon sources. This is the first report of a Talaromyces species
   from Deception Island. The capability of the strain to produce
   broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds and various enzymes indicated
   that Antarctic fungi, like their bacterial counterparts, have adopted
   various adaptation strategies to compete and survive in the extreme
   environment.},

Abstract = {Studies on the diversity and catabolic functionality of fungi in Arctic
   soils are still scarce. This knowledge gap needs to be urgently
   addressed, as global warming may have unpredictable effects on
   cold-adapted fungal species. We isolated two yeast species of the family
   Filobasidiaceae: Goffeauzyma gilvescens and Naganishia albidosimilis,
   from soil in central Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and characterised their
   metabolic properties at two temperatures, 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C,
   in a laboratory test using Biolog (R) FF plates. The results of the
   Biolog (R) test, which followed molecular identification of the strains,
   confirmed that the two species differed in their functional (catabolic)
   characteristics. The effect of temperature was also highly significant
   and the metabolic characteristics of two species varied between the two
   temperatures tested. As expected, among other chemical guilds of
   substrates on Biolog (R) plates, carbohydrates were the most used and
   also the most segregating of the strains studied, especially at 20
   degrees C. However, the relative use of almost all substrate groups
   changed between the two temperatures for both species tested, indicating
   that temperature can also affect soil microorganisms indirectly by
   altering their metabolic pathways. As soil microorganisms form a complex
   trophic and non-trophic network, such changes in metabolism under
   increasing temperature may also alter relationships between species and
   between species and the environment. Our study contributes to a better
   understanding of the microbial ecology of the unique ecosystem of polar
   soils.},

Title = {Selection, Succession, and Stabilization of Soil Microbial Consortia},

Abstract = {Soil microorganisms play fundamental roles in cycling of soil carbon,
   nitrogen, and other nutrients, yet we have a poor understanding of how
   soil microbiomes are shaped by their nutritional and physical
   environment. In this study, we investigated the successional dynamics of
   a soil microbiome during 21 weeks of enrichment on chitin and its
   monomer, N-acetylglucosamine. We examined succession of the soil
   communities in a physically heterogeneous soil matrix as well as a
   homogeneous liquid medium. The guiding hypothesis was that the initial
   species richness would influence the tendency for the selected consortia
   to stabilize and maintain a relatively constant community structure over
   time. We also hypothesized that long-term, substrate-driven growth would
   result in consortia with reduced species richness compared to the parent
   microbiome and that this process would be deterministic with relatively
   little variation between replicates. We found that the initial species
   richness does influence the long-term community stability in both liquid
   media and soil and that lower initial richness results in a more rapid
   convergence to stability. Despite use of the same soil inoculum and
   access to the same major substrate, the resulting community composition
   differed greatly in soil from that in liquid medium. Hence, distinct
   selective pressures in soils relative to homogenous liquid media exist
   and can control community succession dynamics. This difference is likely
   related to the fact that soil microbiomes are more likely to thrive,
   with fewer compositional changes, in a soil matrix than in liquid
   environments.
   IMPORTANCE The soil microbiome carries out important ecosystem
   functions, but interactions between soil microbial communities have been
   difficult to study due to the high microbial diversity and complexity of
   the soil habitat. In this study, we successfully obtained stable
   consortia with reduced complexity that contained species found in the
   original source soil. These consortia and the methods used to obtain
   them can be a valuable resource for exploration of specific mechanisms
   underlying soil microbial community ecology. The results of this study
   also provide new experimental context to better inform how soil
   microbial communities are shaped by new environments and how a
   combination of initial taxonomic structure and physical environment
   influences stability.},

Abstract = {The modern concept of the evolution of Mars assumes that life could
   potentially have originated on the planet Mars, possibly during the end
   of the late heavy bombardment, and could then be transferred to other
   planets. Since then, physical and chemical conditions on Mars changed
   and now strongly limit the presence of terrestrial-like life forms.
   These adverse conditions include scarcity of liquid water (although
   brine solutions may exist), low temperature and atmospheric pressure,
   and cosmic radiation. Ionizing radiation is very important among these
   life-constraining factors because it damages DNA and other cellular
   components, particularly in liquid conditions where radiation-induced
   reactive oxidants diffuse freely. Here, we investigated the impact of
   high doses (up to 2 kGy) of densely-ionizing (197.6 keV/mu m),
   space-relevant iron ions (corresponding on the irradiation that reach
   the uppermost layer of the Mars subsurface) on the survival of an
   extremophilic terrestrial organism-Cryomyces antarcticus-in liquid
   medium and under atmospheric conditions, through different techniques.
   Results showed that it survived in a metabolically active state when
   subjected to high doses of Fe ions and was able to repair eventual DNA
   damages. It implies that some terrestrial life forms can withstand
   prolonged exposure to space-relevant ion radiation.},

Abstract = {Background: Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp \& Endl.) Krasser, known as
   ``lenga{''} is the most important timber wood species in southernmost
   Patagonia (Argentina). Humicolopsis cephalosporioides Cabral \& Marchand
   is a soil fungus associated with Nothofagus pumilio forests, which has
   outstanding cellulolytic activity. However, there is no information
   about the ability of this fungus to use organic substrates other than
   cellulose, and its ability to produce different enzyme systems, as well
   as its response to temperature.
   Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the role of H.
   cephalosporioides in degradation processes in N. pumilio forests in
   detail by evaluating the in vitro ability of four isolates of this
   fungus to grow and produce different lytic enzyme systems, and their
   response to incubation temperature.
   Methods: The ability of the fungi to grow and produce enzyme systems was
   estimated by inoculating them on agar media with specific substrates,
   and the cultures were incubated at three temperatures.
   Results: A differential behavior of each strain in levels of growth and
   enzyme activity was found according to the medium type and/or incubation
   temperature.
   Conclusions: A intra-specific variability was found in H.
   cephalosporioides. Likewise a possible link between the saprotrophic
   role of this fungus in N. pumilio forests and the degradation of organic
   matter under stress conditions, such as those from frosty environments,
   was also discussed. (C) 2013 Revista Iberoamericana de Micologia.

Abstract = {Psychrotolerant yeast Rhodotorula sp. Y-23 was isolated from the
   sediment core sub-samples of Nella Lake, East Antarctica. Isolate was
   screened for lipase production using plate assay method followed by
   submerged fermentation. Production optimization revealed the maximum
   lipase production by using palmolein oil (5\% v/v), pH 8.0 and inoculum
   size of 2.5\% v/v at 15 degrees C. The potential inducers for lipase
   were 1\% w/v of galactose and KNO3, and MnCl2 (0.1\% w/v). Final
   productions with optimized conditions gave 5.47-fold increase in lipase
   production. Dialyzed product gave a purification fold of 5.63 with
   specific activity of 26.83Umg(-1) and 15.67\% yields. This lipase was
   more stable at pH 5.0 and -20 degrees C whereas more activity was found
   at pH 8.0 and 35 degrees C. Stability was more in 50mM Fe3+, EDTA-Na
   (20mM), sodium deoxycholate (20mM), H2O2 (1\% v/v), and almost all
   organic solvents (50\% v/v). Tolerance capacity at wider range of pH and
   temperature with having lower K-m value i.e., 0.08mgml(-1) and higher
   V-max 385.68Umg(-1) at 15 degrees C make the studied lipase useful for
   industrial applications. Besides this, the lipase was compatible with
   commercially available detergents, and its addition to them increases
   lipid degradation performances making it a potential candidate in
   detergent formulation.},

   rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequences of the Svalbard isolate were
   identical to those of Canadian and Japanese isolates of P. ultimum var.
   ultimum. The results suggest that the pathogen in the greenhouse on

Abstract = {The role of organo-mineral interactions, microbial dynamics, and
   vertical plant input profiles are hypothesized to be important in
   controlling soil organic matter (SOM) stocks and dynamics. To test this
   hypothesis, we enhanced and applied a model (Biotic and Abiotic Model of
   SOM BAMSI) that represents microbial dynamics and organo-mineral
   interactions integrated with a multiphase reactive transport solver for
   variably saturated porous media. The model represents aqueous chemistry,
   aqueous advection and diffusion, gaseous diffusion, sorption processes,
   bacterial and fungal activity, and archetypal monomer-and polymer-carbon
   substrate groups, including dead cell wall material. This model
   structure is fundamentally different, and produces different SOM
   dynamics, than the pseudo-first order relationships that are used in
   most site-and global-scale terrestrial SOM models. We simulated two
   grasslands, a seven-site chronosequence (-3.9-240 K gamma) in Northern
   California, and a Russian Chernozem site where soils were sampled 100
   years apart. We calibrated the model's vertically-resolved soil bulk
   specific surface area (SBSSA) using observed bulk SOM content, and then
   tested the model against observed triangle C-14 profiles. The modeled
   microbial processes, organo-mineral interactions, and vertical aqueous
   transport produced realistic vertically-resolved predictions of bulk SOM
   content, triangle C-14 values of SOM, lignin content, and fungi
   -to-aerobic bacteria biomass ratios. Using sensitivity analyses, we
   found that vertical carbon input profiles were important controls over
   the triangle C-14 depth distribution. Shallower carbon input profiles
   lead to older carbon at depth. In addition, the SBSSA was the dominant
   control over the magnitude and vertical distribution of SOM stocks. The
   findings of this study demonstrate the value of explicitly incorporating
   microbial activity, sorption, and vertical transport into land models to
   predict SOM dynamics.},

Title = {Inhibitory effects of climate change on the growth and extracellular

Volume = {27},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Temperatures approaching or exceeding 20 degrees C have been measured
   during summer in polar regions at the surfaces of barren fellfield soils
   under cloudless skies around solar noon. However, despite the upper
   temperature limit for the growth of cold-adapted microbes-which are
   abundant in polar soils and have pivotal roles in nutrient
   cycling-typically being close to this temperature, previous studies have
   not addressed the consequences of climate change for the metabolism of
   these organisms in the natural environment. Here in a 5-year field
   experiment on Alexander Island in the southern maritime Antarctic, we
   show that the abundance of Pseudogymnoascus roseus, the most widespread
   decomposer fungus in maritime Antarctic fellfield soils, is reduced by
   1-2 orders of magnitude when irrigated and nutrient-amended soils are
   warmed to >20 degrees C during summer. Laboratory experiments under
   conditions mimicking those during midsummer in the natural environment
   indicated that the hyphal extension rates of P. roseus isolates and the
   activities of five extracellular enzymes are reduced by 54\%-96\% at
   high water availability after exposure to temperatures cycling daily
   from 2 to 21 degrees C and 2 to 24 degrees C, relative to temperatures
   cycling from 2 to 18 degrees C. Given that the temperatures of surface
   soils at the study site already reach 19 degrees C during midsummer, the
   observations reported here suggest that, at predicted rates of warming
   arising from moderate greenhouse gas emissions, inhibitory effects of
   climate change on the metabolism of P. roseus could manifest themselves
   within the next few decades. Furthermore, with peak temperatures at the
   surfaces of fellfield soils at other maritime Antarctic locations and in
   High Arctic and alpine regions already exceeding 20 degrees C during
   summer, the observations suggest that climate warming has the potential
   to inhibit the growth of other cold-adapted microbes, with negative
   effects on soils as the Earth's climate continues to warm.},

Title = {Culturable root endophyte communities are shaped by both warming and
   plant host identity in the Rocky Mountains, USA},
Journal = {FUNGAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {49},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the biogeographic patterns of root-associated fungi and
   their sensitivity to temperature may improve predictions of future
   changes in terrestrial biodiversity and associated ecosystem processes,
   but data are currently limited. Anticipating change will require
   combining observational data, which predict how climatic factors limit
   current species distributions, with direct manipulations of climate,
   which can isolate responses to specific climate variables. Root
   endophytes are common symbionts of plants, particularly in arctic and
   alpine environments, yet their responses to climate warming are not
   resolved. Here, we directly cultured endophytic fungi from roots
   collected along altitudinal gradients in replicated mountain watersheds
   and from a 27 y field warming experiment in the Rocky Mountains, USA, to
   improve understanding of climate impacts on fungal root endophytes.
   Fungal taxa that were common at high elevations declined most under
   climate warming, whereas low elevation dominants responded neutrally or
   increased with experimental warming. Altitudinal gradients in fungal
   communities were strongly specific to the plant host species.
   Specifically, Poa species had 25-60\% greater fungal isolate abundance
   and 25-38\% greater fungal diversity at high elevations than at low
   elevation sites. In contrast, Festuca thurberi had 64\% lower fungal
   diversity on roots at high elevation than at low elevation. Our results
   help to improve understanding of the potential for climate change to
   alter plant-fungal interactions in mountain ecosystems. (C) 2020

Journal = {FUNGAL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities have been studied worldwide;
   however, those in the very cold and dry continental climate zone of
   northern Eurasia remain understudied. We investigated EM fungal
   community structure on plant roots and its determinants in eastern
   Siberia. We identified 291 EM fungal taxa belonging to 37 fungal genera
   from nine sites spanning 2100 km. In a variation partitioning analysis,
   host plant phylogeny was the primary factor that explained variation in
   fungal community composition, followed by spatial distance, soil, and
   climate. Host specificity and preference were attributed to differences
   in EM fungal community composition among host plants. The EM fungal
   community on Larix cajanderi, the dominant canopy tree in the region,
   was characterized by a high proportion of Suillus and Rhizopogon
   species. This implies that these specialist fungal symbionts have a
   close ecological relationship with pioneer Larix trees to adapt to the
   harsh continental climate of Siberia.},

Abstract = {The diversity of yeasts collected from different sites in Antarctica
   (Admiralty Bay, King George Island and Port Foster Bay and Deception
   Island) and their ability to produce extracellular enzymes and
   mycosporines were studied. Samples were collected during the austral
   summer season, between November 2006 and January 2007, from the
   rhizosphere of Deschampsia antarctica, ornithogenic (penguin guano)
   soil, soil, marine and lake sediments, marine water and freshwater from
   lakes. A total of 89 isolates belonging to the following genera were
   recovered: Bensingtonia, Candida, Cryptococcus, Debaryomyces, Dioszegia,
   Exophiala, Filobasidium, Issatchenkia (Pichia), Kodamaea,
   Leucosporidium, Leucosporidiella, Metschnikowia, Nadsonia, Pichia,
   Rhodotorula, and Sporidiobolus, and the yeast-like fungi Aureobasidium,
   Leuconeurospora and Microglossum. Cryptococcus victoriae was the most
   frequently identified species. Several species isolated in our study
   have been previously reported to be Antarctic psychophilic yeasts,
   including Cr. antarcticus, Cr. victoriae, Dioszegia hungarica and
   Leucosporidium scottii. The cosmopolitan yeast species A. pullulans, C.

   Rh. mucilaginosa, and S. salmonicolor were also isolated. Five possible
   new species were identified. Sixty percent of the yeasts had at least
   one detectable extracellular enzymatic activity. Cryptococcus
   antarcticus, D. aurantiaca, D. crocea, D. hungarica, Dioszegia sp., E.
   xenobiotica, Rh. glaciales, Rh. laryngis, Microglossum sp. 1 and
   Microglossum sp. 2 produced mycosporines. Of the yeast isolates, 41.7\%
   produced pigments and/or mycosporines and could be considered adapted to
   survive in Antarctica. Most of the yeasts had extracellular enzymatic
   activities at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C, indicating that they could
   be metabolically active in the sampled substrates.},

Abstract = {Two new cold-adapted yeast species, Cystobasidium tubakii sp. nov. and
   Cystobasidium ongulense sp. nov., were isolated from soil collected from
   East Ongul Island, East Antarctica, during the 49th Japanese Antarctic
   Research Expedition (JARE 49). Molecular analysis based on large subunit
   (LSU) D1/D2 domain and the combined sequences of small subunit (SSU)
   rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, LSU D1/D2 domain and
   TEF1 sequences showed that these species are novel. Both species could
   grow at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free media. These
   characteristics were likely obtained by the yeasts to survive
   oligotrophic environments such as that in Antarctica. This is the first
   report of new fungal species isolated from near the Syowa station in the
   60-y history of JARE. (C) 2016 The Mycological Society of Japan.

Abstract = {Investigations of microbial diversity in Antarctic are important to
   begin to understand ecosystem functioning and decomposition processes.
   This study documents fungi at 9 historic sites on the Antarctic
   Peninsula collected from wooden structures, other organic materials, and
   soils during a joint National Science Foundation and British Antarctic
   Survey expedition in 2007. Many of these sites had wooden structures
   built by the British during the World War II Operation Tabarin, but
   others visited included the American ``East Base'' on Stonington Island
   and the Swedish hut on Snow Hill Island. Fungi were cultured on several
   different media and pure cultures were obtained and identified by DNA
   sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Cadophora species
   previously found to attack historic wooden structures on Ross Island,
   Antarctica, were found at all but 1 location sampled in the Peninsula
   region. Fungi causing decay in the historic wooden structures and
   artifacts and those causing mold problems inside the structures are of
   great concern, and conservation efforts are urgently needed to help
   preserve these important polar heritage structures. The results
   presented also expand our knowledge on the identity of fungi present
   throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region and provide insights into the
   organisms responsible for decomposition and nutrient recycling.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Shrub encroachment and soil respiration (SR) are predicted to increase
   in the tundra ecosystem under climate warming, but little is known
   regarding potential causal relationships between shrubs and SR at a
   local scale. Multiple and complex belowground processes exist between
   the two phenomena, and consolidation is logistically difficult. Our
   study aimed to identify and integrate multiple belowground processes to
   elucidate the impact of shrub coverage on SR, using structural equation
   modeling (SEM). Results indicated that shrub coverage enhanced SR
   through root biomass, fungal community composition and soil temperature.
   SEM also revealed a potential indirect effect via interactions among
   those soil factors. Soil factors relating heterotrophic respiration
   affected on SR through more complex interaction among the factors.
   However, total effect sizes on SR were similar between factors relating
   autotrophic respiration and that relating heterotrophic respiration,
   suggesting that SR increases with shrub coverage would be unlikely to
   result from decreases in soil organic matter.},

Abstract = {The fungal communities associated with three bryophytes species (the
   liverwort Barbilophozia hatcheri, the mosses Chorisodontium aciphyllum
   and Sanionia uncinata) in the Fildes Region, King George Island,
   maritime Antarctica, were studied using clone library analysis. Fungal
   communities showed low diversity; the 680 clones belonged to 93 OTUs. Of
   these, 78 belonged to the phylum Ascomycota, 13 to the phylum
   Basidiomycota, 1 to the phylum Zygomycota, and 1 to an unknown phylum.
   Among the OTUs, the most common orders in the Ascomycota were Helotiales
   (42 OTUs) and Chaetothyriales (14 OTUs) and the most common orders in
   the Basidiomycota were Sebacinales (3 OTUs) and Platygloeales (3 OTUs).
   Most OTUs clustered within clades that contained phylotypes identified
   from samples in Antarctic or Arctic ecosystems or from bryophytes in
   other ecosystems. In addition, we found that host-related factor may
   shape the fungal communities associated with bryophytes in this region.
   This is the first systematic study of the fungal community in Antarctic
   bryophytes to be performed using culture-independent method and the
   results may improve understanding of the endophytic fungal evolution and
   ecology in the Antarctic ecosystem.},

Abstract = {A strain of Phialocephala fortinii isolated from Luetkea pectinata was
   used to inoculate axenically grown 1-wk-old Menziesia ferruginea
   (Ericaceae) seedlings in cellulose agar petri dish cultures. After 3 mo,
   P. fortinii was observed in cortical cells of whole root mounts. but not
   in the stele. The fungus produced dark, simple septate hyphae forming
   extensive wefts on the root surface and intracortical sclerotia
   consisting of compact masses of darkly pigmented and irregularly lobed,
   thick-walled hyphae. Isolates of P. fortinii also formed numerous
   sclerotia in the cellulose agar medium. Presence of P. fortinii caused a
   ten-fold increase in seedling mortality over controls. Growth rates,
   based on whole plant fresh weight, were not affected by the presence of
   P. fortinii. Cenococcum geophilum, Phialocephala dimorphospora, and
   Phialophora finlandia, which were also used as inoculum for comparative
   purposes, did not form sclerotia in M. ferruginea. This is the first
   report to show that the distinct fungus-root associations formed between
   P.fortinii and subalpine plants can be reproduced consistently in pure
   culture under laboratory conditions.},

Abstract = {Seven chromate-reducing yeasts isolated from Antarctic soils (with no
   history of Cr(VI) contamination) were evaluated as promising candidates
   for alleviating Cr(VI)-contamination. These yeast species have not been
   extensively studied regarding Cr(VI) tolerance and reduction abilities.
   Based on their tolerance (up to 2 mM) and ability to remove Cr(VI) from
   culture media, two representative isolates of Candida sake \#14 and
   Debaryomyces hansenii \#35 were chosen. The resistant yeasts were
   cultivated in YM medium plus 1 mM Cr(VI) at 25 degrees C, causing a
   removal of similar to 90 and similar to 70\% hexavalent chromium before
   reaching 96 h of culture according to growth curves of C. sake \#14 and
   D. hansenii \#35, respectively. Cr(VI) removal kinetic analysis
   indicated that both isolates removed Cr(VI) by reduction to Cr(III), and
   incorporated a small portion into the biomass. Scanning Electron
   Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) confirms the
   biosorption process, indicating the existence of a complex remediation
   mechanism. In conclusion, Antarctica is an extreme environment with a
   potential to discover promising new candidates for the removal of
   Cr(VI). These results are interesting from a biotechnological point of
   view since psychrotolerant yeasts could be involved in the design of a
   profitable technology for the elimination of the toxic form of Cr.},

Abstract = {Climate warming is severely affecting high-latitude regions. In the
   Arctic tundra, it may lead to enhanced soil nutrient availability and
   interact with simultaneous changes in grazing pressure. It is presently
   unknown how these concurrently occurring global change drivers affect
   the root-associated fungal communities, particularly mycorrhizal fungi,
   and whether changes coincide with shifts in plant mycorrhizal types. We
   investigated changes in root-associated fungal communities and
   mycorrhizal types of the plant community in a 10-yr factorial experiment
   with warming, fertilisation and grazing exclusion in a Finnish tundra
   grassland. The strongest determinant of the root-associated fungal
   community was fertilisation, which consistently increased potential
   plant pathogen abundance and had contrasting effects on the different
   mycorrhizal fungal types, contingent on other treatments. Plant
   mycorrhizal types went through pronounced shifts, with warming favouring
   ecto- and ericoid mycorrhiza but not under fertilisation and grazing
   exclusion. Combination of all treatments resulted in dominance by
   arbuscular mycorrhizal plants. However, shifts in plant mycorrhizal
   types vs fungi were mostly but not always aligned in their magnitude and
   direction. Our results show that our ability to predict shifts in
   symbiotic and antagonistic fungal communities depend on simultaneous
   consideration of multiple global change factors that jointly alter plant
   and fungal communities.},

Abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, plant species and diverse root-associated
   fungi form complex networks of host-symbiont associations. Recent
   studies have revealed that structures of those below-ground plant-fungus
   networks differ between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal
   symbioses. Nonetheless, we still remain ignorant of how ericaceous plant
   species, which dominate arctic and alpine tundra, constitute networks
   with their root-associated fungi. Based on a high-throughput DNA
   sequencing data set, we characterized the statistical properties of a
   network involving 16 ericaceous plant species and more than 500 fungal
   taxa in the alpine-subalpine region of Mt. Tateyama, central Japan.
   While all the 16 ericaceous species were associated mainly with fungi in
   the order Helotiales, they varied remarkably in association with fungi
   in other orders such as Sebacinales, Atheliales, Agaricales, Russulales
   and Thelephorales. The ericaceous plant-fungus network was characterized
   by high symbiont/host preferences. Moreover, the network had a
   characteristic structure called `anti-nestedness', which has been
   previously reported in ectomycorrhizal plant-fungus networks. The
   results lead to the hypothesis that ericaceous plants in harsh
   environments can host unexpectedly diverse root-associated fungal taxa,
   constituting networks whose structures are similar to those of
   previously reported ectomycorrhizal networks but not to those of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal ones.},

Journal = {FUNGAL DIVERSITY},

Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {27-74},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The diversity of filamentous fungi that can grow at high ambient pH
   values (i.e., 8-11) remains largely understudied. Here we study 100
   alkalitolerant and alkaliphilic isolates from the soils around the basin
   of soda lakes in Asia and Africa to assess the major evolutionary
   lineages and morphologies pertinent to the alkaliphilic trait in
   filamentous fungi. The Emericellopsis lineage (Hypocreales,
   Hypocreomycetidae), along with Plectosphaerellaceae (Hypocreomycetidae),
   Pleosporaceae (Dothideomycetes), Chaetomiaceae (Sordariomycetidae)
   families appeared to be overrepresented with strong alkalitolerants and
   effective alkaliphiles. In particular, Sodiomyces species
   (Plectosphaerellaceae), Acrostalagmus luteoalbus (Plectosphaerellaceae),
   Emericellopsis alkalina (Hypocreales), Thielavia sp. (Chaetomiaceae),
   and Alternaria sect. Soda (Pleosporaceae) grew best at high ambient pH.
   The pH tolerance of Chordomyces antarcticum, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus
   and some other species was largely affected by the presence of extra Na+
   in the growth medium. Moderate alkalitolerants included Scopulariopsis
   members (Microascales), Fusarium, Cladosporium, and many asexual
   acremonium-like species from Bionectriaceae. Weak alkalitolerants were
   represented by sporadic isolates of Penicillium, Purpureocillium
   lilacinum, and Alternaria alternata species, with the growth optimum at
   neutral or acidic pH. Weak alkalitolerants develop loose dry chains of
   spores easily dispersed by air. Their presence at low frequency with the
   growth optimum at neutral or acidic pH leads us to treat them as
   transient species in the alkaline soils, as those are also ubiquitous
   saprobes in normal soils. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the
   alkaliphilic trait in filamentous fungi has evolved several times.
   Several lineages harboring strong alkalitolerants derived from the known
   marine-borne fungi (Emericellopsis, Alternaria sect. Phragmosporae), or
   fall within the fungi associated with halophytic grasses
   (Pleosporaceae). Soda soils contain a diversity of fungi that range from
   weak alkalitolerant to alkaliphilic, which in few cases is associated
   with darkly pigmented mycelium and formation of microsclerotia. The
   alkaliphilic trait is spread throughout the Ascomycota, and usually
   juxtaposes with slime-covered polyphyletic acremonium-, verticillium-,
   gliocladium-types of asexual morphology, hyphae aggregating in chords,
   and enclosed fruit bodies.},

   44\%, respectively, for this period. The GC-MS analyses were applied to
   identify salicylic acid, catechol, and ketoadipic acid as intermediates
   in the naphthalene degradation. The intermediates identified in
   anthracene catabolism are 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid, o-phthalic acid,
   and protocatechuic acid. The enzyme activities for phenol
   2-monooxygenase (1.14.13.7) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (1.13.11.1)
   were established. A gene encoding an enzyme with catechol
   1,2-dioxygenase activity was identified and sequenced (GeneBank Ac. No
   KM360483). The recent study provides original data on the potential of
   an ascomycete's fungal strain A. glaucus strain AL 1 to degrade
   naphthalene and anthracene.},

Abstract = {The distribution of the fungal biomass and diversity of cultivated
   microscopic fungi in the profiles of some soils from East (Progress
   Station, valleys of the Larsemann Hills oasis) and West (Russkaya
   Station, the Marie Byrd Land) Antarctica regions were studied. The
   structure of the biomass (spore/mycelium and live cells/dead cells) was
   analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with staining using a set of
   coloring agents: calcofluor white, ethidium bromide, and fluorescein
   diacetate. The species composition of the cultivated microscopic fungi
   was determined on Czapek's medium. The fungal biomass in the soils
   studied is not high (on the average, 0.3 mg/g of soil); the greatest
   biomass (0.6 mg/g) was found in the soil samples with plant residues.
   The fungal biomass is mainly (to 70\%) represented by small (to 2.5 mu
   m) spores. About half of the fungal biomass is composed of living cells.
   There are differences in the distribution of the fungal biomass within
   the profiles of different primitive soils. In the soil samples taken
   under mosses and lichens, the maximal biomass was registered in the top
   soil horizons. In the soils with the peat horizon under stone pavements,
   the greatest fungal biomass was registered in the subsurface horizons.
   Thirty-eight species of cultivated microscopic fungi were isolated from
   the soils studied. Species of the genus Penicillium and Phoma herbarum
   predominated.},

Abstract = {The potential for Pythium species to reduce sainfoin (Onobrychis

   (VA) mycorrhizal fungi to enhance seedling growth were studied under
   controlled conditions. Seedling emergence and shoot dry weights of cvs.
   Nova and Melrose in pasteurized soils infested with each of 18 isolates
   of Pythium spp. were reduced. Seedlings inoculated with arctic rhizobia
   grew more rapidly than noninoculated seedlings. Plant growth, nodule dry
   weight, nitrogenase activity, and mycorrhizal colonization of sainfoin
   dually inoculated with Rhizobium plus either Glomus fasciculatus or G.
   intraradices were greater than those of uninoculated plants or those
   inoculated with either rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungus alone; nitrogen
   content was higher in plants concomitantly inoculated with Rhizobium
   plus G. intraradices. Seedling survival and growth in Pythium-infested
   soil increased for seeds treated with metalaxyl. Interactions of VA
   mycorrhizal fungi and two isolates of Pythium were investigated under
   controlled conditions. Shoot dry weights of sainfoin plants inoculated
   with VA mycorrhizal fungi significantly exceeded those of nonmycorrhizal
   plants. Seedlings inoculated with VA mycorrhizal fungi had a lower
   incidence of root rot than non-mycorrhizal ones. This study suggested
   that a combination of rhizobia, metalaxyl, and VA mycorrhizal fungi
   could be used to improve the establishment and vigor of sainfoin in

Title = {Communities of Putative Ericoid Mycorrhizal Fungi Isolated from Alpine
   Dwarf Shrubs in Japan: Effects of Host Identity and Microhabitat},
Journal = {MICROBES AND ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Dwarf shrubs of the family Ericaceae are common in arctic and alpine
   regions. Many of these plants are associated with ericoid mycorrhizal
   (ERM) fungi, which allow them to take nutrients and water from the soil
   under harsh environmental conditions and, thus, affect host plant
   survival. Despite the importance of ERM fungi to alpine plant
   communities, limited information is available on the effects of
   microhabitat and host identity on ERM fungal communities. We
   investigated the communities of putative ERM fungi isolated from five
   dwarf shrub species (Arcterica nana, Diapensia lapponica, Empetrum
   nigrum, Loiseleuria procumbens, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) that co-occur
   in an alpine region of Japan, with reference to distinct microhabitats
   provided by large stone pine (Pinus pumila) shrubs (i.e. bare ground,
   the edge of stone pine shrubs, and the inside of stone pine shrubs). We
   obtained 703 fungal isolates from 222 individual plants. These isolates
   were classified into 55 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the
   sequencing of internal transcribed spacer regions in ribosomal DNA.
   These putative ERM fungal communities were dominated by Helotiales fungi
   for all host species. Cistella and Trimmatostroma species, which have
   rarely been detected in ERM roots in previous studies, were abundant.
   ERM fungal communities were significantly different among microhabitats
   (R-2=0.28), while the host effect explained less variance in the fungal
   communities after excluding the microhabitat effect (R-2=0.17). Our
   results suggest that the host effect on ERM fungal communities is minor
   and the distributions of hosts and fungal communities may be assessed
   based on microhabitat conditions.},

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Soils support a vast amount of carbon (C) that is vulnerable to climatic
   and anthropogenic global change stressors (for example, drought and
   human-induced nitrogen deposition). However, the simultaneous effects of
   an increasing number of global change stressors on soil C storage and
   persistence across ecosystems are virtually unknown. Here, using 1,880
   surface soil samples from 68 countries across all continents, we show
   that increases in the number of global change stressors simultaneously
   exceeding medium-high levels of stress (that is, relative to their
   maximum levels observed in nature) are negatively and significantly
   correlated with soil C stocks and mineral association across global
   biomes. Soil C is particularly vulnerable in low-productivity ecosystems
   (for example, deserts), which are subjected to a greater number of
   global change stressors exceeding medium-high levels of stress
   simultaneously. Taken together, our work indicates that the number of
   global change stressors is a crucial factor for soil C storage and
   persistence worldwide.
   Soil carbon storage is vulnerable to various climatic and anthropogenic
   global change stressors (for example drought, warming, land-use
   intensification). Here the authors show that multiple stress factors act
   simultaneously to reduce soil carbon storage and persistence across
   global biomes.},

Abstract = {The supply of recent photosynthate from plants to soils is thought to be
   a critical mechanism regulating the activity and diversity of soil
   biota. In the Arctic, large-scale vegetation transitions are underway in
   response to warming, and there is an urgent need to understand how these
   changes affect soil biodiversity and function. We investigated how
   abundance and diversity of soil fungi and invertebrates responded to a
   reduction in fresh below-ground photosynthate supply in treeline birch
   and willow, achieved using stem girdling. We hypothesised that birch
   forest would support greater abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal
   species and fauna than willow shrubs, and that girdling would result in
   a rapid switch from ECM fungi to saprotrophs as canopy supply of C was
   cut, with a concomitant decline in soil fauna. Birch forest had greater
   fungal and faunal abundance with a large contribution of root-associated
   ascomycetes (ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes) compared to
   willow shrub plots, which had a higher proportion of saprotrophs and,
   contrary to our expectations, ECM fungi. Broad-scale soil fungal and
   faunal functional group composition was not significantly changed by
   girdling, even in the third year of treatment. Within the ECM community,
   there were some changes, with genera that are believed to be
   particularly C-demanding declining in girdled plots. However, it was
   notable how most ECM fungi remained present after 3 years of isolation
   of the below-ground compartment from contemporary photosynthate supply.
   Synthesis. In a treeline/tundra ecosystem, distinct soil communities
   existed in contrasting vegetation patches within the landscape, but the
   structure of these communities was resistant to canopy disturbance and
   concomitant reduction of autotrophic C inputs.},

   in the active and permafrost layers of peatlands within frozen peatbogs
   in the flatland areas of the cryolitozone, European Northeast of Russia
   (forest-tundra zone, southern and northern tundra subzones). Fungal
   taxonomic list includes eighty-three species from seventeen genera and
   two forms of Mycelia sterilia. The phylum Mucoromycota is represented by
   fifteen species (18\% of total isolate number), and these species
   exhibit the following distribution by genus: Mucor (four), Mortierella
   (seven), Umbelopsis (three), Podila (one). Ascomycota is represented by
   sixty-eight species from thirteen genera. The genus Penicillium
   dominates the species saturation (thirty-seven species, 44\%). Soil
   microfungal complex is represented by rare species (51\%), random
   species (32\%), frequent species (15\%), and dominant species (2\%). In
   peat soils, dominant species are Penicillium canescens (72\%) and
   non-pigmented (albino) Mycelia sterilia (61\%); abundant species are

Abstract = {Cryptoendolithic microbial communities, living in porous sandstone rocks
   in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Ross Desert) of Southern Victoria Land,
   Antarctica, were found within weathered pegmatite rocks in Northern
   Victoria Land, and the first endemic Antarctic fungal genus
   Friedmanniomyces endolithicus anam.- gen. and sp. nov. was isolated from
   this community. Selected microfungi from these communities and from soil
   were examined for the production of extracellular enzymes and antibiotic
   substances. The cryptoendolithic strain CCFEE 5001 was particularly
   remarkable for consistent glycosidase activity, coupled with barely
   detectable growth. Chitnase activity was highest in the soil microfungus
   Verticillium cfr. lecanii (CCFEE 5003). This strain and its purified
   chitinase were active on Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium cladosporioides,
   Aspergillus versicolor, and Penicillium verrucosum, producing mycelial
   damage and cell lysis. The strain CCFEE 5020, isolated from rocks,
   showed antibiotic activity against Pseudomonas putida, Sarcina sp.,
   Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli, under the test conditions. Good
   antibiotic activity was produced in the temperature range of 5 degrees
   to 25 degrees C, pH 4.0, agitation at 700 rpm, and areation at 1.0 vvm,
   in media containing 0.5\% substrate sugar, though this supported only
   minimal growth. The investigation of soil microfungi in contrasting
   sites at the BIOTAS area at Edmonson Point indicated that both the
   presence of bird colonies and changes in temperature and UV exposure
   obtained by using plastic cloches influenced species composition and
   density, A `Culture Collection of Fungi from Extreme Environments'
   (CCFEE) has been established at the University of Tuscia, housing fungal
   strains from Antarctica.},

Journal = {FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-340},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Humic substances (HS) in soil are widely distributed in cold
   environments and account for a significant fraction of soil's organic
   carbon. Bacterial strains (n = 281) were isolated at 15 degrees C using
   medium containing humic acids (HA), a principal component of HS, from a
   variety of polar soil samples: 217 from the Antarctic and 64 from the
   Arctic. We identified 73 potential HA-degrading bacteria based on 16S
   rRNA sequence similarity, and these sequences were affiliated with phyla
   Proteobacteria (73.9\%), Actinobacteria (20.5\%), and Bacteroidetes
   (5.5\%). HA-degrading strains were further classified into the genera
   Pseudomonas (51 strains), Rhodococcus (10 strains), or others (12
   strains). Most strains degraded HA between 10 and 25 degrees C, but not
   above 30 degrees C, indicating cold-adapted degradation. Thirty unique
   laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) gene fragments were
   PCR-amplified from 71\% of the 73 HA-degrading bacterial strains, all of
   which included conserved copper-binding regions (CBR) I and II, both
   essential for laccase activity. Bacterial LMCO sequences differed from
   known fungal laccases; for example, a cysteine residue between CBR I and
   CBR II in fungal laccases was not detected in bacterial LMCOs. This
   suggests a bacterial biomarker role for LMCO to predict changes in
   HS-degradation rates in tundra regions as global climate changes.
   Computer-aided molecular modeling showed these LMCOs contain a
   highly-conserved copper-dependent active site formed by three histidine
   residues between CBR I and CBR II. Phylogenetic- and modeling-based
   methods confirmed the wide occurrence of LMCO genes in HA-degrading
   polar soil bacteria and linked their putative gene functions with
   initial HS-degradation processes.},

Abstract = {Fossil evidence of a high southern palaeolatitude (approximately 75-78
   degrees South) Middle Jurassic (Temaikan) forest from Gondwana is
   investigated from the Murihiku Supergroup exposed at Kawhia Harbour.
   North Island, New Zealand. Horizons of fossilised tree stumps, preserved
   in growth position and rooted within coal-rich layers at bedding
   contacts, are exposed within cross-bedded medium-grained sandstone on
   the present-day shore platform. Interbedded siltstone and fine-grained
   sandstone contain terrestrial palynomorphs, fossilised leaves and other
   macroflora material (including cones and seeds). The sediments are
   interpreted as three fluvial facies (vegetated bar top, major sheet
   flood and channel fill and migration) within a sandy braided river
   palaeoenvironment. The fossil flora suggest the original vegetation was
   multi-layered and dominated by gymnosperms and ferns. Lycopods,
   bryophytes, fungi and algae also grew on the forest floor and in bar top
   pools. A model of plant communities is presented reflecting changing
   habitats up the side of interdistributary bars. The model is based on
   stratigraphically successive taphocenoses within vegetated bar top
   facies and the preferred growing conditions and life forms of comparable
   modern relatives. Lycopods and bryophytes on the saturated channel banks
   became less frequent higher up the bar on the damp, partially drained
   soil preferred by ferns and cycad trees. Favouring the drier bar top,
   arborescent gymnosperms thrived around probably ephemeral pools
   containing lycopods, bryophytes and algae. The characteristics of this
   fossil forest at Kawhia Harbour compare well to a similar Middle
   Jurassic site at Curie Bay in South Island, New Zealand, and other high
   southern palaeolatitude fossil floras from the late Mesozoic. A humid,
   warm climate with high average annual rainfall and large storms is
   interpreted from the Kawhia Harbour fossil forest for the New Zealand
   Middle Jurassic. These palaeoclimatic conditions are comparable to the
   modern mesothermal zone. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Reported data on the diversity and physiological capabilities of fungi
   inhabiting ice-free outcrops of continental Antarctica are limited. The
   present study aimed at investigating the occurrence of fungi on
   fragments of microbial mats on the lakeshore and lake water and compared
   it with fungal occurrence on terrestrial moss, using a culture-dependent
   method. Another purpose was to evaluate the responses of hyphal growth
   to temperature and the profiles of substrate utilization of fungal
   isolates under pure culture conditions. A total of 46 fungal isolates
   were obtained and grouped into eight taxa, with Phoma herbarum being the
   most frequent taxon, the occurrence of which was closely related to the
   nitrogen level of the substrata. The colony diameter growth rates of
   most fungal isolates under pure culture conditions increased linearly
   with temperature to reach the maximum at 20-25 degrees C, indicating
   that these fungi were mesophilic. Moreover, fungal isolates exhibited
   diversity and redundancy in their utilization of 71 carbon sources,
   having potentials to utilize an array of substrates including sugars,
   sugar alcohols, hexose-phosphates, amino acids, hexose acids, and
   carboxylic acids.},

Title = {Induction and Characterisation of Lignocellulolytic Activities from
   Novel Deep-Sea Fungal Secretomes},
Journal = {FERMENTATION-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fungi are increasingly recognised as being able to inhabit extreme
   environments. The deep sea is considered an extreme environment because
   of its low temperatures, high hydrostatic and lithostatic pressures,
   3.5\% salinity, and low oxygen, nutrient and light availability. Fungi
   inhabiting the deep sea may have evolved to produce proteins that allow
   them to survive these conditions. Investigation and characterisation of
   fungal lignocellulolytic enzymes from extreme environments like the deep
   sea is needed, as they may have unusual adaptations that would be useful
   in industry. This work, therefore, aimed to profile in detail the
   lignocellulolytic capabilities of fungi isolated from deep-sea sediments
   in the Atlantic Ocean, and a comparative lignocellulolytic terrestrial
   isolate. The isolates were strains of Emericellopsis maritima,
   Penicillium chrysogenum, P. antarcticum and Talaromyces stollii.
   Lignocellulolytic enzyme induction was achieved using liquid-state
   fermentation (LSF) with wheat bran as the main carbon source, while
   enzyme characteristics were evaluated using biochemical assays and
   gel-based proteomics. This study revealed that the isolates were
   halotolerant, produced xylanase over wide pH and temperature ranges, and
   produced a variety of glycoside hydrolase and feruloyl esterase
   activities. The T. stollii secretome demonstrated remarkable levels of
   exo-glycoside hydrolase activity, with xylanase activity optimum between
   pH 1.5-6.0 and temperatures between 1-60 C-degrees, making this isolate
   an ideal candidate for biotechnological applications. This study is the
   first to quantitatively characterise xylanase activities and
   exo-glycoside hydrolase activities secreted by E. maritima, P.
   antarcticum and a marine T. stollii strain. This study is also the first
   to quantitatively characterise xylanase activities by a marine strain of
   P. chrysogenum during LSF.},

Title = {Environmental DNA - An emerging tool in conservation for monitoring past
   and present biodiversity},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {183},

Abstract = {The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis
   and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political
   agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large
   part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of
   biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are
   un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity
   essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to
   obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates.
   Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of
   species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However,
   traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties
   associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile
   life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise,
   non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey
   techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient
   techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA
   (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from
   environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious
   signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and
   easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive,
   cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be
   an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring.
   Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern
   samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of
   ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing
   that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity
   in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of
   macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments,
   revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since
   been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental
   samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to
   the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring
   contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the
   future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker
   analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire
   ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such
   advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and
   environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through
   analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and
   discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity
   monitoring. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {A comprehensive assessment of fungal communities in various habitats

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME},

Abstract = {Background In the ice-free area of maritime Antarctica, fungi are the
   essential functioning group in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Until
   now, no study has been conducted to comprehensively assess fungal
   communities in various habitats in Antarctica. We aimed to characterize
   fungal communities in the eleven habitats (i.e., soil, seawater,
   vascular plant, dung, moss, marine alga, lichen, green alga, freshwater,
   feather) in the Fildes Region (maritime Antarctica) using
   next-generation sequencing. Results A total of 12 known phyla, 37 known
   classes, 85 known orders, 164 known families, 313 known genera, and 320
   known species were detected. Habitat specificity rather than habitat
   overlap determined the composition of fungal communities, suggesting
   that, although fungal communities were connected by dispersal at the
   local scale, the environmental filter is a key factor driving fungal
   assemblages in the ice-free Antarctica. Furthermore, 20 fungal guilds
   and 6 growth forms were detected. Many significant differences in the
   functional guild (e.g., lichenized, algal parasite, litter saprotroph)
   and growth form (e.g., yeast, filamentous mycelium, thallus
   photosynthetic) existed among different habitat types. Conclusion The
   present study reveals the high diversity of fungal communities in the
   eleven ice-free Antarctic habitats and elucidates the ecological traits
   of fungal communities in this unique ice-free area of maritime
   Antarctica. The findings will help advance our understanding of fungal
   diversity and their ecological roles with respect to habitats on a
   neighbourhood scale in the ice-free area of maritime Antarctica.},

Abstract = {We provide the first assessment of fungal diversity associated with
   historic wooden structures at Whalers Bay (Heritage Monument 71),
   Deception Island, maritime Antarctic, using DNA metabarcoding. We
   detected a total of 177 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)
   dominated by the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota,
   Chytridiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Rozellomycota, and Zoopagomycota.
   The assemblages were dominated by Helotiales sp. 1 and
   Herpotrichiellaceae sp. 1. Functional assignments indicated that the
   taxa detected were dominated by saprotrophic, plant and animal
   pathogenic, and symbiotic taxa. Metabarcoding revealed the presence of a
   rich and complex fungal community, which may be due to the wooden
   structures acting as baits attracting taxa to niches sheltered against
   extreme conditions, generating a hotspot for fungi in Antarctica. The
   sequences assigned included both cosmopolitan and endemic taxa, as well
   as potentially unreported diversity. The detection of DNA assigned to
   taxa of human and animal opportunistic pathogens raises a potential
   concern as Whalers Bay is one of the most popular visitor sites in
   Antarctica. The use of metabarcoding to detect DNA present in
   environmental samples does not confirm the presence of viable or
   metabolically active fungi and further studies using different culturing
   conditions and media, different growth temperatures and incubation
   periods, in combination with further molecular approaches such as
   shotgun sequencing are now required to clarify the functional ecology of
   these fungi.},

Title = {A Previously Undescribed Helotialean Fungus That Is Superabundant in
   Soil Under Maritime Antarctic Higher Plants},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {We report a previously undescribed member of the Helotiales that is
   superabundant in soils at two maritime Antarctic islands under Antarctic
   Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.). High throughput sequencing
   showed that up to 92\% of DNA reads, and 68\% of RNA reads, in soils
   from the islands were accounted for by the fungus. Sequencing of the
   large subunit region of ribosomal (r)DNA places the fungus close to the
   Pezizellaceae, Porodiplodiaceae, and Sclerotiniaceae, with analyses of
   internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA indicating that it has
   affinities to previously unnamed soil and root fungi from alpine, cool
   temperate and Low Arctic regions. The fungus was found to be most
   frequent in soils containing C aged to 1,000-1,200 years before present.
   The relative abundances of its DNA and RNA reads were positively
   associated with soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations and delta C-13
   values, with the relative abundance of its DNA being negatively
   associated with soil pH value. An isolate of the fungus produces
   flask-shaped phialides with a pronounced venter bearing masses of
   conidia measuring 4.5-6(7) x 1.8-2.5 mu m, suggestive of anamorphic
   Chalara. Enzymatic studies indicate that the isolate strongly
   synthesizes the extracellular enzyme acid phosphatase, and also exhibits
   alkaline phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities.
   Ecophysiological measurements indicate optimal hyphal growth of the
   isolate at a pH of 4.2-4.5 and a water potential of -0.66 MPa. The
   isolate is a psychrotroph, exhibiting measureable hyphal growth at -2
   degrees C, optimal hyphal extension rate at 15 degrees C and negligible
   growth at 25 degrees C. It is proposed that the rising temperatures that
   are predicted to occur in maritime Antarctica later this century will
   increase the growth rate of the fungus, with the potential loss of
   ancient C from soils. Analyses using the GlobalFungi Database indicate
   that the fungus is present in cold, acidic soils on all continents. We
   advocate further studies to identify whether it is superabundant in
   soils under D. antarctica elsewhere in maritime Antarctica, and for
   further isolates to be obtained so that the species can be formally
   described.},

Title = {Twenty Species of Hypobarophilic Bacteria Recovered from Diverse Soils

Abstract = {Bacterial growth at low pressure is a new research area with
   implications for predicting microbial activity in clouds and the bulk
   atmosphere on Earth and for modeling the forward contamination of
   planetary surfaces like Mars. Here, we describe experiments on the
   recovery and identification of 20 species of bacterial hypobarophiles
   (def., growth under hypobaric conditions of approximately 1-2 kPa) in 10
   genera capable of growth at 0.7 kPa. Hypobarophilic bacteria, but not
   archaea or fungi, were recovered from diverse soils, and high numbers of
   hypobarophiles were recovered from Arctic and Siberian permafrost soils.
   Isolates were identified through 16S rRNA sequencing to belong to the
   genera Bacillus, Carnobacterium, Clostridium, Cryobacterium,
   Exiguobacterium, Paenibacillus, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, and
   Trichococcus. The highest population of culturable hypobarophilic
   bacteria (5.1 x 10(4) cfu/g) was recovered from Colour Lake soils from
   Axel Heiberg Island in the Canadian Arctic. In addition, we extend the
   number of hypobarophilic species in the genus Serratia to six
   type-strains that include S. ficaria, S. fonticola, S. grimesii, S.
   liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, and S. quinivorans. Microbial growth at 0.7
   kPa suggests that pressure alone will not be growth-limiting on the
   martian surface, or in Earth's atmosphere up to an altitude of 34 km.},

Abstract = {Antarctica is a pristine and extreme environment that represents a
   unique opportunity for taxonomic, ecological and biotechnological
   studies of the microorganisms. In the present work, the fungal
   communities of rhizosphere soil of Deschampsia antarctica, soil,
   ornithogenic soil, marine and lake sediments in the Antarctic Peninsula
   were characterized as well as their capability to produce bioactive
   compounds. One hundred fungal isolates were recovered and identified by
   molecular analysis in 35 different taxa of 20 genera. Pseudogymnoascus
   sp. 1 and 3, Penicillium sp., Peniophora sp. and Mortierella alpina were
   the most frequent taxa identified. All isolates were cultured to produce
   ethanolic extracts, which were assayed against different target
   organisms to detect antimicrobial (against Escherichia coli,
   Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Candida
   krusei, Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis),
   cytotoxic (against breast MCF-7 and renal TK-10 human tumoral cells) and
   antiprotozoal (against Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi)
   activities. Among the three human pathogenic fungal species, 20 extracts
   showed moderate to high and selective antifungal activity against P.
   brasiliensis. The extract of Purpureocillium lilacinum displayed high
   trypanocidal, antifungal and antibacterial activities, but with moderate
   toxicity over normal cells. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR)
   spectral analysis indicated the presence of compounds containing a
   highly functionalized aromatic ring system. Our results suggest that the
   Antarctic ecosystems represent an interesting habitat for the isolation
   and characterization of fungal taxa capable to producing bioactive
   compounds. The fungus P. lilacinum showed strong trypanocidal and
   antimicrobial activities with moderate toxicity over normal cells, which
   might be used as scaffold for the development of new drugs.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of fungi in soils of the hot deserts and the dry areas of
   the Antarctic and Arctic are described. A number of filamentous fungi
   and yeasts have been documented from both - the hot and cold habitat -
   however, investigations on the abundance and activity of the filamentous
   hyphomycetes isolated are still missing. There is striking evidence that
   many ubiquitous species just survive in hot desert soil by their spores,
   however, without any physiological activity. There is also reasonable
   suspicion that man-made contamination of the Antarctic deserts might be
   the reason for finding a broad distribution of Penicillium and other
   ubiquitous fungi in soil and air. Basidiomycetous yeasts are reported to
   be endemic in the dry valley of Antarctica. Unrivaled conquerors of the
   desert environment are black, microcolonial fungi that are part of the
   epi- and endolithic community in hot and cold arid and semi-arid
   habitats. These fungi are one of the most stress-tolerant eukaryotic
   life forms on Earth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The fungal complexes of the coal mine spoil tips around the settlement
   Barentsburg (Svalbard) were studied. Samples were taken from coal mine
   spoil tips with different ages (formed, 10-years, 30-years and
   50-years). Arctic tundra soils were used as the control. The indicators
   of change were the species composition, diversity level, dominant groups
   of species and isolate density of fungal communities. The harsh arctic
   conditions and the inhospitality of the rock substrate determined the
   relatively low diversity of microfungi. Only 15 species of microfungi
   were identified in the samples from formed spoil tip, while in the
   samples from 50-year-old tip the number of microfungi species increased
   to 29. The average density of microfungi (CFU/g) for all sampling depths
   of the coal mine spoil tips was low. But this indicator increased with
   the age of spoil tips. The density of microfungi isolates also increased
   with depth in the coal mine spoil tips. The composition of the dominant
   species of microfungi changed with the age of the spoil tips increased.
   The convergence of the microfungal complexes of spoil tips and control
   arctic soils indicates gradual increase stability of mycobiota in
   disturbed areas.},

Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Lichens are the symbiotic association of fungi and a photosynthetic
   partner. However, non-phototrophic bacteria are also present and thought
   to comprise an essential part of the lichen symbiosis, although their
   roles in the symbiosis are still poorly understood. In this study, we
   isolated and characterized 110 non-phototrophic bacterial lichen
   associates from thalli of the terricolous lichen Peltigera membranacea.
   The biodegradative and other nutrient-scavenging properties studied
   among selected isolates were phosphate mobilization, biosurfactant
   production and degradation of napthalene and several biopolymers,
   suggesting organic and inorganic nutrient scavenging as roles for
   bacteria in the lichen symbiotic association. Identification by partial
   16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the isolates comprised 18 genera
   within the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes,

Title = {Brazilian research on extremophiles in the context of astrobiology},

Abstract = {Extremophiles are organisms adapted to grow at extreme ranges of
   environmental variables, such as high or low temperatures, acid or
   alkaline medium, high salt concentration, high pressures and so forth.
   Most extremophiles are micro-organisms that belong to the Archaea and
   Bacteria domains, and are widely spread across the world, which include
   the polar regions, volcanoes, deserts, deep oceanic sediments,
   hydrothermal vents, hypersaline lakes, acid and alkaline water bodies,
   and other extreme environments considered hostile to human life. Despite
   the tropical climate, Brazil has a wide range of ecosystems which
   include some permanent or seasonally extreme environments. For example,
   the Cerrado is a biome with very low soil pH with high Al+3
   concentration, the mangroves in the Brazilian coast are anaerobic and
   saline, Pantanal has thousands of alkaline-saline lakes, the Caatinga
   arid and hot soils and the deep sea sediments in the Brazilian ocean
   shelf. These environments harbour extremophilic organisms that, coupled
   with the high natural biodiversity in Brazil, could be explored for
   different purposes. However, only a few projects in Brazil intended to
   study the extremophiles. In the frame of astrobiology, for example,
   these organisms could provide important models for defining the limits
   of life and hypothesize about life outside Earth. Brazilian
   microbiologists have, however, studied the extremophilic micro-organisms
   inhabiting non-Brazilian environments, such as the Antarctic continent.
   The experience and previous results obtained from the Brazilian
   Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) provide important results that are directly
   related to astrobiology. This article is a brief synopsis of the
   Brazilian experience in researching extremophiles, indicating the most
   important results related to astrobiology and some future perspectives
   in this area. Received 29 February 2012, accepted 25 May 2012, first

Title = {Humic substance turnover by bacterial decomposers in the maritime
   Antarctic soil},
Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {63},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Context Soil fungi and bacteria play a crucial role in decomposing soil
   organic matter (SOM) and providing nutrients to terrestrial ecosystems.
   However, in polar environments, their relative contributions to
   decomposition remain unclear.Aims This study aimed to determine whether
   fungi or bacteria contributes more to humic substances (HS)
   decomposition (the largest constituent of SOM) in maritime Antarctic
   soils under controlled laboratory conditions with elevated temperature
   and moisture levels.Methods Soil culturing method was used to select for
   soil microbes that efficiently degrade HS. During culturing at 18
   degrees C for 30 days, Antarctic soils were treated with selective
   antimicrobials to manipulate microbial communities. After culturing, HS
   degradation and bacterial communities were analysed. The effects of soil
   culturing on plant growth were also evaluated using Arabidopsis thaliana
   as a surrogate for Antarctic plants.Key results HS decomposition and
   solubilisation were more pronounced in antifungal-treated soils compared
   to antibacterial-treated soils. Antifungal treatment reduced bacterial
   alpha diversity, altered bacterial composition, and increased the
   abundance of rhizosphere-associated Saccharibacteria. Bacterial growth
   resumed quickly after antibacterial treatment indicating resilience to
   antimicrobials. Soil culturing resulted in a higher water-soluble HS
   fraction, which significantly enhanced the fresh and dry weights of A.
   thaliana.Conclusions Antarctic bacteria exhibit higher degradative
   activity and resilience to antimicrobials compared to fungi, promoting
   HS decomposition and solubilisation. This indicates that bacteria have a
   greater impact on Antarctic soil functioning than fungi.Implications
   These findings highlight the critical role of bacteria in nutrient
   cycling and plant growth in polar ecosystems.},

Title = {Widespread association between the ericoid mycorrhizal fungus
   Rhizoscyphus ericae and a leafy liverwort in the maritime and
   sub-Antarctic},
Journal = {NEW PHYTOLOGIST},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {176},
Number = {2},
Pages = {460-471},
Abstract = {A recent study identified a fungal isolate from the Antarctic leafy
   liverwort Cephaloziella varians as the ericoid mycorrhizal associate
   Rhizoscyphus ericae. However, nothing is known about the wider Antarctic
   distribution of R. ericae in C. varians, and inoculation experiments
   confirming the ability of the fungus to form coils in the liverwort are
   lacking.
   Using direct isolation and baiting with Vaccinium macrocarpon seedlings,
   fungi were isolated from C. varians sampled from eight sites across a
   1875-km transect through sub- and maritime Antarctica. The ability of an
   isolate to form coils in aseptically grown C. varians was also tested.
   Fungi with 98-99\% sequence identity to R. ericae internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS) region and partial large subunit ribosomal (r)DNA sequences
   were frequently isolated from C. varians at all sites sampled. The
   EF4/Fung5 primer set did not amplify small subunit rDNA from three of
   five R. ericae isolates, probably accounting for the reported absence of
   the fungus from C. varians in a previous study. Rhizoscyphus ericae was
   found to colonize aseptically-grown C. varians intracellularly, forming
   hyphal coils.
   This study shows that the association between R. ericae and C. varians
   is apparently widespread in Antarctica, and confirms that R. ericae is
   at least in part responsible for the formation of the coils observed in
   rhizoids of field-collected C. varians.},

   study paper reports the production of cold-active CAT by the strain

   oxygen concentration (DO) 40\%. An effective laboratory technology based
   on changing the oxidative stress level through an increase of DO in the
   bioreactor was developed. The used strategy resulted in a 1.7- and
   1.4-fold enhanced total enzyme activity and maximum enzyme productivity.
   The enzyme was purified and characterized. P. griseofulvum P29 CAT was
   most active at approximately 20 degrees C and pH 6.0. Its
   thermostability was in the range between 5 degrees C and 40 degrees C.},

Abstract = {A total of 969 microbial strains were isolated from soil samples and
   tested to determine their lipolytic activity by employing screening
   techniques on solid and in liquid media. Ten lipase-producing
   microorganisms were selected and their taxonomic identification was
   carried out. From these strains Achremonium murorum, Monascus
   mucoroides, Arthroderma ciferri, Fusarium poae, Ovadendron
   sulphureo-ochraceum and Rhodotorula araucariae are described as
   lipase-producers for the first time. Hydrolysis activity of the crude
   lipases against both tributyrin and olive oil was measured. Heptyl
   oleate synthesis was carried out to test the activity of the selected
   lipases as biocatalysts in organic medium. All the selected lipases were
   tested as biocatalysts in several organic reactions using unnatural
   substrates. Lipases from the fungi Fusarium. oxysporum and O.
   sulphurco-ochraceum gave the best yields and enantioselectivities in the
   esterification of carboxylic acids. F: oxysporum and Penicillium
   chrysogenum lipases were the most active ones for the acylation of
   alcohols without steric hindrance. A. murorum lipase is very useful for
   the esterification of menthol. F: oxysporum and Fusarium. solani lipases
   were very stereoselective in the synthesis of carbamates. (C) 2001

Abstract = {The extreme weather conditions in the Antarctic have exerted selective
   pressures favoring differential features in bacteria to survive this
   untapped environment (i.e., antibiotic molecules). Notably, higher
   chances of antibiotic discovery from extremophiles have been proposed
   recently. Although new organic and environmentally friendly sources for
   helping in the control of plant pathogenic fungi are necessary, the
   information about anti-phytopathogenic applications of extremophile
   microorganisms from untapped environments is limited. In this study, we
   determined the antifungal effect of actinobacterial strains isolated
   from Antarctic soils and sediments. Co-culture inhibition assays and
   Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) determination revealed that all
   Antarctic strains (x28) can inhibit the growth of at least one
   phytopathogenic fungi including Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani,
   Botrytis sp. and Phytophthora infestans. Additionally, new novel
   antagonistic relationships are reported. Our work establishes a
   precedent on Antarctic actinobacteria strains with the capacity to
   produce antifungal compounds, and its potential for developing new
   fungicides or biocontrol agents solving current agriculture problems.},

Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Primary succession and microtopography result in environmental changes
   and are important processes influencing the community assembly of soil
   fungi in the Arctic region. In glacier forefields that contain a series
   of moraine ridges, both processes contribute synchronously to fungal
   spatial diversity. To reveal the synergistic effects of succession and
   microtopography, we investigated the fungal community structure and
   environmental variables in the moraines of the Arklio Glacier, Ellesmere
   Island. The study sites were established at four locations from the top
   to the bottom of the ridge slope within each of the three moraine ridges
   of different post-glacial ages. The location-dependent community
   composition was equally diverse in both the initial and later stages of
   succession, suggesting that successional time could alter the effects of
   microtopography on the fungal community. Moreover, our results suggest
   that fungal communities at different locations follow different
   successional trajectories, even if they have passed through the same
   time lapse. Such a synergistic effect of succession and microtopography
   of moraines does not allow for parallel changes in fungal communities
   among moraines or among locations, suggesting that the moraine series
   contributes substantially to fungal spatial diversity in the glacier
   forefield.},

Abstract = {The Polish Arctowski Station is situated in the maritime Antarctic on
   the western shore of Admiralty Bay and encompasses terrestrial habitats
   which are not permanently covered by ice, in contrast to more than 90\%
   of the island's surface area. Over the past several decades, studies
   exploring the soils of those habitats have revealed a considerable
   diversity of bacteria, filamentous fungi, and, to a lesser extent,
   yeasts; however, characterization of this complex microbiome, especially
   at the molecular level, is still far from satisfactory. The isolates
   were assigned to their respective genera and species based on genetic
   analysis of the D1/D2 and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions of rDNA. In the studied
   soil samples, the most abundant microorganisms belonged to the genera
   Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, and Debaryomyces. Physiological and
   biochemical analysis of Cryptococcus gilvescens (pro tempore Goffeauzyma
   gilvescens) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa showed only a limited level of
   intraspecies diversity. Cellular DNA content and karyotypes were
   determined using flow cytometry and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for
   several selected strains. For the first time, genome size and
   electrophoretic karyotypes were investigated in C. gilvescens (pro tem
   G. gilvescens), Cryptococcus saitoi (pro tem Naganishia globosa),
   Cryptococcus gastricus (pro tem Goffeauzyma gastrica), and Cryptococcus
   albidus (pro tem Naganishia albida). In addition, plate tests showed
   Antarctic yeasts to be a potential source of biotechnologically
   important enzymes. This study in biodiversity, presenting physiological
   and molecular characterization of psychrotolerant yeast strains isolated
   from the soils of western Admiralty Bay, contributes to a better
   understanding of the microbial ecology of this unique ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Oman is a desert country in the south of the Middle East. Springs and
   other water sources that harbor aquatic organisms can be separated by
   hundreds of kilometers. In Oct 2019, we isolated four freshwater aquatic
   fungi (Chytridiomycota) from benthic detritus baited with pine pollen on
   a general nutrient medium near Salalah, Oman. Database queries of nuc
   28S rRNA (28S) and internal transcribed spacer region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2
   (ITS) revealed that one of these strains wasDinochytrium kinnereticum, a
   recently described algal pathogen from the Sea of Galilee. The other
   three strains had low molecular identity to available ITS sequences.
   These unknown strains varied in size and released endogenously swarming
   zoospores through papillae from mature zoosporangia. Zoospore
   ultrastructure was consistent with described species in the
   Rhizophydiales, and molecular phylogenetic results grouped these three
   strains into a clade in the genusRhizophydium. We circumscribe these
   three strains as a sp. nov., thereby expanding the diversity
   withinRhizophydiumdescribed as the new speciesR. jobii. In doing so, we
   provide the first report of Chytridiomycota from Oman.},

Title = {Differing preferences of Antarctic soil nematodes for microbial prey},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {We tested the preferences of three nematode taxa, Geomonhystera villosa,
   Plectus spp. and Teratocephalus spp., extracted from moss at Signy
   Island in the Maritime Antarctic, for two microalgae, three microfungi
   and six heterotrophic bacteria, each also from soils at Signy Island.
   Choice test experiments on water agar medium, in which nematodes were
   enumerated in wells containing microbes at 24 and 48 h, indicated that
   there were differing preferences between nematodes for distinct prey. G.
   villosa was significantly attracted to the alga Chlorella cf.
   minutissima and the fungus Mortierella hyalina, and was more attracted
   to all algae and fungi than either of the other two nematodes. Both G.
   villosa and Teratocephalus spp. were attracted to an actinobacterium.
   Plectus spp. were significantly attracted to the alga Stichococcus
   bacillaris and bacteria with close taxonomic affinities to Arthrobacter
   Pseudomonas and Polaromonas. Experiments using 0.5 mum diameter
   fluorescent beads indicated significantly increased ingestion by
   nematodes in the presence of each of these microbes compared with
   controls, except by Plectus spp. in the presence of S. bacillaris. We
   conclude that complex trophic interactions may occur in apparently
   simple Antarctic soil food webs. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights

Abstract = {The ability of actinomycete strains newly isolated from Antarctic soils
   to produce keratinolytic enzymes during growth on sheep wool waste was
   investigated. The strains which displayed highest keratinase activity
   and identified as Streptomyces flavis 2BG (mesophilic) and Microbispora

   analysis. The addition of starch to the growth medium affected
   keratinase secretion by both strains. After 5 days of cultivation, a
   6-fold increase in keratinase activity of strain 11A was observed in the
   presence of 11 g starch/l and a 9-fold increase in keratinase activity
   of the strain 2BG in the presence of 5 g starch/l. The results obtained
   showed that both newly isolated strains are very promising for effective
   processing of native keratinous wastes. To our knowledge, this is the
   first report of Antarctic actinomycete strains that were able to grow on

Abstract = {The methanolysis of soybean oil to produce a fatty acid methyl ester
   (ME, i.e., biodiesel fuel) was catalyzed by lipase-producing filamentous
   fungi immobilized on biomass support particles (BSPs) as a whole-cell
   biocatalyst in the presence of ionic liquids. We used four types of
   whole-cell biocatalysts: wildtype Rhizopus oryzae producing
   triacylglycerol lipase (w-ROL), recombinant Aspergillus oryzae
   expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL), Candida antarctica
   lipase B (r-CALB), and mono- and diacylglycerol lipase from A. oryzae
   (r-mdlB). w-ROL gave the high yield of fatty acid methyl ester (ME) in
   ionic liquid {[}Emim]{[}BF4] or {[}Bmim]{[}BF4] biphasic systems
   following a 24h reaction. While lipases are known to be severely
   deactivated by an excess amount of methanol (e.g. 1.5 Mequiv. of
   methanol against oil) in a conventional system, methanolysis
   successfully proceeded even with a methanol/oil ratio of 4 in the ionic
   liquid biphasic system, where the ionic liquids would work as a
   reservoir of methanol to suppress the enzyme deactivation. When only
   w-ROL was used as a biocatalyst for methanolysis, unreacted
   monoglyceride remained due to the 1,3-positional specificity of R.
   oryzae lipase. High ME conversion was attained by the combined use of
   two types of whole-cell biocatalysts, w-ROL and r-mdlB. In a stability
   test, the activity of w-ROL was reduced to one-third of its original
   value after incubation in {[}Bmim]{[}BF4] for 72 h. The stability of
   w-ROL in {[}Bmim]{[}BF4] was greatly enhanced by cross-linking the
   biocatalyst with glutaraldehyde. The present Study demonstrated that
   ionic liquids are promising candidates for use as the second solvent in
   biodiesel fuel production by whole-cell biocatalysts. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from
   filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from Antarctic
   ecosystems and to assess its potential antibacterial activity on
   Xanthomonas euvesicatoria and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. passiflorae
   (phytopathogenic bacteria causing diseases in pepper and tomato and
   passionfruit, respectively). Among the 66 crude intracellular and
   extracellular extracts obtained from fungi recovered from soil and 79
   obtained from marine sediment samples, 25 showed the ability to prevent
   the growth of X. euvesicatoria invitro and 28 showed the ability to
   prevent the growth of X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae invitro.
   Intracellular and extracellular extracts from soil fungi inhibited
   around 97\% of X. euvesicatoria and 98\% of X. axonopodis pv.
   passiflorae at 2.1 mg ml(-1). The average inhibition rates against X.
   euvesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae for intracellular and
   extracellular extracts from marine sediments fungi were around 96 and
   97\%, respectively, at 3.0 mg ml(-1). Extracts containing secondary
   metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. euvesicatoria and X.
   axonopodis pv. passiflorae were obtained, containing possible
   substitutes for the products currently used to control these

Title = {Distribution patterns of soil entomopathogenic and birch symbiotic
   ectomycorrhizal fungi across native woodland and degraded habitats in
   Iceland},
Journal = {ICELANDIC AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Pages = {37-49},
Abstract = {In Iceland, extensive afforestation programmes have been initiated,
   often involving the outplanting of nursery seedling stock on eroded
   land. In some areas high seedling mortality, to a large extent due to
   root damage caused by Otiorhynchus spp. larvae, has been reported. Even
   though recent studies have shown that inoculation with entomopathogenic
   and ectomycorrhizal fungi may reduce the effects of Otiorhynchus spp. on
   seedling mortality, information on the occurrence and distribution of
   these key fungal species in Icelandic soils is limited. The present
   study reports findings of a targeted survey on the occurrence and
   distribution of entomopathogenic fungi and birch (Betula pubescens) root
   symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in Icelandic soils from key habitats
   representing birch woodland, heathland and degraded/eroded land.
   Entomopathogenic fungi were isolated from soil by baiting with Tenebrio
   molitor and Galleria mellonella larvae. Identification to species was
   achieved based on standard morphotyping of cultures that included
   conidiophores and conidia. Birch seedling root symbiotic ectomycorrhizal
   fungal distribution in eroded and birch woodland soil was determined
   following baiting with birch seedlings over 9 months and classification
   based on gross morphology. Significant lower frequency and diversity of
   both entomopathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi were detected in soil
   collected from eroded areas compared to soil from vegetated areas (birch
   and heathland). Three species of entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria
   bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae and Isaria farinosa were present in
   soil samples collected from the birch woodland and heathland sites. In
   contrast, no insect pathogenic fungi were found in soil collected from
   the eroded sites. B. bassiana and M. anisopliae were recorded for the
   first time in Iceland. The incidence of mycorrhizal root tips was higher
   on seedlings grown in soil from birch woodland than in soil from eroded
   land and a higher diversity of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was found in
   birch soil. The importance of these findings is discussed in relation to
   afforestation in Iceland.},

Title = {Genomic characterization of three marine fungi, including

Abstract = {Marine fungi remain poorly covered in global genome sequencing
   campaigns; the 1000 fungal genomes (1KFG) project attempts to shed light
   on the diversity, ecology and potential industrial use of overlooked and
   poorly resolved fungal taxa. This study characterizes the genomes of
   three marine fungi: Emericellopsis sp. TS7, wood-associated Amylocarpus
   encephaloides and algae-associated Calycina marina. These species were
   genome sequenced to study their genomic features, biosynthetic potential
   and phylogenetic placement using multilocus data. Amylocarpus
   encephaloides and C. marina were placed in the Helotiaceae and
   Pezizellaceae (Helotiales), respectively, based on a 15-gene
   phylogenetic analysis. These two genomes had fewer biosynthetic gene
   clusters (BGCs) and carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) than
   Emericellopsis sp. TS7 isolate. Emericellopsis sp. TS7 (Hypocreales,
   Ascomycota) was isolated from the sponge Stelletta normani. A six-gene
   phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in the marine Emericellopsis
   clade and morphological examination confirmed that the isolate
   represents a new species, which is described here as E. atlantica.
   Analysis of its CAZyme repertoire and a culturing experiment on three
   marine and one terrestrial substrates indicated that E. atlantica is a
   psychrotrophic generalist fungus that is able to degrade several types
   of marine biomass. FungiSMASH analysis revealed the presence of 35 BGCs
   including, eight non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), six NRPS-like,
   six polyketide synthases, nine terpenes and six hybrid, mixed or other
   clusters. Of these BGCs, only five were homologous with characterized
   BGCs. The presence of unknown BGCs sets and large CAZyme repertoire set
   stage for further investigations of E. atlantica. The Pezizellaceae
   genome and the genome of the monotypic Amylocarpus genus represent the
   first published genomes of filamentous fungi that are restricted in
   their occurrence to the marine habitat and form thus a valuable resource
   for the community that can be used in studying ecological adaptions of
   fungi using comparative genomics.},

   Monacrosporium ellipsosporum and M. cionopagum were the most widely
   distributed trapping hypomycetes while Harposporium anguillulae was the
   most frequently occurring endozoic fungus. All taxa were isolated from
   cultures maintained at 18.5.degree. C but only 5 of these were recorded
   in cultures kept at 7.degree. C. Eight different trapping mechanisms
   were recorded with adhesive knobs being the commonest structure. The
   relationship between fungal taxon and moss species or soil type is
   discussed. Although several species were recorded only in single samples
   M. ellipsosporum appeared associated with calcicolous mosses. M.
   cionopagum and H. anguillulae have comparatively wide ecological
   amplitudes. No nematophagous fungi were isolated from permanently
   saturated moss carpets or from the strongly acidic turf-forming
   Polytrichaceae. The possible importance of these fungi in the energy
   dynamics and their influence on nematode populations of Antarctic
   terrestrial ecosystems is considered.},

Title = {Trace element, rare earth element and trace carbon compounds in

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {892},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Whillans Subglacial Lake (SLW) lies beneath 801 m of ice in the lower
   portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part
   of an extensive and active subglacial drainage network. Here, the
   geochemical characterization of SLW rare earth elements (REE), trace
   elements (TE), free amino acids (FAA), and phenolic compounds (PC)
   measured in lakewater and sediment porewater are reported. The results
   show, on average, higher values of REEs in the lakewater than in the
   porewater, and clear changes in all REE concentrations and select redox
   sensitive trace element concentrations in porewaters at a depth of
   similar to 15 cm in the 38 cm lake sediment core. This is consistent
   with prior results on the lake sediment redox conditions based on gas
   chemistry and microbiological data. Low concentrations of vanillyl
   phenols were measured in the SLW water column with higher concentrations
   in porewater samples and their concentration profiles in the sediments
   may also reflect changing redox conditions in the sediments. Vanillin
   concentrations increased with depth in the sediments as oxygenation
   decreases, while the concentrations of vanillic acid, the more oxidized
   component, were higher in the more oxygenated surface sediments.
   Collectively these results indicate redox changes occurring with the
   upper 38 cm of sediment in SLW and provide support for the existence of
   a seawater source, already hypothesized, in the sediments below the
   lowest measured depth, and of a complex and dynamic geochemical system
   beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
   Our results are the first to detail geochemical properties from an
   Antarctic subglacial environment using direct sampling technology. Due
   to their isolation from the wider environment, subglacial lakes
   represent one of our planets last pristine environments that provide
   habitats for microbial life and natural biogeochemical cycles but also
   impact the basal hydrology and can cause ice flow variations.},

Title = {Victoriomyces antarcticus gen. nov., sp. nov., a distinct

Abstract = {In this study, we propose a new genus, Victoriomyces, with a new
   species, Victoriomyces antarcticus, isolated from soil samples collected
   in Victoria Land, Antarctica. To determine its taxonomic status and
   evolutionary relationships, phylogenetic analysis was performed on DNA
   sequences from the nuclear 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and the second largest
   subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) genes. Victoriomyces antarcticus
   constitutes one well-supported distinct lineage within the
   Cephalothecaceae (family incertae sedis in Sordariomycetes), in which
   the only recognised asexual morphs belong to the genus Phialemonium and
   to Acremonium thermophilum. Victoriomyces antarcticus can be clearly
   distinguished from these taxa by means of DNA sequence analysis and its
   morphological traits that consist in having a Metarhizium-like asexual
   morph, dark red-coloured disk-like structures, immature bodies and the
   production of an intense red pigment in the growth media. Finally, we
   inferred the divergence time of V. antarcticus and the Cephalothecaceae
   using Bayesian analysis and secondary calibration. The holotype of V.
   antarcticus is FBL 165. The ex-type strain has been deposited as MUT
   3686(T) and CCF 6158(T). An additional strain of the species is FBL 577.
   The MycoBank number is MB 823713 for the genus and MB 823714 for the
   species.},

Title = {A distinctive fungal community inhabiting cryoconite holes on glaciers
   in Svalbard},
Journal = {FUNGAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces are ice-cold hot spots of microbial
   diversity and activity but still little is known about their fungal
   inhabitants. We provide the first report of distinctive fungal
   communities in cryoconite debris from three valley glaciers at
   Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Multivariate analysis of terminal-restriction
   fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of rRNA ITS amplicons
   revealed that quite distinct fungal communities were found in cryoconite
   holes compared with soils from adjacent moraine and tundra sites, and
   that communities on glaciers with contrasting ice-surface hydrology also
   differed. Most of the fungi cultured from cryoconite sediment were
   basidiomycetous yeasts or filamentous Ascomycota
   (Helotiales/Pleosporales). The latter included aeroaquatic fungi, such
   as Articulospora and Varicosporium, implying a role for these important
   freshwater decomposers in the carbon dynamics of cryoconite holes.
   Matching of the dominant peaks from T-RFLP analysis to predicted peaks
   of cultured isolates confirmed the abundance of these aeroaquatic fungi
   but also revealed that most of the dominant T-RFLP peaks did not match
   any cultured isolates. Considering the prevalence and endangerment of
   glacial environments worldwide, these findings would suggest that their
   potential as reservoirs of fungal diversity should not be overlooked.

Title = {A novel promising laccase from the psychrotolerant and halotolerant
   Antarctic marine Halomonas sp. M68 strain},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Microbial communities inhabiting the Antarctic Ocean show psychrophilic
   and halophilic adaptations conferring interesting properties to the
   enzymes they produce, which could be exploited in biotechnology and
   bioremediation processes. Use of cold- and salt-tolerant enzymes allows
   to limit costs, reduce contaminations, and minimize pretreatment steps.
   Here, we report on the screening of 186 morphologically diverse
   microorganisms isolated from marine biofilms and water samples collected
   in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) for the identification of new
   laccase activities. After primary screening, 13.4 and 10.8\% of the
   isolates were identified for the ability to oxidize 2,2 `-azino-bis
   (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and the dye azure B,
   respectively. Amongst them, the marine Halomonas sp. strain M68 showed
   the highest activity. Production of its laccase-like activity increased
   six-fold when copper was added to culture medium. Enzymatic
   activity-guided separation coupled with mass spectrometry identified
   this intracellular laccase-like protein (named Ant laccase) as belonging
   to the copper resistance system multicopper oxidase family. Ant laccase
   oxidized ABTS and 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, working better at acidic pHs The
   enzyme showed a good thermostability, with optimal temperature in the
   40-50 degrees C range and maintaining more than 40\% of its maximal
   activity even at 10 degrees C. Furthermore, Ant laccase was salt- and
   organic solvent-tolerant, paving the way for its use in harsh
   conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report concerning the
   characterization of a thermo- and halo-tolerant laccase isolated from a
   marine Antarctic bacterium.},

Pages = {423-516},
Abstract = {The dictyostelids (also called cellular slime molds or social amoebae)
   are among the more abundant and widespread groups of microorganisms in
   terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this fact, they are totally unknown to
   most people, who sometimes confuse the dictyostelids with myxomycetes
   (or plasmodial slime molds). The first dictyostelid (Dictyostelium
   mucoroides) was described by the German Oskar Brefeld in 1869. More than
   180 species are now known, and these organisms have been recorded from
   the high arctic to the subantarctic. The primary microhabitat for
   dictyostelids is the soil/humus layer on a forest floor, but they also
   occur in a number of other microhabitats. The purpose of this paper is
   to provide a comprehensive overview of dictyostelids, including their
   occurrence, distribution, relationships with other organisms, methods
   used for isolation, history of their study, and classification. The
   assemblages of species associated with each major type of ecosystem
   (tropical forest, temperate forest, boreal forest, tundra, grassland,
   savanna, and desert) are described. In addition, the compounds produced
   by dictyostelids and their possible applications are discussed.},

Title = {Proteomic characterization of Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolates from
   polar and temperate regions},

Abstract = {Proteomics has been used extensively in the field of mycology, mainly in
   trying to understand the complex network of protein-protein interactions
   that has been implicated in the molecular functions of fungi. It is also
   a useful tool to compare metabolic differences within a genus. Species
   of Pseudogymnoascus, a genus under the phyla Ascomycota, have been shown
   to play an important role in the soil environment. They have been found
   in both polar and temperate regions and are a known producer of many
   extracellular hydrolases that contribute to soil decomposition. Despite
   the apparent importance of Pseudogymnoascus spp. in the soil ecosystem,
   investigations into their molecular functions are still very limited. In
   the present study, proteomic characterization of six Pseudogymnoascus
   spp. isolated from three biogeographic regions (the Arctic, Antarctic,
   and temperate regions) was carried out using tandem mass spectrometry.
   Prior to proteomic analysis, the optimization for protein extraction was
   carried out. Trichloroacetic acid-acetone-phenol was found to be the
   best extraction method to be used for proteomic profiling of
   Pseudogymnoascus spp. The proteomic analysis identified 2003 proteins
   that were successfully mapped to the UniProtKB database. The identified
   proteins were clustered according to their biological processes and
   molecular functions. The shared proteins found in all Pseudogymnoascus
   spp. (1201 proteins) showed a significantly close relationship in their
   basic cellular functions, despite differences in morphological
   structures. Analysis of Pseudogymnoascus spp. proteome also identified
   proteins that were unique to each region. However, a high number of
   these proteins belonged to protein families of similar molecular
   functions, namely, transferases and hydrolases. Our proteomic data can
   be used as a reference for Pseudogymnoascus spp. across different global
   regions and a foundation for future soil ecosystem function research.},

Abstract = {Purpose The ecological importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
   in plant acquisition of inorganic and organic sources of nitrogen (N) is
   not clear. To improve understanding of the plant N nutrition ecology, we
   tested the effect of intraspecific competition and AMF in plant N source
   use in growth and N acquisition.
   Methods Solidago virgaurea was grown in microcosms in a fully factorial
   experiment under greenhouse conditions. The factors tested were
   intraspecific competition between seedlings and adult plants (yes, no),
   N source (NH4, glycine) and AMF (inoculated with Glomus hoi, not
   inoculated).
   Results When grown separately, non-mycorrhizal seedling growth was
   highest when grown with ammonium, but non-mycorrhizal adults grew best
   with glycine as the sole N source. Mycorrhizal symbiosis with Glomus hoi
   evened out this initial niche partitioning in terms of differences in N
   source use and all mycorrhizal plants grew best with ammonium.
   Competition shaped plant benefit from mycorrhizal symbiosis depending on
   the N source. Competition reduced mycorrhizal growth benefit in
   glycine-grown seedlings, but not in adults. Plant performance did not
   show uniform relationship with delta N-15, but delta N-15 was affected
   by life stage, competition and mycorrhiza.
   Conclusions Plant competition and AMF shape plant N source use. Plant
   and AMF benefit of the symbiosis depend on the N source.},

Abstract = {Antarctica is one of the most inhospitable continents on the planet,
   with lichens and mosses being the most common terrestrial organisms in
   ice-free areas. Antarctica is represented by only two species of
   Angiosperms, Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) and Colobanthus
   quitensis (Kunth) Bartl. (Caryophyllaceae). In this study, we
   characterized fungi isolated from the fresh leaves of this grass
   species. The fungi were isolated from four individual plants from Half
   Moon Island (246 leaf fragments investigated), and seven from King
   George Island-Keller Peninsula (with 111 leaf fragments investigated)
   Antarctica. Neoascochyta paspali, Septoriella elongata, Pyrenophora cf.
   chaetomioides and Alternaria sp. were associated with the plant and
   identified through analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed
   spacer region (ITS) of the rDNA and nuclear ribosomal large subunit rRNA
   gene (LSU) as well as through macro and micro-morphological
   characteristics. The isolates showed higher growth rate ranging from 10
   to 20 degrees C. An interesting result was that the aforementioned fungi
   are already recognized as both plant pathogens and endophytic fungi. The
   results demonstrate that D. antarctica is an interesting fungal source.
   Those species might provide important information about the relationship
   on the endemic Antarctic biota.},

Title = {Antarctic eukaryotic soil diversity of the Prince Charles Mountains
   revealed by high-throughput sequencing},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {112-121},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Studies of Antarctic eukaryotes have been hampered by their
   morphological conservatism, small size and the logistical constraints of
   remote field work, resulting in a deficiency of baseline biodiversity
   information about Antarctic terrestrial environments. The application of
   high throughput sequencing (HTS) in metataxonomic approaches is a
   promising alternative. Here, we apply such HTS approaches to the
   hitherto largely unsurveyed micro-eukaryote fauna of the Prince Charles
   Mountains, East Antarctica. We sequenced 18S rDNA amplicons of twelve
   Antarctic bulk-soil DNA extracts, retrieved from three sampling regions
   (four bulk-soil extracts per sampling region). After isolating
   eukaryotic phylotypes with a stringent filtering approach and initial
   network visualization, we firstly used rarefied data to compare four
   alpha diversity metrics between the three regions. Weighted and
   unweighted inter-sample UniFrac distances were then used for beta
   diversity comparisons among rarefied data. Furthermore, we analysed the
   distribution of the most abundant phylotypes and phylotype groups.
   Lastly, we checked the validity of species-level taxonomic assignments
   using different sets of reference data in conjunction with two different
   taxonomy assignment approaches. Phylotype numbers in un-rarefied data
   compared across regions were lowest for Mount Menzies (73 degrees S;
   3330 m), intermediate at Mawson Escarpment (73 degrees S; 807 m) and
   highest at Lake Terrasovoje (70 degrees S; 173 m), likely due to low
   biological load at the higher latitude and elevation inland sites.
   Analysis of rarefied data was difficult due to low sequence coverage
   particularly from Mount Menzies, but indicated differences in Shannon
   diversity between Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje. PCoA of
   weighted UniFrac distances between samples from Mawson Escarpment and
   Lake Terrasovoje indicated changes in community composition in relation
   to elevation of the sampling locations. The most widespread phylotypes
   were fungal, followed by non-algal protists. Species-level assignments
   included known Antarctic taxa in all sampling regions. We show that HIS
   can provide a rapid survey of the micro-eukaryote fauna to provide
   baseline biodiversity information for remote, harsh, and hitherto
   largely unsurveyed environments in the Prince Charles Mountains. (C)

Abstract = {This study assessed the diversity and distribution of filamentous fungi
   obtained from water sampled from six lakes in the Antarctic Peninsula.
   One hundred and twenty-eight fungal isolates were purified and
   identified by analysis of nuclear rDNA ITS region sequences as belonging
   to 31 fungal different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most
   frequently isolated fungi were Geomyces pannorum and Mortierella sp.;
   these species occurred in six and three of the lakes sampled,
   respectively, and displayed the highest total colony-forming unit per L.
   Different species that have not been found to these lakes and/or had
   adapted to cold conditions were found. In general, the fungal community
   displayed low richness and high dominance indices. The species Cadophora
   cf. luteo-olivacea, Cadophora malorum, Davidiella tassiana, G.pannorum,
   Mortierella cf. alpina and Thelebolus cf. microsporus that were found in
   the lakes in question were also previously found in other cold
   ecosystems, such as Arctic, temperate and Alpine regions. The results of
   this study suggest the presence of an interesting aquatic fungal web,
   including symbionts, weak and strong saprophytes and parasite/pathogen
   fungal species. This aquatic web fungal may be a useful community model
   for further ecological and evolutionary studies of extreme habitats.},

Abstract = {Since the discovery of penicillin, fungi have been an important source
   of bioactive natural products. However, as a specific resource, the
   bioactive potentiality and specificity of fungal metabolites from the
   Antarctic region have had little attention. In this paper, we
   investigated the diversity patterns and biological activities of
   cultivable fungi isolated from soil samples in Fildes Peninsula, King
   George Island, Antarctica. Fungal communities showed low abundance and
   diversity; a total of 150 cultivable fungi were isolated from eight soil
   samples. After being dereplicated by morphological characteristics and
   chemical fingerprints, 47 fungal isolates were identified by ITS-rDNA
   sequencing. We confirmed that these isolates belonged to at least 11
   different genera and clustered into nine groups corresponding to
   taxonomic orders in the phylogenetic analysis. Using two different
   fermentation conditions, 94 crude extracts acquired from the
   abovementioned different metabolite characteristic isolates were
   screened by bioactivity assay and 18 isolates produced biologically
   active compounds. Compared with HPLC-DAD-UV fingerprint analysis of
   culture extracts and standard compounds, two bioactive components
   secalonic acid and chetracins were identified. Our research suggests
   that the abundance and diversity of Antarctic cultivable fungal
   communities exhibit unique ecological characteristics and potential
   producers of novel natural bioactive products.},

   localities of Mawson Base or the Vestfold Hills (Davis Base) is
   described. High microbial populations (from 106 to in excess of 109
   cells g-1 dry soil) were associated with soil contaminated by man or
   animals, soil from beneath a moss bed, or soil from beneath translucent
   quartz pebbles and containing green algae. Lower microbial populations
   (generally between 104-106 cells g-1 soil) were associated with pristine
   soils  lacking an identifiable primary producer. No correlation was
   evident between population density and soil particle size, moisture
   content, pH or salinity as determined by the electrical conductivity
   (E.C.) of soil suspensions, although relationships were evident between
   the components of the microflora and E.C. Microbial groups asssociated
   with low E.C. were chitinolytic bacteria, fungi and green algae; favored
   by high E.C. were halotolerant bacteria. The microflora of
   uncontaminated soils appeared to be dominated by Gram-negative aerobic
   rods (68\% of the total flora) with Moraxella, Acinetobacter and
   Pseudomonas being the most frequently isolated genera. The remaining
   microflora comprised Gram-positive pleomorphic bacteria (mainly
   coryneforms), 13\%; filamentous Gram-negative aerobic rods
   (morphologically akin to Bacillus species), 12\%; and yeasts, 7\%.
   Streptomyces was identified among the dominant microflora of only one
   soil. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were never isolated, although their
   presence was indicated in 40\% of the soils tested by
   acetylene-reduction assay. Anaerobes were not detected in any soil using
   dilution-plate techniques, but were occasionally detected by enrichment
   in semi-solid media. All of 242 isolates obtained at 10.degree.
   incubation were able to grow at 15.degree., 3.3\% failed to grow at
   18.degree. and a further 9.5\% failed to growth at 25.degree.. Of 304
   isolates obtained on one-tenth strength Trypticase-Soy agar (0.05\%
   nutrient concentration), 10\% failed to grow  on the full-strength
   medium. Soils from the vicinity of Mawson or Davis bases contained a
   variety of fungi (Cladosporium, Chrysosporium, Acremonium, Phoma,
   Aureobasidium and Trichoderma species being isolated) in contrast to
   pristine soils, from which only Verticillium was occasionally isolated.},

Abstract = {Growing interest in understanding the relevance of marine fungi to food
   webs, biogeochemical cycling, and biological patterns necessitates
   establishing a context for interpreting future findings. To help
   establish this context, we summarize the diversity of cultured and
   observed marine planktonic fungi from across the world. While exploring
   this diversity, we discovered that only half of the known marine fungal
   species have a publicly available DNA locus, which we hypothesize will
   likely hinder accurate highthroughput sequencing classification in the
   future, as it does currently. Still, we reprocessed >600 high-throughput
   datasets and analyzed 4.9 x 10(9) sequences (4.8 x 10(9) shotgun
   metagenomic reads and 1.0 x 10(8) amplicon sequences) and found that
   every fungal phylum is represented in the global marine planktonic
   mycobiome; however, this mycobiome is generally predominated by three
   phyla: the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Chytridiomycota. We
   hypothesize that these three clades are the most abundant due to a
   combination of evolutionary histories, as well as physical processes
   that aid in their dispersal. We found that environments with atypical
   salinity regimes (>5 standard deviations from the global mean: Red Sea,
   Baltic Sea, sea ice) hosted higher proportions of the Chytridiomycota,
   relative to open oceans that are dominated by Dikarya. The Baltic Sea
   and Mediterranean Sea had the highest fungal richness of all areas
   explored. An analysis of similarity identified significant differences
   between oceanographic regions. There were no latitudinal gradients of
   marine fungal richness and diversity observed. As more high-throughput
   sequencing data become available, expanding the collection of reference
   loci and genomes will be essential to understanding the ecology of
   marine fungi.},

Title = {Accidental transfer of non-native soil organisms into Antarctica on

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {875-891},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems currently include very few non-native
   species, due to the continent's extreme isolation from other landmasses.
   However, the indigenous biota is vulnerable to human-mediated
   introductions of non-native species. In December 2005, four construction
   vehicles were imported by contractors to the British Antarctic Survey's
   (BAS) Rothera Research Station (Antarctic Peninsula) from the Falkland
   Islands and South Georgia (South Atlantic) on board RRS James Clark
   Ross. The vehicles were contaminated with > 132 kg of non-Antarctic soil
   that contained viable non-native angiosperms, bryophytes,
   micro-invertebrates, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, and c. 40,000 seeds and
   numerous moss propagules. The incident was a significant contravention
   of BAS operating procedures, the UK Antarctic Act (1994) and the
   Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1998),
   which all prohibit the introduction of non-native species to Antarctica
   without an appropriate permit. The introduction of this diverse range of
   species poses a significant threat to local biodiversity should any of
   the species become established, particularly as the biota of
   sub-Antarctic South Georgia is likely to include many species with
   appropriate pre-adaptations facilitating the colonisation of more
   extreme Antarctic environments. Once the incident was discovered, the
   imported soil was removed immediately from Antarctica and destroyed.
   Vehicle cleaning and transportation guidelines have been revised to
   enhance the biosecurity of BAS operations, and to minimise the risk of
   similar incidents occurring.},

Abstract = {Bacterial growth at low pressure is a new research area with
   implications for predicting microbial activity in clouds and the bulk
   atmosphere on Earth, and for modeling the forward contamination of
   planetary surfaces like Mars. Here, we describe experiments on the
   recovery and identification of 23 species of bacterial hypobarophiles
   (def., growth under hypobaric conditions of approximately 1-2 kPa) in 11
   genera capable of growth at 0.7 kPa. Hypobarophilic bacteria, but not
   archaea or fungi, were recovered from soil and non-soil ecosystems. The
   highest numbers of hypobarophiles were recovered from Arctic soil,
   Siberian permafrost, and human saliva. Isolates were identified through
   16S rRNA sequencing to belong to the genera Carnobacterium,
   Exiguobacterium, Leuconostoc, Paenibacillus, and Trichococcus. The
   highest population of culturable hypobarophilic bacteria (5.1 x 10(4)
   cfu/g) was recovered from Colour Lake soils from Axel Heiberg Island in
   the Canadian Arctic. In addition, we extend the number of hypobarophilic
   species in the genus Serratia to six type-strains that include S.
   ficaria, S. fonticola, S. grimesii, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, and
   S. quinivorans. Microbial growth at 0.7 kPa suggests that pressure alone
   will not be growth-limiting on the martian surface or in Earth's
   atmosphere up to an altitude of 34 km.},

Abstract = {Cryptoendolithic Antarctic black fungi are adapted to the harshest
   terrestrial conditions as in the ice-free area of the McMurdo Dry
   Valleys. Recently, surviving space simulated conditions proves their
   bewildering extremotolerance. In order to investigate the potential DNA
   damage and their response after UV-B exposition, two strains of
   Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungi, Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 534
   and Cryomyces minteri CCFEE 5187, were irradiated at different UV-B
   doses. Since conventional methods cannot be applied to these organisms,
   the effect on the genome was assessed by RAPD and rDNA amplification PCR
   based assays; the results were compared with the responses of
   Saccharomyces pastorianus DBVPG 6283 treated with the same conditions.
   Results showed that template activity was drastically inhibited in S.
   pastorianus after irradiation. Dramatic changes in the RAPD profiles
   showed after 30 min of exposure while the rDNA amplification of SSU,
   LSU, and ITS portions failed after 30, 60, and 90 min of exposure
   respectively. No alteration was detected in the templates of the
   Antarctic strains where both RAPD profiles and rDNA PCR amplifications
   were unaffected even after 240 min of exposure. The electroferograms of
   the rDNA portions of Cryomyces strains were perfectly readable and
   conserved whilst the analyses revealed a marked alteration in S.
   pastorianus confirming the high resistance of the Antarctic strains to
   UV-B exposure. (C) 2011 British Mycological Society. Published by

Abstract = {Fungi associated with photosynthetic organisms are major determinants of
   terrestrial biomass, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem productivity from
   the poles to the equator. Whereas most fungi are known because of their
   fruit bodies (e.g., saprotrophs), symptoms (e.g., pathogens), or
   emergent properties as symbionts (e.g., lichens), the majority of fungal
   diversity is thought to occur among species that rarely manifest their
   presence with visual cues on their substrate (e.g., the apparently
   hyperdiverse fungal endophytes associated with foliage of plants).
   Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous among all lineages of land plants and
   live within overtly healthy tissues without causing disease, but the
   evolutionary origins of these highly diverse symbionts have not been
   explored. Here, we show that a key to understanding both the evolution
   of endophytism and the diversification of the most species-rich phylum
   of Fungi (Ascomycota) lies in endophyte-like fungi that can be isolated
   from the interior of apparently healthy lichens. These
   ``endolichenic{''} fungi are distinct from lichen mycobionts or any
   other previously recognized fungal associates of lichens, represent the
   same major lineages of Ascomycota as do endophytes, largely parallel the
   high diversity of endophytes from the arctic to the tropics, and
   preferentially associate with green algal photobionts in lichen thalli.
   Using phylogenetic analyses that incorporate these newly recovered fungi
   and ancestral state reconstructions that take into account phylogenetic
   uncertainty, we show that endolichenism is an incubator for the
   evolution of endophytism. In turn, endophytism is evolutionarily
   transient, with endophytic lineages frequently transitioning to and from
   pathogenicity. Although symbiotrophic lineages frequently give rise to
   free-living saprotrophs, reversions to symbiosis are rare. Together,
   these results provide the basis for estimating trophic transition
   networks in the Ascomycota and provide a first set of hypotheses
   regarding the evolution of symbiotrophy and saprotrophy in the most
   species-rich fungal phylum. {[}Ancestral state reconstruction;

Abstract = {Urnula sp. was isolated as an endophyte of Dicksonia antarctica and
   identified primarily on the basis of its ITS sequence and morphological
   features. The anamorphic state of the fungus appeared as a
   hyphomyceteous-like fungus as based on its features in culture and
   scanning electron microscopy examination of its spores. On potato
   dextrose agar (PDA), the organism makes a characteristic fragrance
   resembling peach pie with vanilla overtones. A GC/MS analysis done on
   the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of this organism, trapped by
   carbotrap methodology, revealed over 150 compounds with high MS matching
   quality being noted for 44 of these. Some of the most abundantly
   produced compounds included 4-decene, tridecane, 2-decene (E),
   2-dodecene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, butanoic acid, pentyl ester, and
   1-hexanol,2-ethyl. In addition, vanillin, methyl vanillin, and many
   other fragrant substances were noted including isomenthol, pyrazine
   derivatives, and 3-decanone. In split plate bioassay tests on potato
   dextrose agar (PDA), Botrytis cinerea, Ceratocystis ulmi, Pythium
   ultimum, Fusarium solani, and Rhizoctonia solani were inhibited at
   levels of 24 to 50\% of their normal growth on this medium. Bioreactors
   supporting fungal growth on 50 g of beet pulp waste, using stainless
   steel carbotraps, yielded over 180 mg of hydrocarbon-based products
   collected over 6 weeks of incubation. Similarly, because this organism
   is making one of the largest sets of VOCs as any fungus examined to
   date, producing many compounds of commercial interest, it has enormous
   biotechnical potential. The role of the VOCs in the biology and ecology
   of this endophyte may be related to the antimicrobial activities that
   they possess.},

Abstract = {IntroductionPhytopathogenic fungi are a considerable concern for
   agriculture, as they can threaten the productivity of several crops
   worldwide. Meanwhile, natural microbial products are acknowledged to
   play an important role in modern agriculture as they comprehend a safer
   alternative to synthetic pesticides. Bacterial strains from
   underexplored environments are a promising source of bioactive
   metabolites. MethodsWe applied the OSMAC (One Strain, Many Compounds)
   cultivation approach, in vitro bioassays, and metabolo-genomics analyses
   to investigate the biochemical potential of Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b, a
   strain isolated from Antarctica. Crude extracts from OSMAC were analyzed
   through HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, molecular networking, and annotation. The
   antifungal potential of the extracts was confirmed against Rhizoctonia
   solani strains. Moreover, the whole-genome sequence was studied for
   biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identification and phylogenetic
   comparison. Results and DiscussionMolecular networking revealed that
   metabolite synthesis has growth media specificity, and it was reflected
   in bioassays results against R. solani. Bananamides, rhamnolipids, and
   butenolides-like molecules were annotated from the metabolome, and
   chemical novelty was also suggested by several unidentified compounds.
   Additionally, genome mining confirmed a wide variety of BGCs present in
   this strain, with low to no similarity with known molecules. An
   NRPS-encoding BGC was identified as responsible for producing the
   banamides-like molecules, while phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a
   close relationship with other rhizosphere bacteria. Therefore, by
   combining -omics approaches and in vitro bioassays, our study
   demonstrates that Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b has potential application to
   agriculture as a source of bioactive metabolites.},

Abstract = {Soil bacteria and fungi play key roles in the functioning of terrestrial
   ecosystems, yet our understanding of their responses to climate change
   lags significantly behind that of other organisms. This gap in our
   understanding is particularly true for drylands, which occupy similar to
   41\% of Earth ` s surface, because no global, systematic assessments of
   the joint diversity of soil bacteria and fungi have been conducted in
   these environments to date. Here we present results from a study
   conducted across 80 dryland sites from all continents, except
   Antarctica, to assess how changes in aridity affect the composition,
   abundance, and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi. The diversity and
   abundance of soil bacteria and fungi was reduced as aridity increased.
   These results were largely driven by the negative impacts of aridity on
   soil organic carbon content, which positively affected the abundance and
   diversity of both bacteria and fungi. Aridity promoted shifts in the
   composition of soil bacteria, with increases in the relative abundance
   of Chloroflexi and alpha-Proteobacteria and decreases in Acidobacteria
   and Verrucomicrobia. Contrary to what has been reported by previous
   continental and global-scale studies, soil pH was not a major driver of
   bacterial diversity, and fungal communities were dominated by
   Ascomycota. Our results fill a critical gap in our understanding of soil
   microbial communities in terrestrial ecosystems. They suggest that
   changes in aridity, such as those predicted by climate-change models,
   may reduce microbial abundance and diversity, a response that will
   likely impact the provision of key ecosystem services by global
   drylands.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Antarctic soils are unique from those found nearly anywhere else on
   Earth yet can still harbor a broad diversity of microorganisms able to
   tolerate the challenging conditions typical of the continent. For these
   reasons, microbiologists have been drawn to Antarctica for decades.
   However, our understanding of which microbes thrive in Antarctic soils
   and how they to do so remains limited. To help resolve these knowledge
   gaps, we analyzed a collection of 200 archived Antarctic soils-from
   Livingston Island on the Antarctic Peninsula to Cape Hallett in northern
   Victoria Land. We analyzed the prokaryotic and fungal communities in
   these soils using both cultivation-independent marker gene sequencing
   and cultivation-dependent approaches (microbial isolation), paired with
   extensive soil geochemical analyses. Our cultivation-independent
   analyses indicate that colder, saltier, and drier soils harbor less
   diverse communities of bacteria and fungi, distinct from those found in
   soils with less challenging conditions. We also built a culture
   collection from a subset of these soils that encompasses more than 50
   bacterial and fungal genera, including cold-tolerant organisms, such as
   Cryobacterium and Cryomyces. By directly comparing the diversity of our
   cultured isolates against our cultivation-independent data, we show that
   many of the more abundant Antarctic taxa are not readily cultivated and
   highlight bacterial and fungal taxa that should be the focus of future
   cultivation efforts. Together, we hope that our collection of isolates,
   the comprehensive data compiled from the cultivation-independent
   analyses, and our geochemical analyses will serve as a community
   resource to accelerate the study of Antarctic soil microbes.},

Abstract = {We assessed the diversity of cultivable fungi in the ornithogenic soil
   nests of bird species like Phalacrocorax atriceps, Macronectes
   giganteus, Pygoscelis antarcticus, and Pygoscelis papua in the Antarctic
   islands. From 481 fungi isolated at 15 degrees C, only 50 displayed
   growth at 37 degrees C, and were identified as 14 species of 15 genera.
   Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Rhodotorula
   mucilaginosa were the most abundant species obtained. Fifty taxa grew at
   40 degrees C; displayed haemolytic and phospholipase activities;
   produced tiny spores, capsule, and melanin; showed growth at different
   pH; and showed resistance to amphotericin B. Interestingly, the minimum
   inhibitory concentration of amphotericin B increased by 5-10 fold for
   some A. fumigatus isolates after phagocytosis by amoeba. Our results
   show relations among fungal community compositions present in Antarctic
   ornithogenic soil and their pathogenic risk to humans in vitro. As the
   Antarctica Peninsula is a major region of the planet affected by global
   climate changes, our results, though preliminary, raise concerns about
   the dispersal of potential pathogenic microbes present in Antarctic
   substrates by wild birds, which can fly great distances and spread
   potential pathogens mainly to South America and Oceania. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica present extreme environmental
   challenges. Life is restricted to patchy occurrence of lichens, mosses
   and invertebrates, plus soil microbial communities. Fungi have been
   described in lichen symbioses but relatively little is known about the
   occurrence of free-living soil fungi in the Dry Valleys. A challenge in
   estimating fungal species richness has been the extent to which
   estimates based on either cultivation or environmental DNA reflect the
   active assemblage in cold-arid soils. Here, we describe analysis for
   inland Dry Valleys soil of environmental DNA and RNA (cDNA) to infer
   total and putative metabolically active assemblages, respectively, plus
   cultivation approaches using a variety of laboratory growth conditions.
   Environmental sequences indicated a highly restricted assemblage of just
   seven phylotypes that affiliated phylogenetically within two known
   genera, Helicodendron and Zalerion, plus previously unidentified fungal
   phylotypes. None of the commonly encountered molds and mitosporic genera
   recorded from maritime Antarctic locations were encountered. A striking
   difference was observed in the frequency of recovery for phylotypes
   between libraries. This suggests that both species richness and beta
   diversity estimates based on DNA libraries have the potential to
   misinform putatively active assemblages. Cultivation yielded a
   cold-tolerant Zalerion strain that affiliated with DNA and RNA library
   clones, and a psychrotrophic yeast (Debaryomyces hansenii), which was
   not detected using either culture-independent approach.},

Abstract = {The occurrence and distribution of culturable fungi in Taylor Valley,
   Antarctica was assessed in terms of soil habitat. Soil transects
   throughout the valley revealed differential habitat utilization between
   filamentous and non-filamentous (yeast and yeast-like) fungi. In
   addition, there were significant differences in species distribution
   patterns with respect to soil pH, moisture, distance from marine
   coastline, carbon, chlorophyll a, salinity, elevation and solar inputs.
   Filamentous fungal abundance is most closely associated with habitats
   having higher pH, and soil moistures. These close associations were not
   found with yeast and yeast-like fungi demonstrating that yeast and
   yeast-like fungi utilize a broader range of habitat. An intensive survey
   of the Victoria Land is necessary to gain a better understanding of
   their role in soil functioning and nutrient cycling processes. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Aim Polar and alpine ecosystems appear to be particularly sensitive to
   increasing temperatures and the altered precipitation patterns linked to
   climate change. However, little is currently known about how these
   environmental drivers may affect edaphic organisms within these
   ecosystems. In this study, we examined communities of plant
   root-associated fungi (RAF) over large biogeographical scales and along
   climatic gradients in the North Atlantic region in order to gain
   insights into the potential effects of climate variability on these
   communities. We also investigated whether selected fungal traits were
   associated with particular climates. Locations Austria, Scotland,
   Mainland Norway, Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Taxa Root fungi
   associated with the ectomycorrhizal and herbaceous plant Bistorta
   vivipara. Methods DNA metabarcoding of the ITS1 region was used to
   characterize the RAF of 302 whole plant root systems, which were
   analysed by means of ordination methods and linear modelling. Fungal
   spore length, width, volume and shape, as well as mycelial exploration
   type (ET) of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes were summarized at a
   community level. Results The RAF communities exhibited strong
   biogeographical structuring, and both compositional variation as well as
   fungal species richness correlated with annual temperature and
   precipitation. In accordance with general island biogeography theory,
   the least species-rich RAF communities were found on Jan Mayen, a remote
   and small island in the North Atlantic Ocean. Fungal spores tended to be
   more elongated with increasing latitude. We also observed a climate
   effect on which mycelial ET was dominating among the ectomycorrhizal
   fungi. Main conclusions Both geographical and environmental variables
   were important for shaping root-associated fungal communities at a North
   Atlantic scale, including the High Arctic. Fungal OTU richness followed
   general biogeographical patterns and decreased with decreasing size
   and/or increasing isolation of the host plant population. The
   probability of possessing more elongated spores increases with latitude,
   which may be explained by a selection for greater dispersal capacity
   among more isolated host plant populations in the Arctic.},

Title = {An Antarctic Hot Spot for Fungi at Shackleton's Historic Hut on Cape
   Royds},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {The historic expedition huts located in the Ross Sea Region of the
   Antarctic and the thousands of artifacts left behind by the early
   explorers represent important cultural heritage from the ``Heroic
   Era{''} of Polar exploration. The hut at Cape Royds built by Ernest
   Shackleton and members of the 1907-1908 British Antarctic Expedition has
   survived the extreme Antarctic environment for over 100 years, but
   recent studies have shown many forms of deterioration are causing
   serious problems, and microbial degradation is evident in the historic
   wood. Conservation work to reduce moisture at the hut required removal
   of fodder, wood, and many different types of organic materials from the
   stables area on the north side of the structure allowing large numbers
   of samples to be obtained for these investigations. In addition, wood
   from historic food storage boxes exposed in a ravine adjacent to the hut
   were also sampled. Fungi were cultured on several different media, and
   pure cultures were obtained and identified by sequencing of the internal
   transcribed spacer region of rDNA. From the 69 cultures of filamentous
   fungi obtained, the most predominant genera were Cadophora (44\%)
   followed by Thielavia (17\%) and Geomyces (15\%). Other fungi found
   included Cladosporium, Chaetomium, and isolates identified as being in
   Pezizomycotina, Onygenales, Nectriaceae, and others. No filamentous
   basidiomycetes were found. Phylogenetic analyses of the Cadophora
   species showed great species diversity present revealing Cadophora
   malorum, Cadophora luteo-olivacea, Cadophora fastigiata, as well as
   Cadophora sp. 4E71-1, a C. malorum-like species, and Cadophora sp.
   7R16-1, a C. fastigiata-like species. Scanning electron microscopy
   showed extensive decay was present in the wood samples with type 1 and
   type 2 forms of soft rot evident in pine and birch wood, respectively.
   Fungi causing decay in the historic wooden structures and artifacts are
   of great concern, and this investigation provides insight into the
   identity and species diversity of fungi found at the site. The historic
   woods and other organic materials at this site represent a large input
   of carbon into the Antarctic environment. This as well as nutrient
   additions from the nearby Ad,lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony and
   favorable conditions for fungal growth at Cape Royds appear responsible
   for the significant fungal diversity, and where extensive decay is
   taking place in wood in contact with the ground.},

Title = {Genetic diversity of yeasts from East Ongul Island, East Antarctica and
   their extracellular enzymes secretion},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Microbes growing at low temperatures encounter numerous growth
   constraints. However, fungi that inhabit polar regions can grow and
   decompose organic compounds at low temperatures. Research on the
   biodiversity and secretion ability of yeasts from East Ongul Island, and
   evaluation of their extracellular enzymatic activity at temperatures
   ranging from -3 to 20 A degrees C, was performed and described in this
   study. In total, 95 yeast strains were isolated from the surface soil on
   East Ongul Island, East Antarctica. Based on the internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS) region and 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain sequence similarity, these
   strains were classified into 10 genera and 16 species. All strains were
   categorized as basidiomycetous yeasts. One representative strain was
   selected from each species, and its ability to grow at temperatures
   between -3 and 37 A degrees C was evaluated. Strain abilities to secrete
   extracellular enzymes (lipase, cellulase, and protease) at temperatures
   ranging from -3 to 20 A degrees C were also investigated. Based on the
   optimal and maximal growth temperatures, the yeasts were classified as
   psychrophilic or psychrotolerant. All the strains investigated in this
   study were able to grow at -3 A degrees C and in vitamin-free media.
   Psychrophilic yeasts, such as Glaciozyma antarctica, Gl. martinii,
   Mrakia gelida, and Phenoliferia glacialis, did not secrete pronounced
   amounts of extracellular enzymes at -3 A degrees C; in contrast, the
   psychrotolerant yeasts Goffeauzyma gilvescens, Holtermanniella wattica,
   Tausonia pullulans, and Udeniomyces puniceus secreted copious amounts of
   enzymes, even at subzero temperatures. These results indicated that
   psychrotolerant yeasts, rather than psychrophilic yeasts, play important
   roles in the nutrient cycle in the East Ongul Island ecosystem at
   near-subzero temperatures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {Here we present the first culture-independent microbiological and
   biogeochemical study of the mineral soils from 6000 m above sea level
   (m.a.s.l.) on some the highest volcanoes in the Atacama region of
   Argentina and Chile. These soils experience some of the harshest
   environmental conditions on Earth including daily temperature
   fluctuations across the freezing point (with an amplitude of up to 70
   degrees C) and intense solar radiation. Soil carbon and water levels are
   among the lowest yet measured for a terrestrial ecosystem and enzyme
   activity was near or below detection limits for all microbial enzymes
   measured. The soil microbial communities were among the simplest yet
   studied in a terrestrial environment and contained novel Bacteria and
   Fungi and only one Archaeal phylotype. No photosynthetic organisms were
   detected but several of the dominant bacterial phylotypes are related to
   organisms involved in carbon monoxide oxidation on other volcanoes
   (e.g., Pseudonocardia and Ktedonobacter spp.). Focused studies of a gene
   responsible for carbon monoxide oxidation, the large subunit of carbon
   monoxide dehydrogenase (coxL of CODH), revealed several novel lineages
   and a broad diversity of coxL genes. Overall our results suggest that a
   unique microbial community, sustained by diffuse atmospheric and
   volcanic gases, is barely functioning on these volcanoes, which
   represent the highest terrestrial ecosystems yet studied.},

Journal = {EXTREMOPHILES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {219-225},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We surveyed the diversity of cultivable fungi isolated from cold and hot
   volcanic soils of Deception Island, Antarctica. Seventy-four fungal
   isolates were identified; these belonged to 17 taxa in the genera
   Aspergillus, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, Purpureocillium, and
   Mortierella. The fungal assemblages showed low diversity, richness, and
   dominance indices. The Aspergillus taxa were dominant in the soils at 0
   degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 100 degrees C. Aspergillus lacticoffeatus,
   Aspergillus cf. ruber, Penicillium citrinun, and Purpureocillium sodanum
   were present only in soils having a temperature of 100 degrees C.
   Aspergillus calidoustus was present in all thermal soils and displayed
   the highest densities. The majority of fungi displayed mesophilic
   behavior; however, different isolates of Aspergillus lacticoffeatus and
   Aspergillus niger were able to grow at 50 degrees C; these are
   phylogenetically close to the causative agents of aspergillosis in
   immunocompromised individuals. Deception Island perhaps represents one
   of the most visited regions in Antarctica and the tourism there has
   increased over the last 20 years, especially by elderly tourists,
   probably with weak immune systems, come in contact with the resident
   microorganisms, including the thermo-resistant opportunistic Aspergillus
   species.},

Abstract = {Environmental disturbance is an unpreventable consequence of human
   impact after exploration and research station management in Antarctica.
   Environmental pollution may directly influence Antarctic mycobiota.
   However, information about the effect of anthropogenic factors on
   microscopic fungi at extremely low temperatures is insufficient. This
   work compared the abundance and the species diversity of mycelial fungi
   from soils of six Russian research Antarctic stationsBellingshausen,
   Progress-2, Druzhnaya-4, Molodezhnaya, Novolazarevskaya and
   Oasis-affected by various anthropogenic impacts (operation of tracked
   and wheeled vehicles, storage and use of petroleum products and
   petroleum leakage sites) with that from their background analogues. New
   data were obtained on the taxonomic diversity of mycelial fungi from
   Antarctic soils with different anthropogenic loads. Cultural,
   morphological and physiological studies of 142 isolated strains of
   mycelial fungi were supplemented by molecular-biological research into
   sterile mycelium strains and those with vague morphological characters.
   This contributed not only to the verification but also to a significant
   increase in the number of taxa of mycelial fungi isolated from
   low-temperature ecotopes. Leotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes were found
   to be the most dominant classes in the studied samples. It was shown
   that several ecological groups of micromycetes could be isolated among
   the mycobiota of the investigated habitats, the abundance and species
   composition of which changed differently under the influence of
   anthropogenic factors. The current results highlight that microbiota
   changes in human-affected soils can serve as an indicator of the state
   of low-temperature ecotopes in general.},

   compounds in addition to causing risks to the environment and health,
   its continuous use has given rise to resistant phytopathogens,
   threatening the efficiency of control methods. One alternative for such
   a problem is the use of natural products with high antifungal activity
   and low toxicity. Here, we present the production, isolation, and
   identification of cyclopaldic acid, a bioactive compound produced by
   Penicillium sp. CRM 1540, a fungal strain isolated from Antarctic marine
   sediment. The crude extract was fractionated by reversed-phase
   chromatography and yielded 40 fractions, from which fraction F17 was
   selected. We used 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis in
   DMSO-d6 and CDCl3, together with mass spectrometry, to identify the
   compound as cyclopaldic acid C11H10O6 (238 Da). The pure compound was
   evaluated for antimicrobial activity against phytopathogenic fungi of
   global agricultural importance, namely: Macrophomina phaseolina,
   Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The antifungal assay
   revealed the potential of cyclopaldic acid, produced by Penicillium sp.
   CRM 1540, as a leading molecule against M. phaseolina and R. solani,
   with more than 90\% of growth inhibition after 96h of contact with the
   fungal cells using 100 mu g mL(-1), and more than 70\% using 50 mu g
   mL(-1).},

Abstract = {The analysis of algal-mycological complexes in Albic Podzolic soils
   affected by emissions of the Kandalaksha Aluminum Smelter (KAS) was
   carried out. The number and biomass of microscopic fungi in the maximum
   fluorine-polluted zone (fluorine-content >1000 mg/kg) more than 2 times
   lower than in distanced areas and amounted to 17.3 thousants colony-
   forming units/ g and 1.33 mg/g respectively. Altogether, 31 species of
   soil fungi were isolated. The species Penicillium trzebinskii and P.
   miczynskii dominated the zone of maximum pollution. P. glabrum, P.
   spinulosum, and Memnoniella echinata prevailed in the zones of moderate
   pollution and background. The part of opportunistic fungi in
   contaminated soil increased in comparison with the background soil. The
   reduction of dark-colored fungi biomass in contaminated soil was noted.
   In total, 56 species of eukaryotic algae and 7 species of cyanobacteria
   were found. Among green algae, the species from families Chlorophyceae
   and Trebouxiophyceae dominated in all plots. In the zones of maximum and
   strong contamination, 53 algae species were found including
   xanthophytes, which were absent in unpolluted areas. The number of
   viable cells in the litter of the maximum contaminated soils varied from
   100 thousand to 1.5 million in 1 g of absolutely dry soil. The species
   composition of algae and cyanobacteria in these soils showed the
   characteristic features of the Arctic biological soil crusts.},

Title = {Temporal Changes in Soil Bacterial Diversity and Humic Substances
   Degradation in Subarctic Tundra Soil},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {668-675},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Humic substances (HS), primarily humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA),
   are the largest constituent of soil organic matter. In microcosm systems
   with subarctic HS-rich tundra soil (site AK 1-75; approximately 5.6 A
   degrees C during the thawing period) from Council, Alaska, the HA
   content significantly decreased to 48 \% after a 99-day incubation at 5
   A degrees C as part of a biologically mediated process. Accordingly,
   levels of FA, a putative byproduct of HA degradation, consistently
   increased to 172 \% during an identical incubation process.
   Culture-independent microbial community analysis showed that during the
   microcosm experiments, the relative abundance of phyla Proteobacteria
   (bacteria) and Euryarchaeota (archaea) largely increased, indicating
   their involvement in HS degradation. When the indigenous bacteria in AK
   1-75 were enriched in an artificial mineral medium spiked with HA, the
   changes in relative abundance were most conspicuous in Proteobacteria
   (from 60.2 to 79.0 \%), specifically Betaproteobacteria-related
   bacteria. One hundred twenty-two HA-degrading bacterial strains,
   primarily from the genera Paenibacillus (phylum Firmicutes) and
   Pseudomonas (class Gammaproteobacteria), were cultivated from AK 1-75
   and nearby sites. Through culture-dependent analysis with these
   bacterial isolates, we observed increasing HS-degradation rates in
   parallel with rising temperatures in a range of 0 A degrees C to 20 A
   degrees C, with the most notable increase occurring at 8 A degrees C
   compared to 6 A degrees C. Our results indicate that, although
   microbial-mediated HS degradation occurs at temperature as low as 5 A
   degrees C in tundra ecosystems, increasing soil temperature caused by
   global climate change could enhance HS degradation rates. Extending the
   thawing period could also increase degradation activity, thereby
   directly affecting nearby microbial communities and rhizosphere
   environments.},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {95-114},
Abstract = {Here we investigate the microbiomes of the soil samples from the Yamal
   Peninsula (the surroundings of Salekhard city, Russian Federation) using
   a high-throughput sequencing approach. The main goal was to investigate
   the impact of mining on soils within the following regeneration, both
   during the reclamation practice and natural self-growth. Several
   quarries were studied, engaged in sand, clay and chromatic ores mining.
   The taxonomic analysis of the soil microbiomes revealed 50 bacterial and
   archaeal phyla; among the dominant phyla were: Proteobacteria,
   Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chroloflexi, Gemmatimonadetes,
   Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, AD3, and Nitrospirae.
   Compared to the typical tundra soil, which was chosen as a control, the
   disturbed soils had increased biodiversity and total counts for soil
   bacteria, archaea, and fungi, especially in the cryosolic horizon. The
   different mining strategies caused significantly different
   transformations of soil microbiomes, which was less pronounced for
   self-growth compared to reclaimed quarries. This isolation of the
   reclaimed quarry was mainly associated with the increase of the amount
   of acidobacteria (fam. Koribacteraceae and Acidobacteriaceae and order
   Ellin6513), some proteohacterial taxa (lam. Syntrophobacteraceae), and
   Chlorollexi (fam. Thennogeintnatisporaceae). The study also revealed
   bacteria, which tend to be specific for marine tundra environments:
   gemmatinionadetes from the order N1473WL and Chlorotlexi bacteria from
   the order Gitt-GS-136.},

Abstract = {Antarctic soil represents an important reservoir of filamentous fungi
   (FF) species with the ability to produce novel bioactive lipids.
   However, the lipid extraction method is still a bottleneck. The
   objective of the present work was to isolate and identify cultivable FF
   from Antarctic soils, to assess the most effective methods for fatty
   acid (FA) extraction, and to characterise the obtained lipids. A total
   of 18 fungal strains belonging to the Botrytis, Cladosporium,
   Cylindrobasidium, Mortierella, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, and
   Talaromyces genera and the Melanommataceae family were isolated and
   identified. The Folch, Bligh and Dyer, and Lewis extraction methods were
   assessed, and methyl esters of FA (FAMEs) were obtained. The Lewis
   method was the best in recovering FAMEs from fungal biomass. A total of
   17 FAs were identified, and their chemical compositions varied depending
   on fungal species and strain. Oleic, linoleic, stearic, and palmitic
   acids were predominant for all fungal strains in the three assessed
   methods. Among the analysed strains, Cylindrobasidium eucalypti,
   Penicillium miczynskii, P. virgatum, and Pseudogymnoascus pannorum
   produced high amounts of FA. This suggests that the soils of Antarctica
   Bay, as well as harbouring known oleaginous fungi, are also an important
   source of oleaginous filamentous fungi that remain poorly analysed.},

Abstract = {Filamentous fungi in 36 samples of Antarctic permafrost sediments were
   studied. The samples collected during the Russian Antarctic expedition
   of 20072009 within the framework of the Antarctic Permafrost Age Project
   (ANTPAGE) were recovered from different depths in ice-free oases located
   along the perimeter of the continent. Fungal diversity was determined by
   conventional microbiological techniques combined with a
   culture-independent method based on the analysis of internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS2) sequences in total DNA of the samples. The study revealed
   a rather low fungal population density in permafrost, although the
   diversity found was appreciable, representing more than 26 genera.
   Comparison of the data obtained by different techniques showed that the
   culture-independent method enabled the detection of ascomycetous and
   basidiomycetous fungi not found by culturing. The molecular method
   failed to detect members of the genera Penicillium and Cladosporium that
   possess small-sized spores known to have a high resistance to
   environmental changes.},

Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were extracted from samples of eight
   different sites of sandy soils in Iceland. Eleven species of AMF were
   identified directly from original soil samples or trap culture using the
   host plant Allium porrum. Six AMF species were successfully subcultured
   in pots with the host plant Plantago lanceolata. Species from four
   genera of the order Glomerales (Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Glomus, and
   Scutellospora) were identified. The AMF species identified from
   subcultured pots included Glomus hoi, G. clarum, and a species of
   Scutellospora resembling S. dipurpurascens. Three other, as yet
   unidentified, species of Glomus were also isolated. AMF root
   colonization was estimated on Leymus arenarius (lymegrass), the main
   dune-building grass in Iceland during the growing season. Total AMF root
   colonization did not depend upon the season. However, percentage root
   colonization of arbuscules was significantly highest in July, indicating
   the highest peak of functional AMF activity. This survey of AMF is the
   first conducted in Iceland. The importance of this work is discussed in
   relation to occurrence of AMF species in polar regions and in relation
   to sand dune reclamation.},

Abstract = {Antarctic environments can sustain a great diversity of well-adapted
   microorganisms known as psychrophiles or psychrotrophs. The potential of
   these microorganisms as a resource of enzymes able to maintain their
   activity and stability at low temperature for technological applications
   has stimulated interest in exploration and isolation of microbes from
   this extreme environment. Enzymes produced by these organisms have a
   considerable potential for technological applications because they are
   known to have higher enzymatic activities at lower temperatures than
   their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts. A total of 518 Antarctic
   microorganisms, were isolated during Antarctic expeditions organized by
   the Instituto Antartico Uruguayo. Samples of particules suspended in
   air, ice, sea and freshwater, soil, sediment, bird and marine animal
   faeces, dead animals, algae, plants, rocks and microbial mats were
   collected from different sites in maritime Antarctica. We report
   enzymatic activities present in 161 microorganisms (120 bacteria, 31
   yeasts and 10 filamentous fungi) isolated from these locations.
   Enzymatic performance was evaluated at 4 and 20A degrees C. Most of
   yeasts and bacteria grew better at 20A degrees C than at 4A degrees C,
   however the opposite was observed with the fungi. Amylase, lipase and
   protease activities were frequently found in bacterial strains. Yeasts
   and fungal isolates typically exhibited lipase, celullase and gelatinase
   activities. Bacterial isolates with highest enzymatic activities were
   identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as Pseudomonas spp.,
   Psychrobacter sp., Arthrobacter spp., Bacillus sp. and Carnobacterium
   sp. Yeasts and fungal strains, with multiple enzymatic activities,
   belonged to Cryptococcus victoriae, Trichosporon pullulans and Geomyces
   pannorum.},

Title = {Conifer Root Nodules Colonized by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in

Abstract = {Premise of research. Despite the ecological significance of arbuscular
   mycorrhizae in modern terrestrial ecosystems, knowledge about their
   evolution based on the fossil record is still scarce, especially
   concerning the case of root nodules harboring arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi, as in some extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. Exceptionally
   preserved conifer nodular roots were found in the Jurassic
   fossil-bearing chert deposits of the Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz,
   Argentina), raising the possibility of studying them in association with
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The aim of this study is to describe the
   plant organs and their fungal partners and to discuss the ecological
   significance of the interactions observed, particularly with respect to
   their occurrence in the hot spring settings. Methodology. Thin sections
   of chert samples from the Canadon Nahuel locality of the La Matilde
   Formation, Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz, Argentina) were observed using
   light microscopy. Pivotal results. The cortex of the nodules is occupied
   by several glomeromycotan fungal structures. The structures occur in a
   specific zone of the cortex-toward its center-and include intracellular
   hyphal coils and arbuscules. Glomoid spores and coenocytic hyphae
   possibly penetrating the epidermal cells are also described and
   analyzed. Conclusions. The root nodules have affinities with the
   Araucariales, representing the oldest record of such structures for this
   conifer clade. This is also the first record of nodules harboring
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for the Jurassic; it extends our knowledge
   of the fossil record for this particular type of fungal association.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {The presence of fungi in pristine Antarctic soils is of particular
   interest because of the diversity of this microbial group. However, the
   extreme conditions that coexist in Antarctica produce a strong selective
   pressure that could lead to the evolution of novel mechanisms for stress
   tolerance by indigenous microorganisms. For this reason, in recent
   years, research on cold-adapted microorganisms has increased, driven by
   their potential value for applications in biotechnology. Cold-adapted
   fungi, in particular, have become important sources for the discovery of
   novel bioactive secondary metabolites and enzymes. In this study, we
   studied the fungal community structure of 12 soil samples from Antarctic
   sites, including King George Island (including Collins Glacier),
   Deception Island and Robert Island. Culturable fungi were isolated and
   described according to their morphological and phenotypical
   characteristics, and the richness index was compared with soil chemical
   properties to describe the fungal community and associated environmental
   parameters. We isolated 54 fungal strains belonging to the following 19
   genera: Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, Lambertella, Cadophora, Candida,
   Mortierella, Oxygenales, Geomyces, Vishniacozyma, Talaromyces, Rhizopus,
   Antarctomyces, Cosmospora, Tetracladium, Leptosphaeria, Lecanicillium,
   Thelebolus, Bjerkandera and an uncultured Zygomycete. The isolated fungi
   were comprised of 70\% Ascomycota, 10\% Zygomycota, 10\% Basidiomycota,
   5\% Deuteromycota and 5\% Mucoromycota, highlighting that most strains
   were associated with similar genera grown in cold environments. Among
   the culturable strains, 55\% were psychrotrophic and 45\% were
   psychrophilic, and most were Ascomycetes occurring in their teleomorph
   forms. Soils from the Collins Glacier showed less species richness and
   greater species dominance compared with the rest of the sites, whereas
   samples 4, 7, and 10 (from Fildes Bay, Coppermine Peninsula and
   Arctowski Station, respectively) showed greater species richness and
   less species dominance. Species richness was related to the C/N ratio,
   whereas species dominance was inversely related to C and N content.
   Thus, the structure of the fungal community was mainly related to soil
   chemical parameters more than sample location and altitude.},

Abstract = {Microorganisms play a dominant role in Antarctic ecosystems, yet little
   is known about how fungal diversity differs at sites with considerable
   human activity as compared to those that are remote and relatively
   pristine. Ross Island, Antarctica is the site of three historic
   expedition huts left by early explorers to the South Pole, Robert F.
   Scott and. Ernest Shackleton. The fungal diversity of these wooden
   structures and surrounding soils was investigated with traditional
   culturing methods as well as with molecular methodology including
   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) using the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA for identification.
   From historic wood and artifact samples and soils adjacent to the huts
   as well as soil samples obtained from the Lake Fryxell Basin, a remote
   Dry Valley location, and remote sites at Mt. Fleming and the Allan
   Hills, 71 fungal taxa were identified. The historic huts and associated
   artifacts have been colonized and degraded by fungi to various extents.
   The most frequently isolated fungal genera from the historic woods
   sampled include Cadophora, Cladosporium and Geomyces. Similar genera
   were found in soil samples collected near the huts. Sampling of soils
   from locations in the Transantarctic Mountains and Lake Fryxell Basin at
   considerable distances from the huts and with different soil conditions
   revealed Cryptococcus spp., Epicoccum nigrum and Cladosporium
   cladosporioides as the most common fungi present and Cadophora species
   less commonly isolated. DGGE revealed 28 taxa, not detected by culturing
   including four taxa which possibly have not been previously described
   since they have less than 50\% ITS sequence identity to any GenBank
   accessions. Fungi capable of causing degradation in the wood and
   artifacts associated with the expedition huts appear to be similar to
   those present in Antarctic soils, both near and at more remote
   locations. These species of fungi are likely indigenous to Antarctica
   and were apparently greatly influenced by the introduction of organic
   matter brought by early explorers. Considerable degradation has occurred
   in the wood and other materials by these fungi. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The diversity and phylogenetic relationships of fungi obtained from
   Antarctic soils were analysed using molecular techniques. Direct
   extraction of soil community DNA from two locations, Fossil Bluff (FB)
   and Jane Col (JC), was supplemented with isolation studies. Nucleic
   acids from both the community DNA and the colony extracts were PCR
   amplified using primers specific for the 18S rRNA gene (18S rDNA).
   Amplicons were separated in denaturant gels (DGGE) or following
   endonuclease digestion (ARDRA). Clones presenting unique ARDRA banding
   patterns and unique DGGE bands were sequenced. Comparison of the
   experimental sequences from the different techniques employed with those
   held online resulted in the repeated recovery of a limited range of
   related organisms indicating low species diversity of microfungi in
   these soils. A total of 102 fungal sequences were obtained from FB (37
   sequences) and JC (65 sequences) that together were distributed among
   the Basidiomycota (48 sequences), Ascomycota (48 sequences) and
   Zygomycota (6 sequences). Sequences of the latter were only recovered
   from the JC soils. Phylogenetic comparisons of the experimental
   sequences with those held online have shown high rRNA gene relatedness
   with those obtained from other, less extreme, environments.},

Abstract = {While a vast number of studies have addressed the prokaryotic diversity
   in permafrost, characterized by subzero temperatures, low water
   activity, and extremely low rates of nutrient and metabolite transfer,
   fungal patterns have received surprisingly limited attention. Here, the
   fungal diversity and community structure were investigated by
   culture-dependent technique combined with cloning-restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of sediments in a 10-m-long
   permafrost core from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. A total of 62
   fungal phylotypes related to 10 distinct classes representing three
   phyla were recovered from 5031 clones generated in 13 environmental gene
   libraries. A large proportion of the phylotypes (25/62) that were
   distantly related to described fungal species appeared to be novel
   diversity. Ascomycota was the predominant group of fungi, with respect
   to both clone and phylotype number. Our results suggested there was the
   existence of cosmopolitan psychrophilic or psychrotolerant fungi in
   permafrost sediments, the community composition of fungi varied with
   increasing depth, while these communities largely distributed according
   to core layers.},

Abstract = {The basidiomycetous yeast Moesziomyces antarcticus (often cited as
   Pseudozyma antarctica), originally isolated from a sediment sample
   obtained from Lake Vanda in Antarctica, was asexually typified but
   closely related to the smut fungus Moesziomyces bullatus
   (Ustilaginales). We found a smut fungus on an ovary of barnyardgrass
   (Echinochloa crus-galli) in Japan, which had been identified as M.
   bullatus. The teliospores germinated and formed yeast-like colonies.
   Physiological and phylogenetic studies revealed that the characteristics
   of the yeast-like isolates coincided with those of P. antarctica. We
   thus recognised the smut fungus as the teleomorph of M. antarcticus, and
   then emended the description of M. antarcticus based on the holomorph.
   The identified fungus could degrade certain biodegradable plastics and
   produce mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) in similar qualities as the P.
   antarctica type strain. This discovery provides a significant
   bioresource, as genetically diverse M. antarcticus isolates could be
   obtained from the smut fungus.},

Abstract = {Fungal endophyte associations have been suggested as a possible strategy
   of Antarctic vascular plants for surviving the extreme environmental
   conditions of Antarctica. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs
   are still poorly understood. The role of root fungal endophytes in
   nitrogen mineralization and nutrient uptake, as well as their impact on
   the performance of Antarctic plants, were studied. We tested root
   endophytes, isolated fromColobanthus quitensisandDeschampsia antarctica,
   for lignocellulolytic enzyme production, nitrogen mineralization, and
   growth enhancement of their host plants.Penicillium
   chrysogenumandPenicillium brevicompactumwere identified using a
   molecular approach as the main root endophytes inhabitingC.
   quitensisandD. antarctica, respectively. Both root endophytes were
   characterized as psychrophilic fungi displaying amylase, esterase,
   protease, cellulase, hemicellulase, phosphatase and urease enzymatic
   activities, mainly at 4 degrees C. Moreover, the rates and percentages
   of nitrogen mineralization, as well as the final total biomass, were
   significantly higher in symbioticC. quitensisandD.
   antarcticaindividuals. Our findings suggest that root endophytes exert a
   pivotal ecological role based not only to breakdown different nutrient
   sources but also on accelerating nitrogen mineralization, improving
   nutrient acquisition, and therefore promoting plant growth in Antarctic
   terrestrial ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Space represents an extremely harmful environment for life and survival
   of terrestrial organisms. In the last decades, a considerable deal of
   attention was paid to characterize the effects of spaceflight relevant
   radiation on various model organisms. The aim of this study was to test
   the survival capacity of the cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces
   antarcticus CCFEE 515 to space relevant radiation, to outline its
   endurance to space conditions. In the frame of an international
   radiation campaign, dried fungal colonies were irradiated with
   accelerated Helium ion (150 MeV/n, LET 2.2 keV/mu m), up to a final dose
   of 1,000 Gy, as one of the space-relevant ionizing radiation. Results
   showed that the fungus maintained high survival and metabolic activity
   with no detectable DNA and ultrastructural damage, even after the
   highest dose irradiation. These data give clues on the resistance of
   life toward space ionizing radiation in general and on the resistance
   and responses of eukaryotic cells in particular.},

Title = {Fungal Community in Antarctic Soil Along the Retreating Collins Glacier
   (Fildes Peninsula, King George Island)},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Glacial retreat is one of the most conspicuous signs of warming in
   Antarctic regions. Glacier soils harbor an active microbial community of
   decomposers, and under the continuous retraction of glaciers, the soil
   starts to present a gradient of physical, chemical, and biological
   factors reflecting regional changes over time. Little is known about the
   biological nature of fungi in Antarctic glacier soils. In this sense,
   this work aimed at studying the behavior of fungal community structure
   from samples of glacier soil collected after glacial retreat (Collins
   Glacier). A total of 309 fungi distributed in 19 genera were obtained
   from eleven soil samples. Representatives of the
   generaPseudogymnoascus(Ascomycota) andMortierella(Mortierellomycota)
   were the most abundant isolates in all samples. The data revealed the
   presence of filamentous fungi belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota,
   rarely found in Antarctica. Analysis of the generalized linear models
   revealed that the distance from the glacier as well as phosphorus and
   clay were able to modify the distribution of fungal species.
   Environmental variations proved to have influenced the
   generaPseudogymnoascusandPseudeutorium.},

   content of Humicola marvinii, Geomyces pannororum and Mortierella

   differently to suboptimal growth temperatures. At low temperatures
   Humicola marvinii accumulated cryoprotective carbohydrates (trehalose
   intracellularly and glycerol extracellularly), whereas Geomyces pannorum
   responded by altering its lipid composition with increases in
   unsaturated lipid content and overall unsaturation index. In the case of
   Mortierella elongata, features that may influence its ability to grow at
   low temperatures included the absence of detectable ergosterol, the
   presence of stearidonic acid and increased amounts of intracellular
   trehalose when grown at lower temperatures. The relative importance of
   lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in adaptation to temperature stress in
   these fungi is discussed.},

Title = {Identifying Functional Impacts of Heat-Resistant Fungi on Boreal Forest
   Recovery After Wildfire},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Fungi play key roles in carbon (C) dynamics of ecosystems: saprotrophs
   decompose organic material and return C in the nutrient cycle, and
   mycorrhizal species support plants that accumulate C through
   photosynthesis. The identities and functions of extremophile fungi
   present after fire can influence C dynamics, particularly because
   plant-fungal relationships are often species-specific. However, little
   is known about the function and distribution of fungi that survive
   fires. We aim to assess the distribution of heat-resistant soil fungi
   across burned stands of boreal forest in the Northwest Territories,
   Canada, and understand their functions in relation to decomposition and
   tree seedling growth. We cultured and identified fungi from heat-treated
   soils and linked sequences from known taxa with high throughput
   sequencing fungal data (Illumina MiSeq, ITS1) from soils collected in 47
   plots. We assessed functions under controlled conditions by inoculating
   litter and seedlings with heat-resistant fungi to assess decomposition
   and effects on seedling growth, respectively, for black spruce (Picea
   mariana), birch (Betula papyrifera), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana). We
   also measured litter decomposition rates and seedling densities in the
   field without inoculation. We isolated seven taxa of heat-resistant
   fungi and found their relative abundances were not associated with
   environmental or fire characteristics. Under controlled
   conditions,Fayodia gracilipesandPenicillium arenicoladecomposed birch,
   but no taxa decomposed black spruce litter significantly more than the
   control treatment. Seedlings showed reduced biomass and/or mortality
   when inoculated with at least one of the fungal taxa.Penicillium
   turbatumreduced growth and/or caused mortality of all three species of
   seedlings. In the field, birch litter decomposed faster in stands with
   greater pre-fire proportion of black spruce, while black spruce litter
   decomposed faster in stands experiencing longer fire-free intervals.
   Densities of seedlings that had germinated since fire were positively
   associated with ectomycorrhizal richness while there were fewer conifer
   seedlings with greater heat-resistant fungal abundance. Overall, our
   study suggests that extremophile fungi present after fires have multiple
   functions and may have unexpected negative effects on forest functioning
   and regeneration. In particular, heat-resistant fungi after fires may
   promote shifts away from conifer dominance that are observed in these
   boreal forests.},

Abstract = {We documented relative growth rates (RGRs) and activities of
   extracellular hydrolytic enzymes (EHEs) of one marine-derived tropical
   strain of Fusarium equiseti originally isolated from Malaysia and two
   polar strains of Pseudogymnoascus spp. from the Arctic and Antarctic
   under various temperatures and different nutrient conditions. RGRs and
   relative enzyme activities (RAs) of protease, amylase and cellulase were
   screened in seawater nutrient assay plates augmented with either skim
   milk, soluble starch or carboxymethylcellulose with trypan blue,
   respectively, across culture temperatures between 5 degrees C and 40
   degrees C. Measures of RGR were fitted into third-degree polynomial and
   Briere-2 temperature-dependent models to estimate optimum temperatures
   for growth (T-opt) and maximum growth rates (RGR(max)), and were used to
   calculate temperature coefficients (Q(10)) and activation energies (E-a)
   for growth. All studied strains showed highest RGR and RA when grown
   using a skim milk nutrient assay. T-opt for growth was 25 degrees C in
   F. equiseti and 20 degrees C in Pseudogymnoascus spp. Only F. equiseti
   showed cellulase activity. These data suggest a preference for
   protein-based substrates over plant-derived substrates for metabolism in
   these fungal strains. The tropical F. equiseti could utilise higher
   levels of thermal energy for growth than the polar strains of
   Pseudogymnoascus spp., implying adaptation of these fungi to different
   bioclimatic regions.},

Abstract = {To move beyond targeted approaches to the biochemical characterization
   of psychrophilic yeast and provide a more holistic understanding of the
   chemistry of physiological adaptation of psychrophiles at the molecular
   level, ultraperformance liquid chromatography combined with simultaneous
   acquisition of low- and high-collision energy mass spectra (UPLC/MSe)
   was employed for a preliminary comparative analysis of cell extracts of
   psychrophilic Antarctic yeasts Cryptococcus vishniacii CBS 10616 and
   Dioszegia cryoxerica CBS 10919 versus the mesophile Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae `cry havoc'. A detailed workflow for providing
   high-confidence preliminary identifications of psychrophilic
   yeast-specific molecular features is presented. Preliminary
   identifications of psychrophile-specific features in C. vishniacii and
   D. cryoxerica determined with the described method include the
   glycerophospholipids lysophosphatidylcholine 18:2,
   lysophosphatidylcholine 18:3, lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:3, and
   lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:2. In addition, levels of guanosine
   diphosphate appear significantly elevated in cell extracts of the
   psychrophilic yeasts as compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Finally,
   five psychrophilic yeast-specific peptides have been discovered. All of
   these are demonstrated to be glycine- and/or proline-rich, a known
   structural characteristic of many naturally occurring bioactive
   peptides. The potential of this untargeted metabolite profiling approach
   as a tool for knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation in the study
   of biodiversity and microbial adaptation is highlighted.},

Abstract = {Thirty-three fungal strains, isolated from different sites on Victoria
   Land (continental Antarctica), were plate-screened for their ability to
   produce twelve extracellular enzymes. Lipases were generally present and
   in high quantities in almost all the strains. Polygalacturonase, as well
   as amylase and phosphatase, was common. Glucose oxidase, protease and
   DNAase appeared to be generally low or absent. Many strains, producing a
   limited number of enzymes, appeared to have a low eco-nutritional
   versatility while a few, such as Verticillium cfr. lecanii no. 1, V.
   cfr. lecanii no. 3, Aspergillus versicolor and Phoma sp. no. 2, showing
   a diversified enzymatic competence, are probably advantaged in extreme
   terrestrial environments characterized by low competition. The

Abstract = {Microorganisms were isolated from lignite freshly excavated in the
   Zahorie coal mine (southwestern Slovakia) under conditions excluding
   contamination with either soil or air-borne microorganisms. The isolates
   represented both Prokarya and Eukarya (fungi). All were able to grow on
   standard media, although some microorganisms were unstable and became
   extinct during storage of coal samples. Bacteria belonged to the genera
   Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Rhodococcus, according to both
   morphological criteria and ITS sequences. Several bacterial isolates
   were resistant to antibiotics. The presence of anaerobic bacteria was
   also documented, although they have not yet been identified. Fungal
   isolates were typified by using their ITS sequences. They belonged to
   the genera Trichoderma (Hypocrea), Penicillium, Epicoccum, Metarhizium
   (Cordyceps), and Cladosporium. Several fungi produced compounds with
   antibiotic action against standard bacterial strains. The evidence for
   the presence of microorganisms in native lignite was obtained by means
   of fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electron
   microprobe analysis. Results demonstrated that microorganisms were able
   to survive in the low-rank coal over a long time period. (c) 2005

Abstract = {Endophytic fungi associated with three bryophyte species in the Fildes
   Region, King George Island, maritime Antarctica, that is, the liverwort
   Barbilophozia hatcheri, the mosses Chorisodontium aciphyllum and
   Sanionia uncinata, were studied by culture-dependent method. A total of
   128 endophytic fungi were isolated from 1329 tissue segments of 14
   samples. The colonization rate of endophytic fungi in three bryophytes
   species were 12.3\%, 12.1\%, and 8.7\%, respectively. These isolates
   were identified to 21 taxa, with 15 Ascomycota, 5 Basidiomycota, and 1
   unidentified fungus, based on morphological characteristics and sequence
   analyses of ITS region and D1/D2 domain. The dominant fungal endophyte
   was Hyaloscyphaceae sp. in B.hatcheri, Rhizoscyphus sp. in C.aciphyllum,
   and one unidentified fungus in S.uncinata; and their relative
   frequencies were 33.3\%, 32.1\%, and 80.0\%, respectively. Furthermore,
   different ShannonWeiner diversity indices (0.911.99) for endophytic
   fungi and low endophytic fungal composition similarities (0.190.40) were
   found in three bryophyte species. Growth temperature tests indicated
   that 21 taxa belong to psychrophiles (9), psychrotrophs (11), and
   mesophile (1). The results herein demonstrate that the Antarctic
   bryophytes are an interesting source of fungal endophytes and the
   endophytic fungal composition is different among the bryophyte species,
   and suggest that these fungal endophytes are adapted to cold stress in
   Antarctica.},

Title = {Application of an automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis

Journal = {ANTARCTIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-50},

Abstract = {We utilized an automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA)
   method as a more rapid alternative to classical
   morphological/nutritional identification and a less expensive
   alternative to sequencing for identification and grouping of isolates in
   culture-based fungal abundance studies. This method is well suited for
   the study of culturable Antarctic soil fungal communities where both
   abundance and diversity are relatively low. We optimized template
   concentration and verified the effect of primer selection from eight
   commonly used fungal polymerase chain reaction primers on ARISA
   chromatographs for 46 fungal species commonly isolated from south
   Victoria Land. A database of Antarctic fungal electropherograms was
   produced containing each of the species and was used as the first step
   in a tiered system for species identification. In addition, isolates
   containing more than one species were identified, allowing isolates not
   in the database to be sequenced for further analysis. This method
   unambiguously identified 78\% of the fungal taxa in this study and we
   were able to rapidly determine which isolates should be subjected to
   further analysis by DNA sequencing. Using this approach, the cost of
   analysis for abundance studies can be greatly reduced compared to DNA
   sequencing of each isolate.},

Abstract = {Some of the coldest and driest permafrost soils on Earth are located in
   the high-elevation McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica, but little
   is known about the permafrost microbial communities other than that
   microorganisms are present in these valleys. Here, we describe the
   microbiology and habitable conditions of highly unique dry and
   ice-cemented permafrost in University Valley, one of the coldest and
   driest regions in the MDVs (1700 m above sea level; mean temperature -23
   degrees C; no degree days above freezing), where the ice in permafrost
   originates from vapour deposition rather than liquid water. We found
   that culturable and total microbial biomass in University Valley was
   extremely low, and microbial activity under ambient conditions was
   undetectable. Our results contrast with reports from the lower-elevation
   Dry Valleys and Arctic permafrost soils where active microbial
   populations are found, suggesting that the combination of severe cold,
   aridity, oligotrophy of University Valley permafrost soils severely
   limit microbial activity and survival.},

Abstract = {Iron is the fourth most abundant element on earth. However, its low
   bioavailability is a key plant-growth limiting factor. Bacteria play an
   important role in plant growth promotion since they produce specific
   secondary metabolites that may increase macro- and micronutrient
   accessibility in soil. Therefore, bacterial-derived iron chelators, as
   well as surface-active compounds, are recognised as essential to plant
   welfare. In this study, three cold-active Antarctic bacterial strains,
   i.e. Pseudomonas sp. ANT\_H12B, Psychrobacter sp. ANT\_H59 and Bacillus
   sp. ANT\_WA51, were analysed. The physiological and genomic
   characterisation of these strains revealed their potential for plant
   growth promotion, reflected in the production of various biomolecules,
   including biosurfactants (that may lower the medium surface tension of
   even up to 53\%) and siderophores (including ANT\_H12B-produced
   mixed-type siderophore that demonstrated the highest production,
   reaching the concentration of up to 1.065 mM), increasing the
   availability of nutrients in the environment and neutralising fungal
   pathogens. Tested bacteria demonstrated an ability to promote the growth
   of a model plant, alfalfa, increasing shoots' length and fresh biomass
   even up to 26 and 46\% respectively; while their metabolites increased
   the bioavailability of iron in soil up to 40\%. It was also revealed
   that the introduced strains did not disrupt physicochemical conditions
   and indigenous soil microbial composition, which suggests that they are
   promising amendments preserving the natural biodiversity of soil and
   increasing its fertility.},

Abstract = {A Gram-stain-negative, yellow-pigmented, non-flagellated, gliding,
   rod-shaped, oxidase-negative and catalase-positive bacterium, designated
   SE14(T), was isolated from soil on King George Island, South Shetland
   Islands, Antarctica. Strain SE14(T) grew at 4-25 degrees C (optimum, 20
   degrees C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0-7.5) and with 0-3.0\% NaCl
   (optimum, 1.0-1.5 \%), and could not produce flexirubin-type pigments.
   16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed the the isolate belonged to the
   genus Flavobacterium. Strain SE14(T) had the highest 16S rRNA gene
   sequence similarity to Flavobacterium antarcticum, F. tegetincola and F.
   degerlachei with 95.8, 95.5 and 95.2 \%, respectively. The strain
   SE14(T) consisted of a clade with Flavobacterium noncentrifugens (16S
   rRNA gene sequence similarity 94.9 \%) and F. qiangtangense (16S rRNA
   gene sequence similarity 94.2 \%) and simultaneously formed a distinct
   phyletic lineage in the neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree. Polar
   lipids of the strain included phosphatidylethanolamine and four
   unidentified aminolipids. Strain SE14(T) contained anteiso-C-15 : 0,
   iso-C-15 : 0 and a mixture of iso-C-15 : 0 2-OH and/or C-16 : 1 omega 7c
   as the main fatty acids, and the only respiratory quinone was
   menaquinone-6. The genomic DNA G+C content was 42.3 mol\%. The
   polyphasic taxonomic study revealed that strain SE14(T) belongs to a
   novel species within the genus Flavobacterium, and the name
   Flavobacterium phocarum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SE14(T)
   (=CCTCC AB 2017225(T)=KCTC 52612(T)).},

Title = {Cold-adapted chitinases from Antarctic bacteria: Taxonomic assessment
   and enzyme production optimization},
Journal = {BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Antarctic continent hosts heterogeneous regions, which are in
   general exposed to extreme conditions, mainly low temperatures. Thus,
   microorganisms that thrive in this environment are supposed to harbor a
   metabolic versatility of great biotechnological interest, which includes
   the production of cold-adapted enzymes. The present study aimed to
   investigate chitinase production by bacteria isolated from marine and
   terrestrial samples from the Maritime Antarctica. For this, a collection
   of 560 bacteria was evaluated. Seventy-three (13\%) isolates, belonging
   to 13 bacterial genera affiliated to Proteobacteria (6), Actinobacteria
   (4) and Firmicutes (3), were positive in preliminary assays, and twenty
   strains were further selected based on individual plate assays at 5 and
   15 degrees C. These strains were identified such as Arthrobacter
   psychrochitiniphilus, Arthrobacter cryoconite and Curto bacterium
   luteum, all belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria. The best chitinase
   producer was A. psychrochitiniphilus 492, which showed 43.39 U/L in 80 h
   of incubation. After optimization of nine independent variables by
   Plackett-Burman experimental design, followed by a fractional factorial
   (25-1) and a central composite design (CCD) 23, the best condition for
   chitinase production was achieved using yeast extract 1.0 g/L, NH4NO3
   2.0 g/L, colloidal chitin 5.0\% and initial pH 6.0, which allowed an
   increase of 7.7-fold in chitinase production as compared with the
   initial condition without optimiza tion. Results gathered herein
   reinforce the Antarctic environment as a rich source for chitinase
   prospecting and open perspectives for further optimization strategies
   aiming future biotechnological application of such molecules in
   ecologically-friendly and sustainable processes.},

Abstract = {Evaporitic deposits are a globally widespread habitat for
   micro-organisms. The microbe-mineral environment in weathered and
   remobilized gypsum from exposed mid-Ordovician marine evaporite beds in
   the polar desert of Devon Island, Nunavut, Canadian High Arctic was
   examined. The gypsum is characterized by internal green zones of
   cyanobacterial colonization (dominated by Gloeocapsa/Aphanothece and
   Chroococcidiopsis spp. morphotypes) and abundant black zones, visible
   from the surface, that contain pigmented cyanobacteria and fungi.
   Bioessential elements in the gypsum are primarily provided by
   allochthonous material from the present-day polar desert. The
   disruption, uplift and rotation of the evaporite beds by the Haughton
   meteorite impact 39 Ma have facilitated gypsum weathering and its
   accessibility as a habitat. No cultured cyanobacteria, bacteria and
   fungi were halophilic consistent with the expectation that halophily is
   not required to persist in gypsum habitats. Heterotrophic bacteria from
   the evaporite were slightly or moderately halotolerant, as were
   heterotrophs isolated from soil near the gypsum outcrop showing that
   halotolerance is common in arctic bacteria in this location.
   Psychrotolerant Arthrobacter species were isolated. No psychrophilic
   organisms were isolated. Two Arthrobacter isolates from the evaporite
   were used to mediate gypsum neogenesis in the laboratory, demonstrating
   a potential role for microbial biomineralization processes in polar
   environments.},

Abstract = {We molecularly assesed the ascomycetous fungal communities inhabiting
   the rhizoid environment of Cephaloziella varians, collected at Rothera
   Point on the western Antarctic Peninsula. The RFLP-phenotyped and cloned
   PCR products of a partial small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene were
   sequenced and analyzed with neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony
   (MP). Both analyses identified four bootstrap-supported groups: (i) a
   sister group to Onygenales, (ii) a well-supported clade with
   Phialocephala fortinii, (iii) a large group of clones nested within
   Chaetothyriales, and (iv) a group nested within Eurotiales with a likely
   affinity to the genus Aspergillus. An additional marginally supported
   clade, including helotialean Hymenostyphus fructigenus, was detected in
   the NJ analysis. Placement of one clone (possibly helotialean) was not
   supported by either analysis. We included Hymenoscyphus ericae
   (Helotiales) in our analyses to test for its presence in clone
   libraries. None of our clones showed strongly supported affinity to H.
   ericae. The culture-independent technique proved useful for assessing
   the composition of rhizoid fungal communities, although it remains
   unknown whether any of these fungi colonize C varians tissues.
   Direct-community assays of this kind might be best combined with
   traditional isolation techniques to get a more holistic view of fungi
   occupying plant tissues.},

Abstract = {The ability of four major species of trees of boreal forests, Betula

   protein as a sole nitrogen source was compared when the plants were
   grown in mycorrhizal association with the fungus Hebeloma

   all species used protein N readily, producing vigorous shoots with
   nitrogen contents ranging from 5\% in birch to around 3\% in the
   conifers, and consuming  up to 53\% of the nitrogen provided in the
   culture vessels. In the absence of infection birch, black spruce and
   pine were completely unable to use protein as an N source and Sitka
   spruce had only a minimal ability to do so. It is sugguested that early
   infection by fungi with proteolytic capability may be of particular
   importance for small seeded species germinating in soils of boreal and

Title = {Exogenous addition of alkanoic acids enhanced production of antifungal
   lipopeptides in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Pc3},

Abstract = {The bacterium, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Pc3, was previously isolated
   from Antarctic seawater and has been found to show antagonistic activity
   against the fungus, Rhizoctonia solani ACCC 36316, which causes a severe
   disease known as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in rapeseed plants. Bacillus
   lipopeptides had been widely used as biocontrol agents for plant
   diseases. In this study, we isolated 11 lipopeptide compounds from B.
   amyloliquefaciens Pc3 culture broth via reversed-phase high-performance
   liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and used matrix-assisted laser
   desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to
   identify these as iturin A (C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17), fengycin B (C-14,
   C-15, C-16, C-17), and surfactin (C-14, C-15, C-16). We further found
   that the addition of exogenous alkanoic acids, including myristic acid,
   pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, heptadecanoic acid, octadecanoic
   acid, and nonadecanoic acid, to the bacterial growth media could promote
   lipopeptide production and enhance the antifungal activities of crude
   lipopeptide extracts from B. amyloliquefaciens Pc3. In addition, the
   transcriptional levels of three lipopeptide synthesis genes, ituD, fenA,
   and srfA-A, and two fatty acid metabolism-related genes, FabI, which
   encodes enoyl-ACP reductase, and FadB, which encodes enoyl-CoA
   hydratase, were found to be upregulated in cells grown with exogenous
   alkanoic acids. Among the six alkanoic acids tested, those with odd
   carbon chain lengths had a greater effect on lipopeptide production,
   antifungal activity, and target gene upregulation than those with even
   carbon chain lengths. These results provide a practical approach for the
   efficient production of lipopeptides in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Pc3.},

Abstract = {From undisturbed Antarctic habitats (permafrost sediments 30-150
   thousand years of age, water of Radok Lake) and superficial deposits
   contaminated with petroleum products, we isolated 14 and 9 strains of
   Penicillium fungi, respectively. Comparison of the fungal complexes
   showed them to differ by species composition; only two species-P.
   palitans and P. solitum-were in the species lists of both groups. The
   identified secondary metabolites in the investigated strains belonged to
   diketopiperazine (group of roquefortines, rugulosuvin B), benzodiazepine
   (anacin, cyclopenins), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatins), clavine ergot
   alkaloids (alpha-cyclopiazonic acid, festuclavine, fumigaclavines),
   polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B, chaetoglobosin A), amino acid
   derivatives (N-acetyltryptamine, chrysogins, penicillin G), polyketides
   (citreoviridin A, mycophenolic acid), and terpenes (andrastins,
   phomenone). Strains isolated from anthropogenically altered habitats
   produced a more complete and characteristic profile of exometabolites,
   as compared with strains isolated from undisturbed habitats. It is only
   from contaminated soils there were isolated fungi that produced more
   structurally diverse secondary metabolites pertaining to polycyclic
   indole alkaloids and terpenoids. The fungi isolated from contaminated
   samples can be used in biodegradation of oil spills and bioremediation
   of the environment, and also as producers of promising biologically
   active compounds.},

Abstract = {Various microbial groups are well known to produce a range of
   extracellular enzymes and other secondary metabolites. However, the
   occurrence and importance of investment in such activities have received
   relatively limited attention in studies of Antarctic soil microbiota. In
   order to examine extracellular enzyme production in this chronically
   low-temperature environment, fungi were isolated from ornithogenic,
   pristine and human-impacted soils collected from the Fildes Peninsula,
   King George Island, Antarctica during the austral summer in February
   2007. Twenty-eight isolates of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant fungi
   were obtained and screened at a culture temperature of 4 degrees C for
   activity of extracellular hydrolase enzymes (amylase, cellulase,
   protease), using R2A agar plates supplemented with (a) starch for
   amylase activity, (b) carboxymethyl cellulose and trypan blue for
   cellulase activity or (c) skim milk for protease activity. Sixteen
   isolates showed activity for amylase, 23 for cellulase and 21 for
   protease. One isolate showed significant activity across all three
   enzyme types, and a further 10 isolates showed significant activity for
   at least two of the enzymes. No clear associations were apparent between
   the fungal taxa isolated and the type of source soil, or in the balance
   of production of different extracellular enzymes between the different
   soil habitats sampled. Investment in extracellular enzyme production is
   clearly an important element of the survival strategy of these fungi in
   maritime Antarctic soils.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the ongoing and future space exploration missions
   is the search for traces of extant or extinct life (biomarkers) on Mars.
   One of the main limiting factors on the survival of Earth-like life is
   the presence of harmful space radiation, that could damage or modify
   also biomolecules, therefore understanding the effects of radiation on
   terrestrial biomolecules stability and detectability is of utmost
   importance. Which terrestrial molecules could be preserved in a Martian
   radiation scenario? Here, we investigated the potential endurance of
   fungal biomolecules, by exposing de-hydrated colonies of the Antarctic
   cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus mixed with Antarctic
   sandstone and with two Martian regolith analogues to increasing doses
   (0, 250 and 1000 Gy) of accelerated ions, namely iron (Fe), argon (Ar)
   and helium (He) ions. We analyzed the feasibility},

   systems of the Aldegonda and Bertil glaciers have been studied. The
   biomass of microorganisms varies from 2.54 to 722 mu g/g substrate. It
   is shown for the first time that the major part (78.7-99.8\%) of
   microbial biomass in supraglacial objects is represented by fungi rather
   than by prokaryotes, and the main part (70 to 90\%) of the fungal
   biomass consists of mycelium with the length varying from 6.70 to 537.51
   m/g substrate. The counts of prokaryotes vary from 2.4 x 10(8) to 1.95 x
   10(9) cells/g substrate. The length of actinomycete mycelium falls into
   the range of 2.6-62.61 m/g substrate. The counts of culturable bacteria
   and actinomycetes vary from 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) CFU/g substrate
   and of micromycetes, from 2.2 x 10(1) to 1.7 x 10(4) CFU/g substrate.
   Bacteria of the genera Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces
   and micromycetes of the genera Antarctomyces, Cadophora, Hyphozyma,
   Teberdinia and Thelebolus are dominants. The micromycetes Antarctomyces
   psychrotrophicus, Hyphozyma variabilis and Teberdinia hygrophila are
   found in Svalbard for the first time. The copy number of amoA genes in
   ammonium-oxidizing bacteria varies from 5.33 x 10(6) to 4.86 x 10(9)/g
   substrate; of nitrogen fixation genes nifH, from 9.89 x 10(7) to 9.81 x
   10(10)/g substrate; and denitrification genes nirK, from 4.82 x 10(7) to
   3.34 x 10(10)/g substrate. These results indirectly suggest the leading
   role of fungi in the microbiome of the supraglacial objects in Svalbard
   and a considerable contribution of prokaryotes to the emission of
   greenhouse gases there.},

Abstract = {Juvenile development has been investigated for the first time in an
   Antarctic lichen species-Usnea antarctica-in the northern maritime
   Antarctic, Livingston Island (South Shetland Islands,
   62degrees27'-62degrees48'S, 59degrees45'-61degrees15'W). Here, U.
   antarctica grows on rocks and forms the dominant vegetation on this site
   together with a few other macrolichens. This species reproduces mainly
   by vegetative diaspores (soredia), which include both the photobiont and
   the mycobiont. To understand the early ontogenetic strategies in U.
   antarctica, culture experiments were performed in an Antarctic field
   site where the species occurs naturally. This paper focuses on the
   different developmental steps seen between the initial colonization of
   soredia to the formation of a small well-developed thallus, and also on
   the growth rate of the respective juvenile stages. Compared with growth
   rates of lichens from temperate European regions the early development
   of U. antarctica is extraordinarily slow, taking 5-6 years until an
   adult thallus has been formed. The low photobiont content in the
   juvenile stages probably limits the growth rate. It is suggested that
   juvenile development of U. antarctica is controlled by a combination of
   ecophysiological and morphological adaptations that are required for
   success in extreme environments such as the terrestrial habitats of the
   Antarctic.},

Title = {Tolerance of Rare-Earth Elements in Extremophile Fungus Umbelopsis
   isabellina from Polar Loparite Ore Tailings in Northwestern Russia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUNGI},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {In this study, extremophile fungal species isolated from pure
   loparite-containing sands and their tolerance/resistance to the
   lanthanides Ce and Nd were investigated. The loparite-containing sands
   were collected at the tailing dumps of an enterprise developing a unique
   polar deposit of niobium, tantalum and rare-earth elements (REEs) of the
   cerium group: the Lovozersky Mining and Processing Plant (MPP), located
   in the center of the Kola Peninsula (northwestern Russia). From the 15
   fungal species found at the site, one of the most dominant isolates was
   identified by molecular analysis as the zygomycete fungus Umbelopsis
   isabellina (GenBank accession no. OQ165236). Fungal tolerance/resistance
   was evaluated using different concentrations of CeCl3 and NdCl3.
   Umbelopsis isabellina exhibited a higher degree of tolerance/resistance
   to cerium and neodymium than did the other dominant isolates
   (Aspergillus niveoglaucus, Geomyces vinaceus and Penicillium
   simplicissimum). The fungus began to be inhibited only after being
   exposed to 100 mg L-1 of NdCl3. The toxic effects of Ce were not
   observed in fungus growth until it was subjected to 500 mg center dot
   L-1 of CeCl3. Moreover, only U. isabellina started to grow after extreme
   treatment with 1000 mg center dot L-1 of CeCl3 one month after
   inoculation. This work indicates, for the first time, the potential of
   Umbelopsis isabellina to remove REEs from the loparite ore tailings,
   making it a suitable candidate for the development of bioleaching
   methods.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae, together with bacteria and fungi,
   ale known to be primary colonizers of mineral soils throughout
   Antarctica. Their species diversity and soil coverage were studied in 18
   soil polygons located at Cierva. Point, Antarctic Peninsula. Undisturbed
   assemblages were dominated by filamentous Cyanobacteria and cliatoms,
   whilst almost 40\% of the 49 species recorded were observed only after
   enrichment culture. Nearly all of the isolates from enrichment cultures
   were Chlorophyta and Tribophyceae. This revealed a higher degree of
   complexity than reported for similar communities on Signy Island. Water
   content and concentrations of nutrients were determined at four
   representative sites, and did not appear to account for the large
   inter-polygon variation found in species composition and relative
   frequencies of occurrence. Variables describing community development
   were not significantly correlated with either area of the polygons or
   the minimum distance between them. This suggested that these features
   are not an important short-range barrier to dispersal for those
   ``weed{''} species dominating the community. Conversely, the relative
   frequencies of some of the most common species showed significant
   correlations with species diversity and soil coverage, and it is
   suggested that biotic interactions could account to a larger extent for
   community structure than previously reported from Signy Island
   fellfields.},

Journal = {FUNGAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {125-133},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Numerous studies have recognized a biogeographic boundary (i.e.,
   Blakiston's Line) between Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan, where the Tsugaru
   Strait probably functions as a geographic barrier to the movement of
   terrestrial species. To clarify if this biogeographic boundary applies
   to soil microbes, we examined community structures of ectomycorrhizal
   (EM) fungi across the Tsugaru Strait. We sampled 266 soil cores from six
   conifer-dominated forests, and collected EM roots for fungal species
   identification based on internal transcribed spacer sequences. We found
   that EM fungal communities were primarily influenced by contemporary
   climate, but not significantly by the geographic barrier or spatial
   distance. Fungal OTUs appeared to be widespread in the Holarctic
   regions, suggesting long-distance dispersal capabilities or ancient
   migrations before the separation of Japanese islands from the continent.
   The significant effects of climate in this and previous studies imply
   that EM fungal communities may be sensitive to future climate change.

Abstract = {Mycena s.s. is a ubiquitous mushroom genus whose members degrade
   multiple dead plant substrates and opportunistically invade living plant
   roots. Having sequenced the nuclear genomes of 24 Mycena species, we
   find them to defy the expected patterns for fungi based on both their
   traditionally perceived saprotrophic ecology and substrate
   specializations. Mycena displayed massive genome expansions overall
   affecting all gene families, driven by novel gene family emergence, gene
   duplications, enlarged secretomes encoding polysaccharide degradation
   enzymes, transposable element (TE) proliferation, and horizontal gene
   transfers. Mainly due to TE proliferation, Arctic Mycena species display
   genomes of up to 502 Mbp (2-83 3 the temperate Mycena), the largest
   among mushroom-forming Agaricomycetes, indicating a possible
   evolutionary convergence to genomic expansions sometimes seen in Arctic
   plants. Overall, Mycena show highly unusual, varied mosaic-like genomic
   structures adaptable to multiple lifestyles, providing genomic
   illustration for the growing realization that fungal niche adaptations
   can be far more fluid than traditionally believed.},

Title = {Importation of psychrotolerant fungi to Antarctica associated with

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {The harsh climatic conditions and low levels of human activity in
   Antarctica, relative to other regions, means few non-native species have
   established. However, the risk of introductions is becoming greater as
   human activity increases. Non-native microorganisms can be imported to
   Antarctica in association with fresh food, cargo and personal clothing,
   but the likelihood of their establishment is not well understood. In
   January 2015, a wooden packing crate, heavily contaminated with fungi,
   was imported by aircraft from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Rothera Research
   Station, Antarctica. Mucor racemosus Bull. and two strains of
   Trichoderma viridescens (A.S. Horne \& H.S. Will.) Jaklitsch \& Samuels
   were isolated from the wood. Measurements of hyphal extension rates
   indicated that all three strains were psychrotolerant and capable of
   growth at 4 degrees C, with M. racemosus growing at 0 degrees C. The
   imported fungi could grow at rates equivalent to, or faster than,
   species isolated from Antarctic soils, suggesting that low temperature
   may not be a limiting factor for establishment. It is recommended that
   wood heat-treatment standards, equivalent to those described in the
   International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, are employed
   by national operators importing cargo into Antarctica, and that treated
   wood is adequately stored to prevent fungal contamination prior to
   transportation.},

Abstract = {Dark septate root endophytes (DSE) are an artificial assemblage of fungi
   that have darkly pigmented, septate hyphae and that are frequent or
   distinctive intracellular associates of roots of apparently healthy
   plants. Based oil isolates obtained from the roots of Salix spp., the
   distribution of a common DSE fungus, Phialocephala fortinii, was
   examined along a latitudinal transect in Canada running from the high
   arctic to the 49degrees N parallel. Non-sporulating isolates were
   provisionally identified as P.fortinii through analysis of DNA sequence
   data of the ITS2 region of rDNA. P. fortinii was isolated frequently
   from boreal and arctic habitats, but rarely from grassland habitats.
   Patterns of genetic variation were examined through analysis of
   amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). All AFLP profiles were
   unique with the majority of genetic variation occurring among
   individuals within the collecting sites at each latitude.
   Neighbour-joining analysis of genetic distances yielded eight
   well-supported clusters, three of which included individuals from more
   than one latitude. Some linkage disequilibrium, possibly due to partial
   clonality, was detected.},

Title = {Metabolic response to desiccation stress in strains of green algal
   photobionts (Trebouxia) from two Antarctic lichens of southern
   habitats},
Journal = {PHYCOLOGIA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Number = {6},
Pages = {703-714},
Abstract = {Desiccation tolerance is a feature of most lichens. These symbiotic
   associations of a fungal partner (mycobiont) and a photosynthetic
   partner (photobiont) experience severe desiccation on a regular basis.
   Many lichen species colonise extreme habitats, such as the cold deserts
   of Antarctica. Although the stress physiology of lichens has been
   studied extensively, little is known about the photobionts'
   physiological potential. To assess the contribution of photobionts to
   lichen success in Antarctic terrestrial environments, the photosynthetic
   partners of Umbilicaria decussata (Umbilicariaceae, lichenised
   ascomycetes) and Usnea lambii (Parmeliaceae, lichenised ascomycetes)
   from extreme habitats in southern Antarctica were isolated. Significant
   differences regarding stress tolerance of the two green algae had been
   shown previously despite their close phylogenetic relationship. A deeper
   understanding and explanation of these differences were obtained by
   examination of the metabolite profiles and dynamics, especially the role
   of sugars, polyols and amino acids. High concentrations of ribitol and
   sucrose, among other metabolites, characterised the photobiont of Usnea
   lambii's mainly constitutive strategy of desiccation tolerance. A high
   degree of specialisation to dry environments can be assumed for this
   photobiont.},

Journal = {MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Humicolopsis cephalosporioides is a soil fungus that is associated with
   Nothofagus forests in South America. The aim of this study was to
   analyze the effect of environmental factors such as temperature, light,
   and nutrition on chlamydospore differentiation as well as pigment
   biosynthesis. Temperature did not affect chlamydospore production; it
   rather altered pigmentation development that also was affected by light.
   The composition of culture media as well as light modulated
   chlamydospore differentiation. Microscope observations, spectroscopic
   analysis as well as culture assays, using melanin inhibitors, suggest
   that the main pigment of chlamydospores of H. cephalosporioides is 1,8
   dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin-type compound. Furthermore, we found
   that the genome of H. cephalosporioides contains a sequence highly
   homologous to the pks sequences of other fungi that have been associated
   with the biosynthesis of 1,8 DHN-melanin. All this together suggests
   that melanization is among the most important features linked to
   survival of this fungus in the soils of Nothofagus forests in
   sub-Antarctica region and that the ITS, 18S, and 28S rDNA sequences did
   not provide enough information to delineate the phylogenetic
   relationships of the fungus within the class Leotiomycetes.},

Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},
Year = {1998},

Abstract = {Bradyrhizobia and rhizobia are symbiotic bacterial partners forming
   nitrogen fixing nodules on legumes. These bacteria share characteristics
   with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Nodule inducing
   bacteria, like other PGPR, are capable of colonizing the roots of
   non-legumes and produce phytohormones, siderophores and HCN. They also
   exhibit antagonistic effects towards many plant pathogenic fungi. The
   potential of nodule inducing bacteria to function as PGPR, was examined
   by using radish as a model plant. Three percent of the 266 strains
   tested were found to be cyanogens, while a majority (83\%) produced
   siderophores. Fifty eight percent of the strains produced indole
   3-acetic acid (IAA) and 54\% solubilized phosphorus. Some of the
   bacterial species examined were found to have a deleterious effect while
   others were neutral or displayed a stimulatory effect on radishes.
   Bradyrizobium japonicum strain Soy 213 was found to have the highest
   stimulatory effect (60\%), and an arctic strain (N44) was the most
   deleterious, causing a 44\% reduction in radish dry matter yield. A
   second plant inoculation test, performed in growth cabinets, revealed
   that only strain Tal 629 of B. japonicum significantly increased (15\%)
   the dry matter yield of radish. This indicates that specific
   bradyrhizobia have the potential to be used as PGPR on non-legumes.},

Abstract = {Among the celestial bodies in the Solar System, Mars currently
   represents the main target for the search for life beyond Earth.
   However, its surface is constantly exposed to high doses of cosmic rays
   (CRs) that may pose a threat to any biological system. For this reason,
   investigations into the limits of resistance of life to space relevant
   radiation is fundamental to speculate on the chance of finding
   extraterrestrial organisms on Mars. In the present work, as part of the
   STARLIFE project, the responses of dried colonies of the black fungus
   Cryomyces antarcticus Culture Collection of Fungi from Extreme
   Environments (CCFEE) 515 to the exposure to accelerated iron (LET: 200
   keV/mu m) ions, which mimic part of CRs spectrum, were investigated.
   Samples were exposed to the iron ions up to 1000 Gy in the presence of
   Martian regolith analogues. Our results showed an extraordinary
   resistance of the fungus in terms of survival, recovery of metabolic
   activity and DNA integrity. These experiments give new insights into the
   survival probability of possible terrestrial-like life forms on the
   present or past Martian surface and shallow subsurface environments.},

Abstract = {Preparation of (S)-1-chloro-2-octanol and (S)-1-bromo-2-octanol was
   carried out by the enzymatic hydrolysis of halohydrin palmitates using
   biocatalysts. Halohydrin palmitates were prepared by various methods
   from palmitic acid and 1,2-octanediol. A tandem hydrolysis was carried
   out using lipases from Candida antarctica (Novozym (R) 435), Rhizomucor
   miehei (Lipozyme IM), and ``resting cells{''} from a Rhizopus oryzae
   strain that was not mycotoxigenic. The influence of the enzyme and the
   reaction medium on the selective hydrolysis of isomeric mixtures of
   halohydrin esters is described. Novozym (R) 435 allowed preparation of
   (S)-1-chloro-2-octanol and (S)-1-bromo-2-octanol after 1-3 h of reaction
   at 40 degrees C in {[}BMIM]{[}PF6].},

Abstract = {A new black yeast species, Exophiala macquariensis is described that is
   a member of the ascomycete family Herpotrichiellaceae, order
   Chaetothyriales. The genus Exophiala is comprised of opportunistic
   pathogens isolated from clinical specimens as well as species recovered
   from hydrocarbon contaminated environments. Several species have been
   reported to be able to degrade benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and
   xylenes. Here, a novel species of Exophiala (CZ06) previously isolated
   from a Sub-Antarctic, Macquarie Island soil that was spiked with Special
   Antarctic Blend diesel fuel (SAB) is described. This isolate has the
   capacity of toluene biodegradation at cold temperatures. Multilocus
   sequence typing showed that this fungus was closely related to the
   pathogenic species Exophiala salmonis and Exophiala equina. With the
   capacity to utilise hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source at 10 degrees
   C, this fungus has great potential for future bioremediation
   applications. (C) 2018 British Mycological Society. Published by

Abstract = {To date over 1 000 non-lichenized fungal species have been recorded by
   collection or isolation from Antarctica, and additional taxa are now
   being identified by molecular studies. The number and variety of species
   recorded so far suggest that the fungi may be the most diverse biota in
   the Antarctic, and the additional taxa identified by molecular surveys
   suggest that the true diversity may be far greater than is currently
   estimated. Fungi occupy many different ecological niches in the
   Antarctic, and their significance in these niches is only poorly
   understood. The majority of species described from the region have been
   identified as members of broadly cosmopolitan groups, but there is some
   evidence for both endemic strains and populations. This review brings
   together the current broad systematic and ecological findings for the
   non-lichenized Antarctic fungi. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British

Abstract = {Although investigators have been studying the cold-shock response in a
   variety of organisms for the last two decades or more, comparatively
   little is known about the difference between antioxidant cell response
   to cold stress in Antarctic and temperate microorganisms. The change of
   environmental temperature, which is one of the most common stresses,
   could be crucial for their use in the biotechnological industry and in
   ecological research. We compared the effect of short-term temperature
   downshift on antioxidant cell response in Antarctic and temperate fungi
   belonging to the genus Penicillium. Our study showed that downshift from
   an optimal temperature to 15A degrees or 6A degrees C led to a cell
   response typical of oxidative stress: significant reduction of biomass
   production; increase in the levels of oxidative damaged proteins and
   accumulation of storage carbohydrates (glycogen and trehalose) in
   comparison to growth at optimal temperature. Cell response against cold
   stress includes also increase in the activities of SOD and CAT, which
   are key enzymes for directly scavenging reactive oxygen species. This
   response is more species-dependent than dependent on the degree of
   cold-shock. Antarctic psychrotolerant strain Penicillium olsonii p14
   that is adapted to life in extremely cold conditions demonstrated
   enhanced tolerance to temperature downshift in comparison with both
   mesophilic strains (Antarctic Penicillium waksmanii m12 and temperate
   Penicillium sp. t35).},

Title = {From single pioneers to complex pro- and eukaryotic microbial networks

   Antarctica},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Introduction In the extremely dry and oligotrophic soils of East
   Antarctica, where low temperatures and humidity result in minimal
   biological turnover rates, extracellular DNA (eDNA) can persist over
   extended timescales. Differentiating between sequences from living,
   potentially active cells (intracellular DNA, or iDNA) and those from
   ancient, non-living organisms (eDNA) is crucial for accurately assessing
   the current microbial community and understanding historical microbial
   dynamics.Methods This study was conducted along a chronosequence in the
   Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, where soil samples were collected from
   sites at varying distances from the glacier. By employing DNA separation
   methods, we distinguished iDNA, which represents living cells, from eDNA
   derived from dead organisms. High-throughput sequencing was used to
   characterize bacterial and eukaryotic communities across different
   successional stages.Results The DNA separation approach revealed
   distinct bacterial and eukaryotic community structures along the glacier
   transect. Actinobacteria were consistently abundant across all sites,
   while other phyla such as Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and
   Proteobacteria thrived in extreme, nutrient-poor environments. Early
   successional stages were characterized by the simultaneous colonization
   of green algae Trebouxiophyceae and cryophilic fungi, alongside
   nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which contributed to initial soil development.
   The study also identified three distinct modes of microbial
   distribution, reflecting varying degrees of activity and
   adaptability.Discussion Our findings provide new insights into microbial
   dynamics in extreme habitats and propose new hypotheses for microbial
   colonization in newly exposed soils. Moreover, they contribute to the
   ongoing debate in microbial ecology regarding the viability of dormant
   or dead cells and emphasize the need for refining DNA-based methods and
   exploring functional pathways to deepen our understanding of microbial
   succession in polar regions.},

Title = {Long-term Consequences on Soil Fungal Community Structure: Monoculture
   Planting and Natural Regeneration},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 15},
Abstract = {Understanding the regeneration and succession of belowground
   communities, particularly in forests, is vital for maintaining ecosystem
   health. Despite its importance, there is limited knowledge regarding how
   fungal communities change over time during ecosystem development,
   especially under different forest restoration strategies. In this study,
   we focused on two restoration methods used in northern Japan:
   monoculture planting and natural regeneration. We examined the responses
   of the fungal community to monoculture plantations (active tree
   planting) and naturally regenerated (passive regeneration) forests over
   a 50-year chronosequence, using natural forests as a reference. Based on
   DNA metabarcoding, we assessed the richness of fungal Operational
   Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and their dissimilarity. Our findings revealed
   that soil fungal richness remained stable after natural regeneration but
   declined in monoculture plantations, from 354 to 247 OTUs. While the
   compositional dissimilarity of fungal assemblages between monoculture
   plantations and natural forests remained consistent regardless of the
   time since tree planting, it significantly decreased after natural
   regeneration, suggesting recovery to a state close to the reference
   level. Notably, the composition of key functional fungal
   groups-saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal- has increasingly mirrored that
   of natural forests over time following passive natural regeneration. In
   summary, our study suggests that monoculture plantations may not be
   effective for long-term ecosystem function and service recovery because
   of their limited support for soil fungal diversity. These results
   underscore the importance of natural regeneration in forest restoration
   and management strategies.},

Abstract = {Throughout the history of polar exploration and up to recent times, wood
   and other exotic materials have been brought to the Antarctic continent
   and left there. While the possible transportation of exotic fungal
   species on these materials is sometimes considered, the effects of these
   exotic substrates on indigenous fungal communities have not been
   previously evaluated. This study reports results from seven plots where
   organic materials were used in baiting studies to determine the fungal
   diversity present in soils. Four plots were on islands in the Palmer
   Archipelago on the Antarctic Peninsula and three at Ross Island,
   Antarctica. Samples of sterile wood and cellulose with and without
   nutrients added were buried in soil and left for either two or four
   years before being removed and evaluated for fungal colonization. There
   was a significant increase in fungal colony-forming units (CFU) from
   soil in direct contact with introduced, sterile wood and cellulose
   substrates compared to background soil levels. The type of substrate, 2
   or 4 year incubation period in the field, or nutrient addition did not
   have a significant effect on culturable densities in soil. Fungal
   abundance on soil adhering to substrates was found to be similar to that
   found in non-polar soils indicating that lack of organic material may be
   the most significant limiting factor affecting densities of Antarctic
   fungal populations. Based on a high degree of colonization, these exotic
   substrates appear to have a significant effect on indigenous soil fungal
   abundance.},

Abstract = {Microbial communities in alpine environments >7,500 m.a.s.l. have not
   been well studied using modern cultivation-independent sequencing
   approaches due to the challenges and danger associated with reaching
   such high elevations. For this reason, we know little about the
   microorganisms found in sediments on Earth's tallest mountains, how they
   reach these surfaces, and how they survive and remain active at such
   extreme elevations. Here, we explore the microbial diversity recovered
   from three sediment samples collected from the South Col (similar to
   7,900 m.a.s.l.) of Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) using both culturing and
   next generation sequencing approaches (16S rRNA gene, internal
   transcribed spacer {[}ITS] region, and 18S rRNA gene sequencing). Both
   approaches detected very low diversity of bacteria, protists, and fungi
   that included a combination of cosmopolitan taxa and specialized
   microorganisms often found at high elevations like those of the genera
   Modestobacter and Naganishia. Though we managed to grow viable cultures
   of many of these taxa, it remains likely that few, if any, can be active
   in situ at the South Col. Instead, these high-elevation surfaces may act
   as deep-freeze collection zones of organisms deposited from the
   atmosphere or left by climbers scaling the Earth's highest mountain.},

Abstract = {The ongoing search for effective antiplasmodial agents remains essential
   in the fight against malaria worldwide. Emerging parasitic drug
   resistance places an urgent need to explore chemotherapies with novel
   structures and mechanisms of action. Natural products have historically
   provided effective antimalarial drug scaffolds. In an effort to search
   nature's chemical potential for antiplasmodial agents, unconventionally
   sourced organisms coupled with innovative cultivation techniques were
   utilized. Approximately 60,000 niche microbes from various habitats
   (slow-growing terrestrial fungi, Antarctic microbes, and mangrove
   endophytes) were cultivated on a small-scale, extracted, and used in
   high-throughput screening to determine antimalarial activity. About 1\%
   of crude extracts were considered active and 6\% partially active (67\%
   inhibition at 5 and 50 g/mL, respectively). Active extracts (685) were
   cultivated on a large-scale, fractionated, and screened for both
   antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity. High interest fractions (397)
   with an IC50 < 1.11 g/mL were identified and subjected to
   chromatographic separation for compound characterization and
   dereplication. Identifying active compounds with nanomolar antimalarial
   activity coupled with a selectivity index tenfold higher was
   accomplished with two of the 52 compounds isolated. This microscale,
   high-throughput screening project for antiplasmodial agents is discussed
   in the context of current natural product drug discovery efforts.},

Title = {Endolithic Fungal Diversity in Antarctic Oligocene Rock Samples Explored
   Using DNA Metabarcoding},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary We investigated the environmental DNA fungal diversity
   present in cores of Oligocene rocks from Antarctica using a DNA
   metabarcoding approach. After eDNA extraction and analysis, we
   identified 198 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing the phyla
   Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota,
   Mucoromycota, Rozellomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Monoblepharomycota,
   Zoopagomycota, Aphelidiomycota (Fungi), and the fungal-like Oomycota
   (Stramenopila). The dominant taxa detected were Pseudogymnoascus
   pannorum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp.,
   Aspergillaceae sp., and Diaporthaceae sp. We also detected 22 fungal
   ASVs as intermediate and 170 as minor components of the assigned fungal
   diversity. The samples displayed a high fungal diversity; however,
   rarefaction analysis suggested that further diversity remains to be
   detected. The endolithic fungal community detected contains a rich and
   complex mycobiome comprising taxa with different lifestyles, comparable
   to the diversity reported in other Antarctic habitats. Our results
   suggest the need for further research to develop strategies for
   isolating these fungi into culture for evolutionary, physiological, and
   biogeochemical studies, and to assess their potential roles in
   biotechnological applications.Abstract In this study, we evaluated the
   fungal diversity present associated with cores of Oligocene rocks using
   a DNA metabarcoding approach. We detected 940,969 DNA reads grouped into
   198 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing the phyla Ascomycota,
   Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycota,
   Rozellomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Zoopagomycota,
   Aphelidiomycota (Fungi) and the fungal-like Oomycota (Stramenopila), in
   rank abundance order. Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Penicillium sp.,
   Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Aspergillaceae sp. and Diaporthaceae
   sp. were assessed to be dominant taxa, with 22 fungal ASVs displaying
   intermediate abundance and 170 being minor components of the assigned
   fungal diversity. The data obtained displayed high diversity indices,
   while rarefaction indicated that the majority of the diversity was
   detected. However, the diversity indices varied between the cores
   analysed. The endolithic fungal community detected using a metabarcoding
   approach in the Oligocene rock samples examined contains a rich and
   complex mycobiome comprising taxa with different lifestyles, comparable
   with the diversity reported in recent studies of a range of Antarctic
   habitats. Due to the high fungal diversity detected, our results suggest
   the necessity of further research to develop strategies to isolate these
   fungi in culture for evolutionary, physiological, and biogeochemical
   studies, and to assess their potential role in biotechnological
   applications.},

Title = {Structural and functional characterization of cold-active sialidase
   isolated from Antarctic fungus Penicillium griseofulvum
   P29},
Journal = {BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS REPORTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The fungal strain, Penicillium griseofulvum P29, isolated from a soil
   sample taken from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, was found to be a good
   producer of sialidase (P29). The present study was focused on the
   purification and structural characterization of the enzyme. P29 enzyme
   was purified using a Q-Sepharose column and fast performance liquid
   chromatography separation on a Mono Q column. The determined molecular
   mass of the purified enzyme of 40 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 39924.40 Da by
   matrix desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis
   correlated well with the calculated mass (39903.75 kDa) from the amino
   acid sequence of the enzyme. P29 sialidase shows a temperature optimum
   of 37 degrees C and low-temperature stability, confirming its
   cold-active nature. The enzyme is more active towards alpha(2 -> 3)
   sialyl linkages than those containing alpha(2 -> 6) linkages.Based on
   the determined amino acid sequence and 3D structural modeling, a 3D
   model of P29 sialidase was presented, and the properties of the enzyme
   were explained. The conformational stability of the enzyme was followed
   by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the new enzyme was found to be
   conformationally stable in the neutral pH range of pH 6 to pH 9. In
   addition, the enzyme was more stable in an alkaline environment than in
   an acidic environment. The purified cold-active enzyme is the only
   sialidase produced and characterized from Antarctic fungi to date.},

Abstract = {We recovered 85 fungal isolates from the acid sulphate soils in
   chronosequence under para-periglacial conditions in King George Island,
   Antarctica. Thirty-two taxa belonging to the
   phylumAscomycota,BasidiomycotaandMortierellomycotawere
   identified.Mortierella amoeboidea,Mortierellasp. 2,Mortierellasp.
   3,Penicilliumsp. 2 andPenicilliumsp. 3 dominated the sulphite soils.
   Despite the multi-extreme physic-chemical conditions of the sulphate
   soils (low pH, variable content of macro and micronutrients and organic
   matter), the fungal assemblages exhibited moderate diversity indices,
   which ranged according to the degree of soil development. Soils with
   more weathered and, consequently, with highest values of organic carbon
   shelter the most diverse fungal assemblages, which can be associated
   with the occurrence of sulphurisation and sulphide oxidation. Different
   taxa ofMortierellaandPenicilliumdisplayed broad pH (3-9) and temperature
   (5-35 degrees C) plasticity. The multi-extreme sulphite soils of
   Antarctica revealed the presence of moderate fungal diversity comprising
   cold cosmopolitan and psychrophilic endemic taxa. Among
   these,MortierellaandPenicillium, known to survive in extreme conditions
   such as low temperature and available organic matter, low pH and high
   concentrations of metals, might represent interesting techniques to be
   used in biotechnological processes such as bioleaching in metallurgy and
   phosphate solubilisation in agriculture.},

Abstract = {Molecular biology techniques were used to identify 218 fungi from soil
   samples collected from four islands of Antarctica. These consisted of 22
   taxa of 15 different genera belonging to the Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and
   Basidiomycota. Mortierella, Antarctomyces, Pseudogymnoascus, and
   Penicillium were the most frequently isolated genera and Penicillium
   tardochrysogenum, Penicillium verrucosus, Goffeauzyma gilvescens, and
   Mortierella sp. 2 the most abundant taxa. All fungal isolates were
   cultivated using solid-state fermentation to obtain their crude
   extracts. Pseudogymnoascus destructans, Mortierella parvispora, and
   Penicillium chrysogenum displayed antiparasitic activities, whilst
   extracts of P. destructans, Mortierella amoeboidea, Mortierella sp. 3,
   and P. tardochrysogenum showed herbicidal activities. Reported as
   pathogenic for bats, different isolates of P. destructans exhibited
   trypanocidal activities and herbicidal activity, and may be a source of
   bioactive molecules to be considered for chemotherapy against neglected
   tropical diseases. The abundant presence of P. destructans in soils of
   the four islands gives evidence supporting that soils in the Antarctic
   Peninsula constitute a natural source of strains of this genus,
   including some P. destructans strains that are phylogenetically close to
   those that infect bats in North America and Europe/Palearctic Asia.},

Title = {Diversity and bioprospection of fungal community present in oligotrophic

Journal = {EXTREMOPHILES},

Volume = {19},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We surveyed the diversity and capability of producing bioactive
   compounds from a cultivable fungal community isolated from oligotrophic
   soil of continental Antarctica. A total of 115 fungal isolates were
   obtained and identified in 11 taxa of Aspergillus, Debaryomyces,
   Cladosporium, Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium and Hypocreales. The fungal
   community showed low diversity and richness, and high dominance indices.
   The extracts of Aspergillus sydowii, Penicillium allii-sativi,
   Penicillium brevicompactum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium
   rubens possess antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antitumoral,
   herbicidal and antiprotozoal activities. Bioactive extracts were
   examined using H-1 NMR spectroscopy and detected the presence of
   secondary metabolites with chemical shifts. Our results show that the
   fungi present in cold-oligotrophic soil from Antarctica included few
   dominant species, which may have important implications for
   understanding eukaryotic survival in cold-arid oligotrophic soils. We
   hypothesize that detailed further investigations may provide a greater
   understanding of the evolution of Antarctic fungi and their
   relationships with other organisms described in that region.
   Additionally, different wild pristine bioactive fungal isolates found in
   continental Antarctic soil may represent a unique source to discover
   prototype molecules for use in drug and biopesticide discovery studies.},

Abstract = {Unicellular fungi, commonly referred to as yeasts, were found to be
   components of the culturable soil fungal population in Taylor Valley,
   Mt. Discovery, Wright Valley, and two mountain peaks of South Victoria
   Land, Antarctica. Samples were taken from sites spanning a diversity of
   soil habitats that were not directly associated with vertebrate
   activity. A large proportion of yeasts isolated in this study were
   basidiomycetous species (89\%), of which 43\% may represent undescribed
   species, demonstrating that culturable yeasts remain incompletely
   described in these polar desert soils. Cryptococcus species represented
   the most often isolated genus (33\%) followed by Leucosporidium (22\%).
   Principle component analysis and multiple linear regression using
   stepwise selection was used to model the relation between abiotic
   variables (principle component 1 and principle component 2 scores) and
   yeast biodiversity (the number of species present at a given site).
   These analyses identified soil pH and electrical conductivity as
   significant predictors of yeast biodiversity. Species-specific PCR
   primers were designed to rapidly discriminate among the Dioszegia and
   Leucosporidium species collected in this study.},

Abstract = {In the present study, 10 soil samples were collected aseptically from an
   equal number of areas of the Antarctic in the zone occupied by the
   1986-1987 Italian expedition for research on keratinophilic fungi. Of
   particular interest was the isolation of a pathogenic fungus,
   Microsporum gypseum, from two sites in the base camp occupied by man and
   by skuas. Trichophyton terrestre was isolated from a site in which
   people worked and through which penguins and skuas passed. The most
   widespread fungal species were members of the genus Chrysosporium. Some
   of these species were isolated but not identified and this part of the
   study was still to be completed. Another significant finding was the
   absence of fungi in one sample, while in another the widespread and
   abundant growth in all the seeded dishes of a single species of
   Chrysosporium. Other species in genera of general diffusion in many
   environments were also isolated: Aspergillus spp., Malbranchea sp.,
   Mycelia sterila spp., Paecilomyces sp., Penicillium spp. and
   Scopulariopsis spp.},

Title = {Evaluation of soil fungal communities using the ITS2 sublocus and 18S
   gene primers under different amplification methods},
Journal = {FUNGAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {76},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Primer selection and PCR methods can potentially lead to biased
   descriptions of microbial communities. Here, we investigated soil total
   fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community composition and
   diversity from diverse sites using several primers and amplification
   methods. The results showed that regardless of site, the
   ITS3tagmix1-5/ITS4ngs primer set generated a higher proportion of
   high-quality reads, targeted more fungal ASVs and revealed a higher
   total fungal alpha diversity compared to ITS3tagmix4/ITS4ngs. Among
   specific primers targeting the 18S rRNA gene, AMV4.5NF/AMDGR had
   differential specificity for Glomeraceae, whereas SSU515Fngs/Euk742R had
   differential specificity for Paraglomeraceae. Regardless of site, PCR
   approaches (nested vs non-nested) had higher influence on the AMF
   community structure than primer selection, though primer selection
   significantly influenced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi richness. Overall,
   the findings suggest that the specificity of amplification in relation
   to primer selection and PCR stringency should guide the best
   interpretation of fungal community diversity data from high-throughput
   sequencing of environmental samples.},

Abstract = {Samples of horizons in paleosols from the Quartermain Mountains of the
   Antarctic Dry Valleys (Aztec and New Mountain areas) were analyzed for
   their physical characteristics, mineralogy, chemical composition, and
   microbiology to determine the accumulation and movement of salts and
   other soluble constituents and the presence/absence of microbial
   populations. Salt concentrations are of special interest because they
   are considered to be a function of age, derived over time, in part from
   nearby oceanic and high-altitude atmospheric sources. The chemical
   composition of ancient Mioceneage paleosols in these areas is the direct
   result of the deposition and weathering of airborne-influxed salts and
   other materials, as well as the weathering of till derived principally
   from local dolerite and sandstone outcrops. Paleosols nearer the coast
   have greater contents of Cl, whereas near the inland ice sheet, nitrogen
   tends to increase on a relative basis. The accumulation and vertical
   distribution of salts and other soluble chemical elements indicate
   relative amounts of movement in the profile over long periods of time,
   in the order of several million years.
   Four of the six selected subsamples from paleosol horizons in two
   ancient soil profiles contained nil concentrations of bacteria and
   fungi. However, two horizons at depths of between 3 and 8 cm, in two
   profiles, yielded several colonies of the fungi Beauveria bassiana and
   Penicillium brevicompactum, indicating very minor input of organic
   carbon. Beauveria bassiana is often reported in association with insects
   and is used commercially for the biological control of some insect
   pests. Penicillium species are commonly isolated from Arctic, temperate,
   and tropical soils and are known to utilize a wide variety of organic
   carbon and nitrogen compounds. The cold, dry soils of the Antarctic bear
   a close resemblance to various present and past martian environments
   where similar weathering could occur and possible microbial populations
   may exist. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.},

Abstract = {Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) represents one of the two
   vascular plants that have colonized the Antarctic continent, which is
   usually exposed to extreme environmental conditions. In this work, we
   have characterized the endophytic fungi associated with the leaves of D.
   antarctica. Endophytic fungi were recovered from 91 individual plants
   from different points of Admiralty Bay at King George Island,
   Antarctica. A total of 26 fungal isolates were obtained from 273 leaf
   fragments. All isolates were identified by analysis of the sequences of
   the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the rDNA. Alternaria and
   Phaeosphaeria were the most frequent genera associated with the plant.
   Other fungal isolates were identified as Entrophospora sp. and several
   undescribed Ascomycete species. An interesting result was obtained for
   the isolates UFMGCB 215 and UFMGCB 262, which were related to fungi
   associated with bryophytes present in boreal ecosystems. Some isolates
   showed low identity in the ITS sequences to sequences of fungal species
   deposited in GenBank, suggesting that these fungi could be new species.
   This work is the first report on fungal endophytes associated with
   leaves of the Antarctic grass D. antarctica.},

Abstract = {Antarctica is a continent that presents extreme conditions for life.
   Numerous buildings that served as housing for expeditioners and
   scientists are considered historical heritage, including Casa Moneta
   Museum, located at the Orcadas Base on Laurie Island, South Orkney
   Islands (Antarctic Peninsula). It is built entirely of wood, and
   currently shows visible signs of deterioration. In this work, we studied
   the mycobiota present in the deteriorated wood of the museum to
   characterize the fungal diversity present. Macro-, micro-morphological
   and phylogenetic studies were carried out to identify the fungi
   isolated. Temperature tests were also performed to study the growth of
   different strains. Almost 20\% of the fungi isolated belonged to
   Cadophora. Other frequently obtained genera were Tulasnella (16\%),
   Cerinosterus (12\%), Coniochaeta (7\%), Geomyces (7\%), Acremonium (7\%)
   and Penicillium (7\%). Temperature tests indicated all strains isolated
   are psychrotolerant. Five species have been reported for the first time
   for Antarctica. Deterioration of historic wooden structures and
   artifacts in extreme environments is currently causing great concern,
   and in this study the identification of the fungi present in Casa
   Moneta's wood and the characterization of their metabolism could be a
   guide to the development of preservation strategies for this historical
   building.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Rhizopogon (Boletales) is an ectomycorrhizal fungal genus that exhibits
   a strong specificity to Pinaceae. This strict association occurs almost
   exclusively with Pinus and Pseudotsuga, while associations with other
   genera in Pinaceae are inconclusive. Here, we describe Rhizopogon
   laricinus sp. nov. associated with Larix cajanderi distributed in
   northeastern Siberia, where forest fires are frequent. We confirmed the
   host identity by comparing rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
   sequences obtained from basidiomata and ectomycorrhizal root tips
   collected at the same sites. Morphological characteristics and molecular
   identification revealed that R. laricinus is a new species associated
   with Larix unequivocally. The molecular phylogeny based on ITS sequences
   placed this species sister to the subgenus Roseoli, which is specific to
   Pinus, and not to the Pseudotsuga-specific subgenus Villosuli. Thus, R.
   laricinus evolution does not correspond to host phylogeny as Larix and
   Pseudotsuga form a monophyletic Glade. Instead, ecological traits of
   Rhizopogon for adapting to disturbed habitats may have driven the host
   shift to Larix under high-frequency fire ecosystems. (C) 2019 The

Title = {Mycosporine-like amino acids and phylogenies in green algae::

Abstract = {A UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acid (324 nm-MAA), so far only
   known from the green macroalgal genus Prasiola (Trebouxiophyceae), was
   also identified in other morphologically diverse green algae closely
   related to Prasiola spp. in 18S rDNA phylogenies. Using HPLC, a second
   UV-absorbing compound was found only in Myrmecia incisa Reisigal among
   all studied strains. This substance showed an absorption maximum at 322
   nm and hence was designated as putative 322 nm-MAA. Preliminary
   UV-exposure experiments indicated that all species containing one or the
   other MAA showed a strong accumulation of the respective compound, thus
   supporting their function as putative UV sunscreen. Both UV-absorbing
   substances were only identified in the studied members of the
   Trebouxiophyceae but were absent in members of the Ulvophyceae and
   Chlorophyceae. When mapped on an 18S rDNA phylogeny, the distribution of
   324 nm-MAA was found to be scattered within the Trebouxiophyceae but was
   consistent with a distribution that follows phylogenetic patterns rather
   than ecological adaptations. The 324 nm-MAA was also detected in two
   phylogenetically related species from freshwater as well as from
   subaerial habitats, Watanabea reniformis Hanagata et al. and isolate
   UR7/5, which were phylogenetically independent of Prasiola and its
   closer allies. MAAs were absent in another Trebouxiophyceae clade
   comprising lichen photobionts (Coccomyxa pringsheimii Jaag) as well as
   freshwater picoplanktonic algae (Choricystis minor (Skuja) Fott). The
   data presented suggest a chemotaxonomic value of the 324 nm-MAA in green
   algal taxonomy. To address the paraphyly of the genus Myrmecia Printz as
   presently circumscribed, we propose the new combination Lobosphaera
   incisa.},

Title = {Native and Alien Antarctic Grasses as a Habitat for Fungi},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Biological invasions are now seen as one of the main threats to the
   Antarctic ecosystem. An example of such an invasion is the recent
   colonization of the H. Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station area by the
   non-native grass Poa annua. This site was previously occupied only by
   native plants like the Antarctic hair grass Deschampsia antarctica. To
   adapt successfully to new conditions, plants interact with soil
   microorganisms, including fungi. The aim of this study was to determine
   how the newly introduced grass P. annua established an interaction with
   fungi compared to resident grass D. antarctica. We found that fungal
   diversity in D. antarctica roots was significantly higher compared with
   P. annua roots. D. antarctica managed a biodiverse microbiome because of
   its ability to recruit fungal biocontrol agents from the soil, thus
   maintaining a beneficial nature of the endophyte community. P. annua
   relied on a set of specific fungal taxa, which likely modulated its cold
   response, increasing its competitiveness in Antarctic conditions.
   Cultivated endophytic fungi displayed strong chitinolysis, pointing
   towards their role as phytopathogenic fungi, nematode, and insect
   antagonists. This is the first study to compare the root mycobiomes of
   both grass species by direct culture-independent techniques as well as
   culture-based methods.},

Abstract = {Antarctica includes different pristine environments dominated by

   importance of Antarctic microorganisms, some of them can represent
   interesting sources of bioproducts with potential industrial
   application. In the present study, we analysed the agarolytic and
   carrageenolytic activities of algicolous fungi from seven different
   macroalgal species of maritime Antarctica. After a selective isolation
   process, 44 fungal isolates were recovered and identified by biology
   molecular methods as belonging to the genera Antarctomyces, Beauveria,
   Cladosporium, Coprinellus, Doratomyces, Leucosporidiella, Metschnikowia,
   Penicillium, and Pseudogymnoascus. Rhodophyta macroalgae sheltered the
   fungi with the best potential for agarolytic and carrageenolytic
   activities. Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium sp., and Cladosporium
   sp. 2 simultaneously displayed the best carrageenolytic and agarolytic
   activities. Our results indicated that the Antarctic macroalgae shelter
   saprobe fungi that produce enzymes with the potential to degrade algal
   biomass and might release essential nutrients into the Antarctic Ocean.
   These agarolytic and/or carrageenolytic Antarctic fungi may also be
   useful in further industrial processes involving the biological
   extraction of agar and carrageenan, or their byproducts, to be used as
   substrates of third-generation bioethanol.},

Abstract = {Spore-forming bacteria are known to produce various enzymes and
   bioproducts valuable to different industries and to bear the harsh
   conditions found in the Antarctic environment. However, aerobic or
   facultative spore-forming bacterial communities found in maritime
   Antarctic soils yet remain poorly studied. In this study, 80
   spore-forming and cold-adapted bacterial strains were isolated from nine
   different soil samples of King George Island, in maritime Antarctica,
   and further clustered into amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis
   groups within each soil. Representative strains were then identified as
   belonging to Bacillus, Rummeliibacillus, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina
   by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The ability to produce extracellular
   enzymes, antimicrobial substances and biosurfactants was determined in
   all isolates. The enzymatic activities most frequently found among the
   isolates were as follows: esterase (45 \%), caseinase (30 \%), amylase
   (16.2 \%) and gelatinase (15 \%). Biosurfactant production was detected
   in 25 \% of the isolates. The growth inhibition of methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus was observed in 13.7 \% of the strains tested, but
   only two strains inhibited the growth of Candida albicans. The isolated
   spore-forming bacterial species were also compared with the
   characteristics of the different Antarctic soils sampled based on their
   physicochemical properties, showing that pH, C and P were the main
   factors correlated with the distribution of this group of bacteria in
   the Antarctic soils studied. These Antarctic endospore-forming bacterial
   strains may have a potential for industrial processes occurring at low
   temperatures.},

Abstract = {Recently, the study of the interactions within a microcosm between hosts
   and their associated microbial communities drew an unprecedented
   interest arising from the holobiont concept. Lichens, a symbiotic
   association between a fungus and an alga, are redefined as complex
   ecosystems considering the tremendous array of associated microorganisms
   that satisfy this concept. The present study focuses on the diversity of
   the microbiota associated with the seashore located lichen Rhizocarpon
   geographicum, recovered by different culture-dependent methods. Samples
   harvested from two sites allowed the isolation and the molecular
   identification of 68 fungal isolates distributed in 43 phylogenetic
   groups, 15 bacterial isolates distributed in five taxonomic groups and
   three microalgae belonging to two species. Moreover, for 12 fungal
   isolates belonging to 10 different taxa, the genus was not described in
   GenBank. These fungal species have never been sequenced or described and
   therefore non-studied. All these findings highlight the novel and high
   diversity of the microflora associated with R. geographicum. While many
   species disappear every day, this work suggests that coastal and wild
   environments still contain an unrevealed variety to offer and that
   lichens constitute a great reservoir of new microbial taxa which can be
   recovered by multiplying the culture-dependent techniques.},

Abstract = {This work describes the distribution and diversity of fungal endophytes
   associated with leaves of Colobanthus quitensis, a dicotyledonous plant
   that lives in Antarctica. A total of 188 fungal isolates were obtained
   from six different sites located across a 25.5-km transect through
   Admiralty Bay, at King George Island. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear
   ribosomal gene was sequenced and the endophytic fungi were identified as
   species belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Cadophora, Davidiella,
   Entrophospora, Fusarium, Geomyces, Gyoerffyella, Microdochium,
   Mycocentrospora, and Phaeosphaeria. Davidiella tassiana was the
   prevalent species with 20.2\% abundance. The endophytic fungal community
   showed low richness and high dominance indexes. Eleven endophytic taxa
   (58\%) were fungi able to produce melanin in their hyphae, which may
   confer resistance against freezing temperatures and high rates of UV
   radiation and may increase their fitness in the extreme conditions of
   the Antarctic environment. In addition, phytopathogenic and decomposer
   species associated with healthy leaves of C. quitensis were found. The
   results obtained in this work show that C. quitensis is an interesting
   reservoir of saprobic and pathogenic fungal species, and could be a
   community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies, as well
   as studies of the adaptation mechanisms these microorganisms have to the
   extreme conditions in Antarctica.},

Title = {Influence of soil N availability on the difference between tree foliage
   and soil δ<SUP>15</SUP>N from comparison of Mongolia and northern Japan},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {101},

Abstract = {Nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15) in plants and soil are widely known
   as indicators of the N cycle in terrestrial ecosystem. Recent studies
   have proposed that the difference between plant and soil delta N-15
   (Delta delta N-15) is a better indicator of the N cycle than plant delta
   N-15 or soil delta N-15 alone. However, the processes of the N cycle
   indicated by Delta delta N-15 are not well understood. The present study
   compared Delta delta N-15 variations between different ecosystems of
   northern Mongolia and northern Japan (Hokkaido) to associate the Delta
   delta N-15 characteristics with soil N availability. Needles of Siberian
   larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) in Mongolia, Todo-fir (Abies sachalinensis
   (F. Schmidt) Mast.) in Hokkaido, and mineral soils from both regions
   were acquired for determination of Delta delta N-15 values. Delta delta
   N-15 showed similar large variations (8\%) in the two regions with no
   significant correlations to climate factors. On the other hand, the
   relationship between Delta delta N-15 and soil delta N-15 was opposite
   between the two regions with a positive correlation in Mongolia (r(s) =
   0.504) and a negative correlation in Hokkaido (r(s) = -0.600). Moreover,
   total inorganic N (total amount of NH4+ and NO3-) contents were up to 20
   times higher in Hokkaido than in Mongolia. Delta delta N-15 showed
   significant correlation with the fraction of NO3- relative to total
   inorganic N in the 0-10 cm soil layer in Hokkaido. These results
   indicate that Delta delta N-15 variation in Hokkaido can be explained by
   progression of nitrification in soil, which is different in Mongolia
   where Delta delta N-15 variation is explained by microbial N
   immobilization. Our findings suggest that soil N availability affects
   Delta delta N-15 indicator owing to changes in the N cycle process,
   which are reflected in the relationships of foliage delta N-15 or soil
   delta N-15 with Delta delta N-15.},

Abstract = {The terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica is restricted to small, very
   isolated, ice-free areas on the continent and on the islands adjacent to
   the Peninsula region. Lichens, a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga
   or cyanobacterium, form the most prominent component in the vegetation.
   They have the greatest number of species compared with other cryptogamic
   and unicellular organisms. They are able to colonize all types of solid
   substrata and have a low mineral nutrient demand. Their physiological
   vigour is derived from high freezing tolerance and the ability to be
   photosynthetically activated by water vapour uptake from snow at
   temperatures as low as c. -20 degrees C. Long-term monitoring in their
   natural habitats demonstrates that lichens are photosynthetically active
   at suboptimal temperatures. Locally, however, they can benefit from
   meltwater on insolated rocks, but only for short periods in early
   summer. Although at this time they may be exposed to substrate
   temperatures of > 20 degrees C and strong light they do not suffer from
   photostress. If, in winter, lichens are covered and kept dark by snow
   with temperatures close to 0 degrees C, lichens enter a negative carbon
   balance. This effect may be relevant to lichens under conditions of
   global or regional warming.},

Title = {Mycelium-bound lipases of fungi as biocatalysts for biodiesel synthesis
   - A proposal to use FTIR as a rapid screening method},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {204},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this study, biocatalysts in the form of mycelium-bound lipases of
   psychrotrophic and mesophilic fungi were screened for their ability to
   synthesize fatty acid methyl (FAME) and ethyl esters (FAEE). It has been
   shown that the hydrolytic activity of biocatalysts is not accompanied by
   their biodiesel synthetic activity. Preliminary studies showed for the
   first time, that the FTIR technique can be used to predict synthetic
   activity. The highest correlation between the intensity of the bands and
   synthetic activity, negative and positive, respectively, was observed
   for two neighboring bands at 1745 cm(-1) (R = -0.73) and 1699 cm(-1) (R
   = 0.68). The psychrotrophic strain Penicillium sp. 59, isolated from the
   soil of the Arctic tundra (Spitsbergen), has been shown for the first
   time as an efficient whole-cell biocatalyst for fatty acid ethyl ester
   synthesis and is stable in organic solvents. Mathematical optimization
   of biosynthesis was also performed using RSM. A molar canola oil
   conversion value of 83.3\% into FAEE was obtained at 24.2 degrees C in
   n-hexane using 7.6\% of used canola oil and 5.3\% of the fungal
   biocatalyst within 6 h. Dry mycelium of Penicillium sp. 59 is a
   promising new biocatalyst for large-scale biosynthesis of biodiesel,
   given its low-cost production, high activity at room temperature, no
   need to mix reactions, and reusability in a minimum of six cycles.},

   27 filamentous fungi and 48 yeasts, were isolated from the three algal
   species and identified by morphological, physiological, and sequence
   analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region and D1/D2 variable
   domains of the large-subunit rRNA gene. The filamentous fungi and yeasts
   obtained were identified as belonging to the genera Geomyces,
   Antarctomyces, Oidiodendron, Penicillium, Phaeosphaeria, Aureobasidium,
   Cryptococcus, Leucosporidium, Metschnikowia, and Rhodotorula. The
   prevalent species were the filamentous fungus Geomyces pannorum and the
   yeast Metschnikowia australis. Two fungal species isolated in our study,
   Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and M. australis, are endemic to
   Antarctica. This work is the first study of fungi associated with
   Antarctic marine macroalgae, and contributes to the taxonomy and ecology
   of the marine fungi living in polar environments. These fungal species
   may have an important role in the ecosystem and in organic matter

Title = {Discrete taxa of saprotrophic fungi respire different ages of carbon
   from Antarctic soils},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Different organic compounds have distinct residence times in soil and
   are degraded by specific taxa of saprotrophic fungi. It hence follows
   that specific fungal taxa should respire carbon of different ages from
   these compounds to the atmosphere. Here, we test whether this is the
   case by radiocarbon (C-14) dating CO2 evolved from two gamma
   radiation-sterilised maritime Antarctic soils inoculated with pure
   single cultures of four fungi. We show that a member of the Helotiales,
   which accounted for 41-56\% of all fungal sequences in the two soils,
   respired soil carbon that was aged up to 1,200 years BP and which was
   350-400 years older than that respired by the other three taxa. Analyses
   of the enzyme profile of the Helotialean fungus and the fluxes and delta
   C-13 values of CO2 that it evolved suggested that its release of old
   carbon from soil was associated with efficient cellulose decomposition.
   Our findings support suggestions that increases in the ages of carbon
   respired from warmed soils may be caused by changes to the abundances or
   activities of discrete taxa of microbes, and indicate that the loss of
   old carbon from soils is driven by specific fungal taxa.},

Title = {Internal transcribed spacer primers and sequences for improved
   characterization of basidiomycetous orchid mycorrhizas},
Journal = {NEW PHYTOLOGIST},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {177},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1020-1033},
Abstract = {Despite advances owing to molecular approaches, several hurdles still
   obstruct the identification of fungi forming orchid mycorrhizas. The
   Tulasnellaceae exhibit accelerated evolution of the nuclear ribosomal
   operon, causing most standard primers to fail in polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) trials. Insufficient sequences are available from well
   characterized isolates and fruitbodies. Lastly, taxon-specific PCR
   primers are needed in order to explore the ecology of the fungi outside
   of the orchid root. Here, progress in overcoming these hurdles is
   reported.
   Broad-spectrum basidiomycete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers
   that do not exclude most known Tulasnellaceae are presented. BLAST
   searches and empirical PCR tests support their wide utility within the
   Basidiomycota.
   Taxon-specific ITS primers are presented targeted to orchid-associated
   Tulasnella, and a core component of the Thelephora-Tomentella complex.
   The efficiency and selectivity of these primer sets are again supported
   by BLAST searches and empirical tests.
   Lastly, ITS DNA sequences are presented from several strains of
   Epulorhiza, Ceratorhiza, Ceratobasidium, Sistotrema, Thanatephorus and
   Tulasnella that were originally described in the landmark mycorrhizal
   studies of Currah and Warcup. Detailed phylogenetic analyses reveal some
   inconsistencies in species concepts in these taxonomically challenging
   resupinate basidiomycetes, but also help to place several sequences from
   environmental samples.},

   habitats},
Journal = {NATURE MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Pages = {925-932},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Dispersal is a critical yet poorly understood factor underlying
   macroecological patterns in microbial communities(1). Airborne microbial
   transport is assumed to occupy a central role in determining dispersal
   outcomes(2,3), and extra-range dispersal has important implications for
   predicting ecosystem resilience and response to environmental changes.
   One of the most pertinent biomes in this regard is Antarctica, given its
   geographic isolation and vulnerability to climate change and human
   disturbances. Here, we report microbial diversity in near-ground and
   high-altitude air above the largest ice-free Antarctic habitat, as well
   as that of underlying soil microbial communities. We found that
   persistent local airborne inputs were unable to fully explain Antarctic
   soil community assembly. Comparison with airborne microbial diversity
   from high-altitude and non-polar sources suggests that strong selection
   occurs during long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of
   selection during airborne transit and at sink locations varied between
   microbial phyla. Overall, the communities from this isolated Antarctic
   ecosystem displayed limited connectivity to the non-polar microbial
   pool, and alternative sources of recruitment are necessary to fully
   explain extant soil diversity. Our findings provide critical insights
   into the role of airborne transport limitation in determining microbial
   biogeographic patterns.},

Abstract = {Fungal biotransformation is an attractive synthetic strategy to produce
   highly specific compounds with chemical functionality in regions of the
   carbon skeleton that are not easily activated by conventional organic
   chemistry methods. In this work, Cladosporium antarcticum isolated from
   sediments of Glacier Collins in Antarctica was used to obtain novel
   drimane sesquiterpenoids alcohols with activity against Candida yeast
   from drimendiol and epidrimendiol. These compounds were produced by the
   high-yield reduction of polygodial and isotadeonal with NaBH4 in
   methanol. Cladosporium antarcticum produced two major products from
   drimendiol, identified as 9 alpha-hydroxydrimendiol (1, 41.4 mg, 19.4\%
   yield) and 3 beta-hydroxydrimendiol (2, 74.8 mg, 35\% yield), whereas
   the biotransformation of epidrimendiol yielded only one product, 9
   beta-hydroxyepidrimendiol (3, 86.6 mg, 41.6\% yield). The products were
   purified by column chromatography and their structure elucidated by NMR
   and MS. The antifungal activity of compounds 1-3 was analyzed against
   Candida albicans, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, showing that compound 2
   has a MIC lower than 15 mu g/mL against the three-pathogenic yeast. In
   silico studies suggest that a possible mechanism of action for the novel
   compounds is the inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol 14
   alpha-demethylase, affecting the ergosterol synthesis.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {459-477},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We review the lithic microbial ecosystems of the McMurdo Dry Valleys as
   the main form of terrestrial colonization in this region, and assess the
   role of environmental controls such as temperature, solar radiation,
   water availability, wind, nutrient availability, salinity and the
   physicochemical properties of the colonized rock. Epilithic communities,
   especially those dominated by lichens, are able to withstand extreme
   environmental conditions but subsurface endolithic microhabitats provide
   more tolerant conditions. Endolithic microbial communities can be
   grouped into two main classes: eukaryotic communities (dominated by
   lichenized fungi and algae) and prokaryotic communities (dominated by
   cyanobacteria). Heterotrophic bacteria and non-lichenized algae and
   fungi (mainly black fungi) are also components of these communities.
   These lithobiontic microorganisms generally have effective mechanisms
   against freezing temperatures and desiccation. Extracellular polymeric
   substances play an important role not only in protecting microbial cells
   but also in community organization and in mitigating microenvironmental
   conditions. Antarctic lithobiontic communities are comprised of
   microbial consortia within which multiple interactions between the
   different biological and abiotic components are essential for microbial
   survival, whilst fossils and biomarkers provide evidence of earlier
   successful microbial life in Antarctic deserts. Finally, the uniqueness
   of the present lithobiont assemblages suggests they are the outcome of
   geographical isolation during the evolution of the continent and not
   merely the descendants of a subset of globally distributed taxa that
   have adapted to the extreme environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {The yeast Pseudozyma antarctica secretes a concentrated biodegradable
   plastic (BP)-degrading enzyme when cultivated with xylose. Treatment
   with the culture filtrate reduced the puncture strength of commercial BP
   mulch films. After burying the film in soil, the residual amount of
   solid film was reduced significantly, and none was recovered after 5
   weeks. The dynamics of soil fungal communities were analyzed weekly
   after burying the film using 18S rDNA polymerase chain
   reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) profiling of
   soil DNA. In the soil containing enzyme-treated film, the native
   community essentially recovered within 24 weeks. In comparison, the
   untreated solid film remained in the soil for 12 weeks and the response
   of the soil-fungal community was relatively slow; it had not recovered
   within 24 weeks. (C) 2018, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All

Abstract = {Reduced to near extinction in the late 1800s, a number of wood bison
   populations (Bison bison athabascae) have been re-established through
   reintroduction initiatives. Although an invaluable tool for
   conservation, translocation of animals can spread infectious agents to
   new areas or expose animals to pathogens in their new environment.
   Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, a bacterium that causes
   chronic enteritis in ruminants, is among the pathogens of potential
   concern for wood bison management and conservation. In order to inform
   translocation decisions, our objectives were to determine the M. avium
   subsp. paratuberculosis infection status of wood bison herds in Canada
   and to culture and genetically characterize the infective strain(s). We
   tested fecal samples from bison (n = 267) in nine herds using direct PCR
   for three M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific genetic targets with
   different copy numbers within the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis
   genome. Restriction enzyme analysis (REA) and sequencing of IS1311 were
   performed on seven samples from five different herds. We also evaluated
   a panel of different culture conditions for their ability to support M.
   avium subsp. paratuberculosis growth from feces and tissues of
   direct-PCR-positive animals. Eighty-one fecal samples (30\%) tested
   positive using direct IS900 PCR, with positive samples from all nine
   herds; of these, 75\% and 21\% were also positive using ISMAP02 and F57,
   respectively. None of the culture conditions supported the growth of M.
   avium subsp. paratuberculosis from PCR-positive samples. IS1311 REA and
   sequencing indicate that at least two different M. avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis strain types exist in Canadian wood bison. The presence
   of different M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains among wood bison
   herds should be considered in the planning of translocations.},

Title = {A Phylogenetic and Functional Perspective on Volatile Organic Compound
   Production by Actinobacteria},
Journal = {MSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Soil microbes produce an immense diversity of metabolites, including
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can shape the structure and
   function of microbial communities. VOCs mediate a multitude of
   microbe-microbe interactions, including antagonism. Despite their
   importance, the diversity and functional relevance of most microbial
   volatiles remain uncharacterized. We assembled a taxonomically diverse
   collection of 48 Actinobacteria isolated from soil and airborne dust and
   surveyed the VOCs produced by these strains on two different medium
   types in vitro using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We
   detected 126 distinct VOCs and structurally identified approximately
   20\% of these compounds, which were predominately C-1 to C-5
   hetero-VOCs, including (oxygenated) alcohols, ketones, esters, and
   nitrogen-and sulfur-containing compounds. Each strain produced a unique
   VOC profile. While the most common VOCs were likely by-products of
   primary metabolism, most of the VOCs were strain specific. We observed a
   strong taxonomic and phylogenetic signal for VOC profiles, suggesting
   their role in finer-scale patterns of ecological diversity. Finally, we
   investigated the functional potential of these VOCs by assessing their
   effects on growth rates of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic
   pseudomonad strains. We identified sets of VOCs that correlated with
   growth inhibition and stimulation, information that may facilitate the
   development of microbial VOC-based pathogen control strategies.
   IMPORTANCE Soil microbes produce a diverse array of natural products,
   including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Volatile compounds are
   important molecules in soil habitats, where they mediate interactions
   between bacteria, fungi, insects, plants, and animals. We measured the
   VOCs produced by a broad diversity of soil- and dust-dwelling
   Actinobacteria in vitro. We detected a total of 126 unique volatile
   compounds, and each strain produced a unique combination of VOCs. While
   some of the compounds were produced by many strains, most were strain
   specific. Importantly, VOC profiles were more similar between closely
   related strains, indicating that evolutionary and ecological processes
   generate predictable patterns of VOC production. Finally, we observed
   that actinobacterial VOCs had both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on
   the growth of bacteria that represent a plant-beneficial symbiont and a
   plant-pathogenic strain, information that may lead to the development of
   novel strategies for plant disease prevention.},

Title = {Characterization of amylase produced by cold-adapted bacteria from
   Antarctic samples},
Journal = {BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Antarctic continent is characterized by extreme conditions and
   encompasses peculiar environments which represent promising habitats for
   the recovery of well-adapted microorganisms with unique metabolic
   capabilities. Enzymatic activity combined to salinity and pH tolerance
   of bacteria that thrive in low temperature environment have attracted
   attention of researchers in recent years and, as scarce information on
   that topic is available, the aim of this study was to prospect bacteria
   isolated from Antarctic samples for extracellular amylase activity and
   to determine their salinity and pH tolerances. Ninety-one bacteria
   isolated from Antarctic environmental samples, including marine sponges
   and invertebrates, sediments and soil biofilm, were screened. Fourty-two
   isolates were selected as putative amylase producers based on their
   ability to produce clearing zones in agar plates. Eighty-six and
   forty-four isolates were able to grow at 5 and 10\% NaCl concentrations,
   respectively. The best enzymatic activities for isolates 226 and 227
   were 768.5 U dL 1 (20 degrees C) and 1410,16 U dL 1 (20 degrees C),
   respectively, both influenced by the temperature. All variables assayed
   showed statistically significant differences for isolates 227 and 226,
   demonstrating that enzyme activities respond differently to the applied
   conditions. This is the first report that describes the amylase activity
   from Carnobacterium and Psychrobacter strains isolated from Antarctic
   samples. These results encourage subsequent investigations of enzymes
   produced by microorganisms adapted to low temperatures and high
   osmolarity conditions, aiming future biotechnological application in
   pharmaceutical, textile or food industries.},

Abstract = {Global warming will have far-reaching effects on our ecosystem. However,
   its effects on Antarctic soils have been poorly explored. To assess the
   effects of warming on microbial abundance and community composition, we
   sampled Antarctic soils from the King George Island in the Antarctic
   Peninsula and incubated these soils at elevated temperatures of 5
   degrees C and 8 degrees C for 14 days. The reduction in total organic
   carbon and increase in soil respiration were attributed to the increased
   proliferation of Bacteria, Fungi, and Archaea. Interestingly, bacterial
   ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes were predominant over archaeal amoA,
   unlike in many other environments reported previously. Phylogenetic
   analyses of bacterial and archaeal amoA communities via clone libraries
   revealed that the diversity of amoA genes in Antarctic ammonia-oxidizing
   prokaryotic communities were temperature-insensitive. Interestingly, our
   data also showed that the amoA of Antarctic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria
   (AOB) communities differed from previously described amoA sequences of
   cultured isolates and clone library sequences, suggesting the presence
   of novel Antarctic-specific AOB communities. Denitrification-related
   genes were significantly reduced under warming conditions, whereas the
   abundance of amoA and nifH increased. Barcoded pyrosequencing of the
   bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and
   Actinobacteria were the major phyla in Antarctic soils and the effect of
   short-term warming on the bacterial community was not apparent.},

Abstract = {The Antarctic black meristematic fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515
   occurs endolithically in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, one of
   the best analogue for Mars environment on Earth. To date, this fungus is
   considered one of the best eukaryotic models for astrobiological studies
   and has been repeatedly selected for space experiments in the last
   decade. The obtained results are reviewed here, with special focus on
   responses to space relevant irradiation, UV radiation, and both sparsely
   and densely ionizing radiation, which represent the major injuries for a
   putative space-traveller. The remarkable resistance of this model
   organism to space stress, its radioresistance in particular, and
   mechanisms involved, significantly contributed to expanding our concept
   of limits for life and provided new insights on the origin and evolution
   of life in planetary systems, habitability, and biosignatures for life

Abstract = {Fermentation of the marine-derived fungus Trichoderma asperellum,
   collected from the sediment of the Antarctic Penguin Island, resulted in
   the isolation of six new peptaibols named asperelines A-F (1-6), which
   are characterized by an acetylated N-terminus and a C-terminus
   containing an uncommon prolinol residue. Structures were determined by
   extensive 1D and 2D NMR (H-1-H-1 COSY, HMQC, HMBC, NOESY) spectroscopic
   data analysis combined with ESIMS/MS fragmentation. The absolute
   configurations of the amino acid residues possessing a chiral
   alpha-carbon and of the prolinol residue were determined to be L and S,
   respectively, using a new method of H-1 NMR spectroscopic comparison of
   complexes formed between the chiral reagent Ru(D-4-Por{*})CO and amino
   acids derived from the peptaibols with those formed with reference
   standards.},

Title = {Microbial Diversity of Browning Pennisula, Eastern Antarctica Revealed
   Using Molecular and Cultivation Methods},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Browning Peninsula is an ice-free polar desert situated in the Windmill
   Islands, Eastern Antarctica. The entire site is described as a barren
   landscape, comprised of frost boils with soils dominated by microbial
   life. In this study, we explored the microbial diversity and edaphic
   drivers of community structure across this site using traditional
   cultivation methods, a novel approach the soil substrate membrane system
   (SSMS), and culture-independent 454-tag pyrosequencing. The measured
   soil environmental and microphysical factors of chlorine, phosphate,
   aspect and elevation were found to be significant drivers of the
   bacterial community, while none of the soil parameters analyzed were
   significantly correlated to the fungal community. Overall, Browning
   Peninsula soil harbored a distinctive microbial community in comparison
   to other Antarctic soils comprised of a unique bacterial diversity and
   extremely limited fungal diversity. Tag pyrosequencing data revealed the
   bacterial community to be dominated by Actinobacteria (36\%), followed
   by Chloroflexi (18\%), Cyanobacteria (14\%), and Proteobacteria (10\%).
   For fungi, Ascomycota (97\%) dominated the soil microbiome, followed by
   Basidiomycota. As expected the diversity recovered from culture-based
   techniques was lower than that detected using tag sequencing. However,
   in the SSMS enrichments, that mimic the natural conditions for
   cultivating oligophilic ``k-selected{''} bacteria, a larger proportion
   of rare bacterial taxa (15\%), such as Blastococcus, Devosia,
   Herbaspirillum, Propionibacterium and Methylocella and fungal (11\%)
   taxa, such as Nigrospora, Exophiala, Hortaea, and Penidiella were
   recovered at the genus level. At phylum level, a comparison of OTU's
   showed that the SSMS shared 21\% of Acidobacteria, 11\% of
   Actinobacteria and 10\% of Proteobacteria OTU's with soil. For fungi,
   the shared OTUs was 4\% ( Basidiomycota) and <0.5\%( Ascomycota). This
   was the first known attempt to culture microfungi using the SSMS which
   resulted in an increase in diversity from 14 to 57 microfungi OTUs
   compared to standard cultivation. Furthermore, the SSMS offers the
   opportunity to retrieve a greater diversity of bacterial and fungal taxa
   for future exploitation.},

Abstract = {Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities are self-supporting borderline
   ecosystems spreading across the extreme conditions of the Antarctic
   desert and represent the predominant life-form in the ice-free areas of
   McMurdo Dry Valleys, accounted as the closest terrestrial Martian
   analogue. Components of these communities are highly adapted
   extremophiles and extreme-tolerant microorganisms, among the most
   resistant known to date. Recently, studies investigated biodiversity and
   community composition in these ecosystems but the metabolic activity of
   the metacommunity has never been investigated. Using an untargeted
   metabolomics, we explored stress-response of communities spreading in
   two sites of the same location, subjected to increasing environmental
   pressure due to opposite sun exposure, accounted as main factor
   influencing the diversity and composition of these ecosystems. Overall,
   331 altered metabolites (206 and 125 unique for north and south,
   respectively), distinguished the two differently exposed communities. We
   also selected 10 metabolites and performed two-stage Receiver Operating
   Characteristic (ROC) analysis to test them as potential biomarkers. We
   further focused on melanin and allantoin as protective substances; their
   concentration was highly different in the community in the shadow or in
   the sun. These results clearly indicate that opposite insolation
   selected organisms in the communities with different adaptation
   strategies in terms of key metabolites produced.},

Title = {Melanin is effective in protecting fast and slow growing fungi from

Abstract = {Melanin is a ubiquitous pigment with unique physicochemical properties.
   The resistance of melanized fungi to cosmic and terrestrial ionizing
   radiation suggests that melanin also plays a pivotal role in
   radioprotection. In this study, we compared the effects of
   densely-ionizing deuterons and sparsely-ionizing X-rays on two
   microscopic fungi capable of melanogenesis. We utilized the fast-growing
   pathogenic basiodiomycete forming an induced DOPA-melanin, Cryptococcus
   neoformans (CN); and the slow-growing environmental rock-inhabiting
   ascomycete synthesizing a constitutive DHN-melanin, Cryomyces
   antarcticus (CA); melanized and non-melanized counterparts were
   compared. CA was more resistant to deuterons than CN, and similar
   resistance was observed for X-rays. Melanin afforded protection against
   high-dose (1.5 kGy) deuterons for both CN and CA (p-values<10(-4)). For
   X-rays (0.3 kGy), melanin protected CA (p-values<10(-4)) and probably
   CN. Deuterons increased XTT activity in melanized strains of both
   species, while the activity in non-melanized cells remained stable or
   decreased. For ATP levels the reverse occurred: it decreased in
   melanized strains, but not in non-melanized ones, after deuteron
   exposure. For both XTT and ATP, which reflect the metabolic activity of
   the cells, larger and more statistically-significant differences as a
   function of melanization status occurred in CN. Our data show, for the
   first time, that melanin protected both fast-growing and slow-growing
   fungi from high doses of deuterons under physiological conditions. These
   observations may give clues for creating melanin-based radioprotectors.},

Title = {Antarctic fungi with antibiotic potential isolated from Fort William
   Point, Antarctica},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {The Antarctic continent is one of the most inhospitable places on earth,
   where living creatures, mostly represented by microorganisms, have
   specific physiological characteristics that allow them to adapt to the
   extreme environmental conditions. These physiological adaptations can
   result in the production of unique secondary metabolites with potential
   biotechnological applications. The current study presents a genetic and
   antibacterial characterization of four Antarctic fungi isolated from
   soil samples collected in Pedro Vicente Maldonado Scientific Station, at
   Fort William Point, Greenwich Island, Antarctica. Based on the sequences
   of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the fungi were
   identified as Antarctomyces sp., Thelebolus sp., Penicillium sp., and
   Cryptococcus gilvescens. The antibacterial activity was assessed against
   four clinical bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
   pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, by a
   modified bacterial growth inhibition assay on agar plates. Results
   showed that C. gilvescens and Penicillium sp. have potential antibiotic
   activity against all bacterial strains. Interestingly, Thelebolus sp.
   showed potential antibiotic activity only against E. coli. In contrast,
   Antarctomyces sp. did not show antibiotic activity against any of the
   bacteria tested under our experimental conditions. This study highlights
   the importance of conservation of Antarctica as a source of metabolites
   with important biomedical applications.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Antarctica is one of the most stressful environments for plant life and
   the Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) is adapted to the
   hostile conditions. Plant-associated microorganisms can contribute to
   plant survival in cold environments, but scarce information is available
   on the taxonomic structure and functional roles of C.
   quitensis-associated microbial communities. This study aimed at
   evaluating the possible impacts of climate warming on the taxonomic
   structure of C. quitensis endophytes and at investigating the
   contribution of culturable bacterial endophytes to plant growth at low
   temperatures. The culture-independent analysis revealed changes in the
   taxonomic structure of bacterial and fungal communities according to
   plant growth conditions, such as the collection site and the presence of
   open-top chambers (OTCs), which can simulate global warming. Plants
   grown inside OTCs showed lower microbial richness and higher relative
   abundances of biomarker bacterial genera
   (Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Aeromicrobium,
   Aureimonas, Hymenobacter, Novosphingobium, Pedobacter, Pseudomonas and
   Sphingomonas) and fungal genera (Alternaria, Cistella, and
   Vishniacozyma) compared to plants collected from open areas (OA), as a
   possible response to global warming simulated by OTCs. Culturable
   psychrotolerant bacteria of C. quitensis were able to endophytically
   colonize tomato seedlings and promote shoot growth at low temperatures,
   suggesting their potential contribution to plant tolerance to cold

Abstract = {Our understanding of the diversity and community dynamics of soil fungi
   has increased greatly through the use of DNA-based identification.
   Community characterization of metabolically active communities via RNA
   sequencing has previously revealed differences between `active' and
   `total' fungal communities, which may be influenced by the persistence
   of DNA from nonactive components. However, it is not known how fungal
   traits influence their prevalence in these contrasting community
   profiles. In this study, we coextracted DNA and RNA from soil collected
   from three Antarctic islands to test for differences between total and
   active soil fungal communities. By matching these geographically
   isolated fungi against a global dataset of soil fungi, we show that
   widely dispersed taxa are often more abundant in the total community,
   whilst taxa restricted to Antarctica are more likely to have higher
   abundance in the active community. In addition, we find that active
   communities have lower richness, and show a reduction in the abundance
   of the most dominant fungi, whilst there are consistent differences in
   the abundances of certain taxonomic groups between the total and active
   communities. These results suggest that the views of soil fungal
   communities offered by DNA- and RNA-based characterization differ in
   predictable ways.},

Title = {Microbes Producing L-Asparaginase free of Glutaminase and Urease
   isolated from Extreme Locations of Antarctic Soil and Moss},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {L-Asparaginase (L-asparagine aminohydrolase, E. C. 3.5.1.1) has been
   proven to be competent in treating Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL),
   which is widely observed in paediatric and adult groups. Currently,
   clinical L-Asparaginase formulations are derived from bacterial sources
   such as Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. These formulations
   when administered to ALL patients lead to several immunological and
   hypersensitive reactions. Hence, additional purification steps are
   required to remove toxicity induced by the amalgamation of other enzymes
   like glutaminase and urease. Production of L-Asparaginase that is free
   of glutaminase and urease is a major area of research. In this paper, we
   report the screening and isolation of fungal species collected from the
   soil and mosses in the Schirmacher Hills, Dronning Maud Land,
   Antarctica, that produce L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease.
   A total of 55 isolates were obtained from 33 environmental samples that
   were tested by conventional plate techniques using Phenol red and
   Bromothymol blue as indicators. Among the isolated fungi, 30 isolates
   showed L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. The L-Asparaginase
   producing strain Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1, which showed the highest
   zone index, was then optimized with a Taguchi design. Optimum enzyme
   activity of 20.57 U mL(-1) was obtained at a temperature of 30 degrees C
   and pH of 7.0 after 60 hours. Our work suggests that isolation of fungi
   from extreme environments such as Antarctica may lead to an important
   advancement in therapeutic applications with fewer side effects.},

Abstract = {During three austral summer seasons, dust and soil from clothes, boots
   and equipment of members of scientific expeditions and tourists visiting
   the Polish Antarctic Station Henryk Arctowski were collected and
   analysed for the presence of fungal propagules. Of a total of 60
   samples, 554 colonies of fungi belonging to 19 genera were identified.
   Colonies of the genus Cladosporium, Penicillium and non-sporulating
   fungus (Mycelia sterilia) dominated in the examined samples. The
   microbiological assessment of air for the presence of fungi was also
   conducted at two points in the station building and two others outside
   the station. A total of 175 fungal colonies belonging to six genera were
   isolated. Colonies of the genus Penicillium were the commonest in the
   air samples. The potential epidemiological consequences for indigenous
   species as a result of unintentional transport of fungal propagules to
   the Antarctic biome are discussed in the light of rapid climate change
   in some parts of the Antarctic and adaptation of fungi to extreme
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Although dark septate fungal endophytes (DSE) occur widely in
   association with plant roots in cold-stressed habitats, little is known
   of the taxonomic status of DSE in Antarctica. Here we investigate the
   phylogenetic affinities of DSE colonising the roots of Colobanthus
   quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, the two maritime Antarctic
   vascular plant species. Two hundred and forty-three DSE were isolated
   from roots collected from 17 sites across a 1470 km transect through
   maritime and sub-Antarctica. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene
   cluster of representative isolates was sequenced, and the sequences were
   recovered in 10 sequence groups and sub-groups. Nine of the sequence
   groupings could be placed in the Helotiales and the remaining one showed
   high homology to a large number of currently unassigned anamorphic
   ascomycete sequences. Of the Helotiales, Leptodontidium orchidicola,
   Rhizoscyphus ericae and species of Tapesia and Mollisia could be
   confidently identified. This study demonstrates that members of the
   Helotiales, including several widely-recognised DSE genera, commonly
   colonise the roots of C. quitensis and D. antarctica in the Antarctic.

   positions and breadths of a functionally important group of eukaryotic
   soil microbes, ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. We compiled high-quality EM
   fungal sequence data from 26 forested sites in Japan (with mean annual
   temperatures ranging from 1.6 to 23.6 degrees C) to create temperature
   niche profiles for each individual fungal species. Nested theory and a
   newly developed weighted-randomization null model were applied to 75
   fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with high occurrence records
   to examine potential preferences for certain temperature positions and
   breadths. Our analyses revealed that (a) many EM fungal OTUs were
   restricted to habitats with low mean annual temperatures, (b) fungal
   OTUs observed at colder sites exhibited narrower temperature breadths
   than expected by chance, (c) the composition of EM fungal OTUs exhibited
   a nested pattern along the temperature gradient, and (d) EM fungal
   richness was highest at colder sites, where the greatest degree of
   overlap in OTU occurrence was observed. These findings imply that future
   warming may limit the distribution of many EM fungal species that are
   currently adapted to only cold climates. This could eventually reduce EM
   fungal biodiversity, which is linked to forest function through
   symbiotic associations with trees. This study demonstrates the
   distribution and environmental ranges of various EM fungal species and
   can contribute to develop species distribution models with the aim of
   conserving microbes in the face of climate change.},

Abstract = {The ste1 gene encoding a steryl esterase was isolated from the
   thermophilic fungus Melanocarpus albomyces. The gene has one intron, and
   it encodes a protein consisting of 576 amino acids. The deduced amino
   acid sequence of the steryl esterase was shown to be related to lipases
   and other esterases such as carboxylesterases. Formation of mature
   protein requires post-translational removal of a putative 18-amino-acid
   signal sequence and a 13-residue propeptide at the N-terminus. The
   intronless version of the Melanocarpus albomyces ste1 gene was expressed
   in Pichia pastoris under the inducible AOX1 promoter. The production
   level was low, and a large proportion of the total activity yield was
   found to be present intracellularly. However, the fact that steryl
   esterase activity was produced by P. pastoris cells carrying the
   expression cassette confirmed that the correct gene had been cloned. The
   stet gene was subsequently expressed in T reesei under the inducible
   cbh1 promoter, and a clearly higher production level was obtained. About
   60\% of the total activity was bound to the fungal mycelium or to solid
   components of the culture medium, or existed as aggregates. Triton X-100
   was successfully used to recover this activity. The heterologous
   production system in T. reesei provides a means of producing M.
   albomyces steryl esterase STE1 reliably in large scale for future
   studies. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Penicillium psychrofluorescens sp. nov., a naturally
   autofluorescent Antarctic fungus},
Journal = {MYCOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON FUNGAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 30},
Abstract = {A new fungal species, Penicillium psychrofluorescens sp. nov. is
   described as a member of section Torulomyces. The new species is sister
   to P. catalonicum, and was isolated from soil collected from Robinson
   Ridge, East Antarctica, following enrichment cultivation under
   oligotrophic conditions supplemented with excess hydrogen gas.
   Penicillium psychrofluorescens is named for its intense autofluorescence
   derived from a combination of compounds that may include NADPH,
   porphyrins, and secondary metabolites, such as polyketides. Comparative
   genomics with both Antarctic and mesophilic Penicillium spp. shows that
   Penicillium psychrofluorescens has a wide repertoire of glycoside
   hydrolases, but almost no polysaccharide lyases, has comparably large
   effector proteins, lacks the machinery to use nitrate as an N-source,
   but has the genes for the assimilation of phosphorus from phosphonates
   via oxidative pathway. The strain was found to have 30 biosynthetic gene
   clusters (BGCs), the majority of which were unrelated to known compound
   BGCs. Given the remarkable diversity of natural products already
   characterised from Penicillium spp. and the presence of >30 BGCs with
   low similarity to known genes, there is biotechnological potential
   within this novel species that is yet to be explored.},

Title = {Antarctic Extremophiles: Biotechnological Alternative to Crop
   Productivity in Saline Soils},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Salinization of soils is one of the main sources of soil degradation
   worldwide, particularly in arid and semiarid ecosystems. High salinity
   results in osmotic stress and it can negatively impact plant grow and
   survival. Some plant species, however, can tolerate salinity by
   accumulating osmolytes like proline and maintaining low Na+
   concentrations inside the cells. Another mechanism of saline stress
   tolerance is the association with symbiotic microorganism, an
   alternative that can be used as a biotechnological tool in susceptible
   crops. From the immense diversity of plant symbionts, those found in
   extreme environments such as Antarctica seems to be the ones with most
   potential since they (and their host) evolved in harsh and stressful
   conditions. We evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a consortium
   of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPB) and endosymbiotic fungi
   isolated from an Antarctic plant on saline stress tolerance in different
   crops. To test this we established 4 treatments: (i) uninoculated plants
   with no saline stress, (ii) uninoculated plants subjected to saline
   stress (200 mM NaCl), (iii) plants inoculated with the microorganism
   consortium with no saline stress, and (iv) inoculated plants subjected
   to saline stress. First, we assessed the effect of symbiont consortium
   on survival of four different crops (cayenne, lettuce, onion, and
   tomato) in order to obtain a more generalized response of this
   biological interaction. Second, in order to deeply the mechanisms
   involved in salt tolerance, in lettuce plants we measured the
   ecophysiological performance (F-v/F-m) and lipid peroxidation to
   estimate the impact of saline stress on plants. We also measured proline
   accumulation and NHX1 antiporter gene expression (involved in Na+
   detoxification) to search for possible mechanism of stress tolerance.
   Additionally, root, shoot, and total biomass was also obtained as an
   indicator of productivity. Overall, plants inoculated with
   microorganisms from Antarctica increased the fitness related traits in
   several crops. In fact, three of four crops selected to assess the
   general response increased its survival under salt conditions compared
   with those uninoculated plants. On the other hand, saline stress
   negatively impacted all measured trait, but inoculated plants were
   significantly less affected. In control osmotic conditions, there were
   no differences in proline accumulation and lipid peroxidation between
   inoculation treatments. Interestingly, even in control salinity, F-v/F-m
   was higher in inoculated plants after 30 and 60 days. Under osmotic
   stress, F-v/F-m, proline accumulation and NHX1 expression was
   significantly higher and lipid peroxidation lower in inoculated plants
   compared to uninoculated individuals. Moreover, inoculated plants
   exposed to saline stress had a similar final biomass (whole plant)
   compared to individuals under no stress. We conclude that Antarctic
   extremophiles can effectively reduce the physiological impact of saline
   stress in a salt-susceptible crops and also highlight extreme
   environments such as Antarctica as a key source of microorganism with
   high biotechnological potential.},

   their stability under space and Mars-like conditions, while at the same
   time investigating the survival capability of microorganisms. The
   experiment has been launched into space and is being exposed on the
   EXPOSE-R2 payload, outside of the International Space Station (ISS) over
   a time-span of 1.5 years. Along with a number of other extremophilic
   microorganisms, the Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces
   antarcticus CCFEE 515 has been included in the experiment. Before
   launch, dried colonies grown on Lunar and Martian regolith analogues
   were exposed to vacuum, irradiation and temperature cycles in ground
   based experiments (EVT1 and EVT2). Cultural and molecular tests revealed

   caesiella, Peccania cernohorskyi, Rhizoplaca melanophthahna, Thelocarpon
   imperceptum,Verrucaria ulmi and Xanthoria papillifera. Eight species
   (mainly from lowland forests) have not been found over 70 or more years
   from the territory of the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Four species were
   reported in the past but were omitted from the current national
   checklists. Other species new to the explored countries are Bacidia

Title = {Basal ice formation in snow cover in Northern Finland between 1948 and
   2016},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Basal ice formation in the terrestrial snow cover is a common phenomenon
   in northern circumpolar areas, onehaving significant impacts on
   ecosystems, vegetation, animals and human activities. There is limited
   knowledge on the spatial and temporal occurrence of basal ice formation
   because of the sparse observation network and challenges involved in
   detecting formation events. We present a unique dataset on the annual
   extent of ice formation events in northern Finland between 1948 and 2016
   based on reindeer herders' descriptions of the cold season in their
   management reports. In extreme years, basal ice can form over wide
   geographical extents. In approximately half of the herding districts
   studied, it occurred more frequently in the period 1983-2016 than in the
   period 1948-1982. Furthermore, five out of seven of the most extensive
   basal ice formation events (90th percentile) occurred between 1991 and
   2016. Themost commonly reported processes related to ice formation were
   thaw or rain-on-snow events followed by freezing of the snow cover.
   Years with extensive basal ice formation were often characterized by
   above-average October-December air temperatures, air temperature
   variations around 0 degrees C and relatively high precipitation.
   However, basal ice did not occur during all warm and wet early winters,
   and formation events were generally weakly linked to the large-scale
   atmospheric teleconnections. Another risk factor for reindeer grazing
   associated with warm and rainy earlywinters is the growth of
   mycotoxin-producing molds below the snow. Approximately 24\% of all
   reported mold formation events co-occurred with basal ice formation. The
   prevalence and frequency of basal ice formation events can be assessed
   based on our results. Ourwork contributes to understanding long-term
   fluctuations and changes in snow and ice conditions and the impacts of
   this variability in circumpolar areas.},

Abstract = {Twenty-seven strains of basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia spp. were collected
   from lake sediment and soil surrounding the lakes in the Skarvsnes area,
   East Antarctica. Based on sequence similarity of their ribosomal
   internal transcribed spacer regions and D1/D2 domains, the isolated
   strains were classified into three species; Mrakia blollopis (18
   strains), M. gelida (7 strains), and M. robertii (2 strains). All of the
   strains produced ethanol from glucose at 10 degrees C. Six strains
   selected from the 27 isolates were then tested for ethanol fermentation
   and ethanol tolerance at 100 g/l glucose. Mrakia blollopis SK-4 and M.
   blollopis NRI-4 completely consumed the glucose within 13 d and 6 d of
   fermentation respectively, and demonstrated high ethanol yields and
   ethanol tolerance. In contrast, M. blollopis AGK-3 and M. blollopis
   TKG1-2 exhibited low ethanol yields and poor ethanol tolerance. These
   results indicate that ethanol yields of different Mrakia species may
   depend on ethanol tolerance in individual strains. (C) 2015 The

Title = {The potential of cold-adapted microorganisms for biodegradation of
   bioplastics},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {72-81},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Due to the extensive use of plastics, their quantity in the environment
   is constantly increasing, which creates a global problem. In the present
   study, we sought to isolate, test and identify Antarctic microorganisms
   which possess the ability to biodegrade bioplastics such as
   poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) and
   poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA) at low temperatures.
   161 bacterial and 38 fungal isolates were isolated from 22 Antarctic
   soil samples. Among them, 92.16\% of bacterial and 77.27\% of fungal
   isolates formed a clear zone on emulsified PBSA, 98.04\% and 81.82\% on
   PBS and 100\% and 77.27\% on PCL as an additive to minimal medium at 20
   degrees C.
   Based on the 16S and 18S rRNA sequences, bacterial strains were
   identified as species belonging to Pseudomonas and Bacillus and fungal
   strains as species belonging to Geomyces, Sclerotinia, Fusarium and
   Mortierella, while the yeast strain was identified as Hansenula anomala.
   In the biodegradation process conducted under laboratory conditions at
   14, 20 and 28 degrees C, Sclerotinia sp. B11IV and Fusarium sp. B30M
   strains showed the highest biodegradation activity at 20 degrees C
   (49.68\% for PBSA and 33.7\% for PCL, 45.99\% for PBSA and 49.65\% for
   PCL, respectively). The highest biodegradation rate for Geomyces sp.
   B10I was noted at 14 degrees C (25.67\% for PBSA and 5.71\% for PCL),
   which suggested a preference for lower temperatures (at 20 degrees C the
   biodegradation rate was only 11.34\% for PBSA, and 4.46\% for PCL).
   These data showed that microorganisms isolated from Antarctic regions
   are good candidates for effective plastic degradation at low
   temperatures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {LIFE-BASEL},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {The search for life beyond Earth currently hinges on the detection of
   biosignatures that are indicative of current or past life, with
   terrestrial life being the sole known example. Deoxyribonucleic acid
   (DNA), which acts as the long-term storage of genetic information in all
   known organisms, is considered a biosignature of life. Techniques like
   the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are particularly useful as they
   allow for the amplification of DNA fragments, allowing the detection of
   even trace amounts of genetic material. This study aimed to detect DNA
   extracted from colonies of an Antarctic black fungus both when (i) alone
   and (ii) mixed with a Sulfatic Mars Regolith Simulant (S-MRS), after
   exposure to increasing doses of Fe ions (up to 1 kGy). PCR-based
   amplification methods were used for detection. The findings of this
   study revealed no DNA amplification in samples mixed with Sulfatic Mars
   Regolith Simulant, providing important insights into the potential
   application of these techniques for in situ DNA detection during future
   space exploration missions or for their application on the Mars sample
   return program; it also gives input in the planetary protection
   discussions.},

Abstract = {Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems are largely dominated by lichens, while
   shallow coastal environments are mainly covered by macroalgae. The aim
   of this study was to isolate and to evaluate the diversity of yeasts in
   different species of macroalgae and lichens collected in South Shetland
   Islands, Antarctica. A total of 405 yeasts were recovered (205 from
   macroalgae and 200 from lichens). The yeast community from macroalgae
   was most diversity than the yeast community from lichen. The dominance
   index was similar for both substrates. A total of 24 taxa from
   macroalgae and 18 from lichens were identified, and only 5 were common
   to both substrates. Metschnikowia australis, Mrakia sp., Rhodotorula
   glacialis and Glaciozyma litorale were the most abundant yeasts in
   macroalgae and Cryptococcus victoriae, Rhodotorula laryngis, Rhodotorula
   arctica, Trichosporon sp. 1 and Mrakia sp. were the most abundant in
   lichens. Based on molecular and phylogenetic analyses, four yeast from
   macroalgae and six from lichens were considered potential new species.
   This is the first study to report the yeast communities from the
   Antarctic macroalgae Himantothallus grandifolius and lichen Ramalina
   terebrata. Results suggest that Antarctic phyco and lichensphere
   represent a huge substrate for cold-adapted yeasts and enhanced the
   knowledge of the microbiota from extreme environments.},

Title = {Adding complexity to soil food webs: Myxobacteria have broad predation
   spectra with bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi in vitro},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {In the multifaceted soil habitat, predation is one of the most
   successful strategies for obtaining food. An example of prokaryotic
   predators is myxobacteria. Although the prey spectra of some
   myxobacteria have been the subject of numerous studies, these
   myxobacteria are usually rare in soils compared to other myxobacterial
   families. Consequently, predation assays featuring easily cultivable
   myxobacteria provide only limited information on the myxobacterial
   potential and their interactions with organisms in the soil. Therefore,
   the prey spectrum of representatives of more common families was tested
   and compared with members of the model family Myxococcaceae. In a newly
   developed assay, the extent of lysis was tested against various
   Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, as well as four yeasts. It was
   shown that Kofleria flava and Haliangium ochraceum have an equally
   diverse prey spectrum as the model genera Myxococcus and Corallococcus.
   However, less well-studied myxobacteria often lyse the prey colonies to
   a larger extent. Yeasts were lysed just as efficiently as bacteria.
   Furthermore, it was tested whether different myxobacteria can inhibit
   the growth of filamentous fungi. Almost every strain was able to prevent
   the spread of at least one fungus. H. ochraceum showed the highest
   activity and inhibited all fungi, including plant pathogenic Fusarium.
   These multiple interactions together with the high relative abundance in
   situ, suggest that myxobacteria, especially understudied families, could
   have a more important role in the soil food web than previously thought.
   The individual interaction spectra of the different myxobacteria provide
   only a glimpse at the complex relationships between the organisms in
   soil, which still remain understudied.},

Abstract = {We assessed soil fungal diversity at two sites on Deception Island,
   South Shetland Islands, Antarctica using DNA metabarcoding analysis. The
   first site was a relatively undisturbed area, and the second was much
   more heavily impacted by research and tourism. We detected 346 fungal
   amplicon sequence variants dominated by the phyla Ascomycota,
   Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota and Chytridiomycota. We also detected
   taxa belonging to the rare phyla Mucoromycota and Rozellomycota, which
   have been difficult to detect in Antarctica by traditional isolation
   methods. Cladosporium sp., Pseudogymnoascus roseus, Leotiomycetes sp. 2,
   Penicillium sp., Mortierella sp. 1, Mortierella sp. 2, Pseudogymnoascus
   appendiculatus and Pseudogymnoascus sp. were the most dominant fungi. In
   addition, 440,153 of the total of 1,214,875 reads detected could be
   classified only at the level of Fungi. In both sampling areas the DNA of
   opportunistic, phytopathogenic and symbiotic fungi were detected, which
   might have been introduced by human activities, transported by birds or
   wind, and/or represent resident fungi not previously reported from
   Antarctica. Further long-term studies are required to elucidate how
   biological colonization in the island may be affected by climatic
   changes and/or other anthropogenic influences.},

Abstract = {Diversity of microorganisms plays an important role in the functioning
   of ecosystems and their response to large-scale environmental changes.
   Microbial soil communities from virgin Haswell Island, Antarctica, were
   studied using the serial dilution-spread plate method at two different
   temperatures. Microorganisms were identified by sporulation,
   morphological, chemotaxonomic assessment. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria
   and microalgae prevailed in the samples. Representatives of
   Chamaesiphon, Dermocarpa, Fischerella, Oscillatoria, Prochlrococcus,
   Synechococcus, Chlorophyta were detected. Fungal assemblages comprised
   Aspergillus nidulans, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Alternaria
   alternata, Mortierella ramanniana, Penicillium verrucosum,
   Scopulariopsis fusca, Cladophialophora minutissima, Chaetomium gracile,
   Phoma herbarum, Phialophora fastigiata, Ulocladium consortiale and
   Candida sp. Actinomycetes were identified by morphological and
   chemotaxonomic assessment of cell-wall aminoacids and sugars as
   Streptomyces, Nocardia and Geodermatophilus. Some of the isolated
   microorganisms formed extracellular enzymes, others biosynthesized
   substances with antifungal and antibacterial activities. Single
   psychrotrophic strains have an ability to grow on n-paraffins and
   naphthalene, and thin-layer chromatographic analyses showed that they
   synthesized glycolipids. Assays for sugar moiety revealed that they
   contained different pentoses such as arabinose, xylose or deoxyhexose as
   rhamnose.},

Abstract = {Aerobiological sampling was conducted year-round at three sites on Signy
   Island, maritime Antarctic, between December 1992 and January 1994, and
   during the summer at a fourth coastal site. The concentrations of
   keratinaceous particles were monitored. Feather fragments were the most
   abundant of all particle types trapped. Seal hairs were also common,
   particularly on the coast. Numbers of both particle types were most
   common in the air in summer. The Antarctic soil fungus Geomyces
   pannorum, which is able to utilize keratin-based substrates, was also
   present in aerobiological samples on Signy Island. G. pannorum was only
   found during early winter on the year-round sampling sites. It was more
   abundant during summer in the air at the coastal site, which was more
   heavily influenced by seals, birds and humans. Skuas were swabbed when
   they returned to the island early in summer. G. pannorum was recovered
   in culture, suggesting that these birds may act as vectors for the
   transport of microorganisms between Antarctica and more northern
   landmasses. Organic material deposited on snow was concentrated on the
   soil at the edge of the ice cap by melt wash, making additional keratin
   and other organic substrates available to soil microorganisms.},

Abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is a common opportunistic pathogen in different
   animals, including birds such as penguins. For the first time, a fungal
   strain identified as A. fumigatus was isolated from soil in the nests of
   gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua, on Livingston Island, South Shetland
   Islands (maritime Antarctica). This isolate (A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829)
   displayed a series of potentially pathogenic characteristics in vitro.
   We evaluated its detailed molecular taxonomy and submitted the A.
   fumigatus UFMGCB 11829 Antarctic strain to in vivo pathogenic modelling.
   The isolate was confirmed to represent A. fumigatus morphological and
   phylogenetic analysis showed that it was closely related to A. fumigatus
   sequences reported from animals, immunosuppressed humans, storage
   grains, plants and soils. The strain displayed the best mycelial growth
   and conidia production at 37 degrees C; however, it was also able to
   grow and produce conidia at 15 degrees, demonstrating its capability to
   survive and colonize penguin nest at least in the summer season in
   maritime Antarctica. In pathogenicity tests, healthy mice did not showed
   symptoms of infection; however, 50\% lethality was observed in
   immunosuppressed mice that were inoculated with 106 and 107 spores.
   Lethality increased to 100\% when inoculated with 108 spores. Our data
   highlight the potential pathogenicity of opportunistic A. fumigatus that
   may be present in the Antarctic, and the risks of both their further
   transfer within Antarctica and outwards to other continents, risks which
   may be exacerbated due global climatic changes.},

Abstract = {We assessed the diversity of culturable fungi associated with rocks of
   continental Antarctica to evaluate their physiological opportunistic
   virulence potential in vitro. The seventy fungal isolates obtained were
   identified as nine species of Acremonium, Byssochlamys, Cladosporium,
   Debaryomyces, Penicillium, and Rhodotorula. Acremonium sp., D. hansenii,
   P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, P. tardochrysogenum, and R. mucilaginosa
   were able to grow at 37 degrees C; in addition, B. spectabilis displayed
   a high level of growth at 37 and 45 degrees C. Thirty-one isolates of P.
   chrysogenum, P. citrinum, and P. tardochrysogenum were able to produce
   partial haemolysis on blood agar at 37 degrees C. Acremonium sp., P.
   citrinum, and P. tardochrysogenum showed spore sizes ranging from 2.81
   to 5.13 mu m diameters at 37 degrees C. Of these, P. chrysogenum and P.
   tardochrysogenum displayed macro- and micro morphological polymorphism.
   Our results suggest that rocks of the ultra-extreme cold and dry

Abstract = {Fungi isolated from environmentally challenging habitats can have
   adaptations of potential value when developed as insect pest-controls.
   Fungal isolates collected from Antarctica, Geomyces sp. I, Geomyces sp.
   II, Mortierella signyensis and M. alpina, were investigated for (i)
   growth characteristics at 0-35 degrees C, (ii) spore production at 10
   and 20 degrees C, (iii) viability following exposure to freezing
   temperatures, and (iv) insecticidal activity against waxmoths (Galleria
   mellonella L.), houseflies (Musca domestica L.), mealworms (Tenebrio
   molitor L.) and black vine weevils (Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fabricius).
   All isolates showed growth between 5-20 degrees C, with some showing
   growth outside this range. Geomyces isolates sporulated over a wider
   range of conditions than the Mortierella isolates. Spore germination at
   10 degrees C was higher for Geomyces sp. II when this isolate was
   produced at 10 compared to 20 degrees C (greatest difference 74.6 vs
   32.7\%). All isolates grew, with the exception of M. alpina, following
   exposure to -20 degrees C for 4 weeks. Insecticidal investigations
   showed M. alpina and M. signyensis caused significant mortality of
   waxmoth and housefly larvae via injection and soil inoculation, and M.
   alpina caused significant mortality of housefly larvae via baiting; the
   Geomyces isolates had little lethal effect.},

Title = {Population genetics and the role of dispersal barriers in the Antarctic
   springtail Kaylathalia klovstadi (Collembola, Isotomidae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {326},

Abstract = {Isolation and extreme environmental conditions have significantly
   impacted terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity in Antarctica, with
   glacial cycles further limiting animal diversity to a small number of
   species. Among these, springtails are relatively abundant, though their
   taxonomic diversity remains low. Antarctic glaciers may serve as major
   dispersal barriers, leading to high levels of genetic divergence among
   isolated populations. In Victoria Land (continental Antarctica), the
   Tucker Glacier has been proposed as an example of such a barrier;
   however, different species or taxa may respond differently to the same
   geographical features. In this study, we tested whether geographic
   distance, major glacier tongues, and seawater channels influence the
   distribution of Kaylathalia klovstadi (Collembola; Isotomidae) in
   Northern Victoria Land. We conducted mitochondrial DNA haplotype
   analysis on fragments of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and ATP
   synthase 6 (atp6) in 62 individuals from six K. klovstadi populations.
   Our analysis provides new insights into the genetic diversity and
   distribution patterns of K. klovstadi by incorporating additional
   sampling sites, specimens, and molecular markers. We challenge previous
   views regarding the role of the Tucker Glacier as a significant physical
   barrier to springtail dispersal in Northern Victoria Land. Our findings
   suggest that the impact of physical barriers on the genetic diversity of
   Antarctic Collembola, including the species studied here, requires a
   more careful evaluation.
   L'isolamento e le condizioni ambientali estreme hanno avuto un impatto
   significativo sulla biodiversit \& agrave; degli invertebrati terrestri
   in Antartide, con i cicli glaciali che hanno ulteriormente limitato la
   diversit \& agrave; animale a un numero ridotto di specie. Tra queste, i
   collemboli sono relativamente abbondanti, sebbene la loro diversit \&
   agrave; tassonomica rimanga bassa. I ghiacciai antartici possono fungere
   da barriere significative per la dispersione delle specie, portando a
   livelli elevati di divergenza genetica tra popolazioni isolate. Nella
   Terra di Vittoria (Antartide continentale), il Ghiacciaio Tucker \&
   egrave; stato proposto come esempio di tali barriere; tuttavia, specie
   diverse di collemboli potrebbero essere influenzate in modo diverso
   dalle stesse caratteristiche geografiche. In questo studio, abbiamo
   valutato se la distanza geografica, i principali ghiacciai e i canali
   d'acqua marina influenzano la distribuzione di Kaylathalia klovstadi
   (Collembola; Isotomidae) nella parte settentrionale della Terra di
   Vittoria. Abbiamo condotto un'analisi aplotipica del DNA mitocondriale

   popolazioni di K. klovstadi. La nostra analisi fornisce nuove
   informazioni sulla diversit \& agrave; genetica e sui modelli di
   distribuzione di K. klovstadi, incorporando siti di campionamento
   aggiuntivi, nuovi esemplari e marcatori molecolari. I risultati mettono
   in discussione il ruolo del Ghiacciaio Tucker come barriera fisica
   significativa per la dispersione di alcune specie di collemboli nella
   parte settentrionale della Terra di Vittoria. I nostri risultati
   suggeriscono che l'impatto delle barriere fisiche sulla diversit \&
   agrave; genetica dei collemboli antartici, inclusa la specie studiata in
   questo caso, debba essere valutato pi \& ugrave; accuratamente.},

Abstract = {Aims The control of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri), causal
   agent of citrus canker, relies heavily on integrated agricultural
   practices involving the use of copper-based chemicals. Considering the
   need for alternatives to control this disease and the potential of fungi
   from extreme environments as producers of bioactive metabolites, we
   isolated and identified a bioactive compound from Penicillium sp. CRM
   1540 isolated from Antarctica marine sediment. Methods and Results The
   potential of compound as an antibacterial agent against X. citri was
   assessed through in vitro and greenhouse experiments. Molecular taxonomy
   indicates that this fungus is a possible new species of Penicillium.
   Results revealed 90\% bacterial inhibition in vitro at 25 mu g ml(-)(1)
   and a decrease in 75.37\% of citrus canker symptoms emergency in vivo in
   treated leaves of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck considering the number of
   lesions per cm(2) (p < 0.05) in comparison with the control. The
   structure of the active agent was identified as penicillic acid based on
   a detailed spectroscopic analysis. Conclusion Penicillic acid can be an
   alternative against citrus canker. Significance and Impact of Study
   Research into extremophile micro-organisms can identify molecules with
   biotechnological potential and alternatives to current agricultural
   practices.},

Title = {Cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) of Pseudomonas putida MCCC 1A00316 Isolated from
   Antarctic Soil: Identification and Characterization of Activity against
   Meloidogyne incognita},

Abstract = {Pseudomonas putida MCCC 1A00316 was originally isolated from an
   Antarctic soil and has demonstrated potential nematicidal activity.
   Thus, it has promising applications for the biological control of
   Meloidogyne incognita. The larval mortality and egg-hatching inhibition
   rates of M. incognita will increase with the rising concentration of
   culture filtrates of P. putida MCCC 1A00316 and the duration of
   exposure. Thus, this study aimed to separate, purify, and identify
   nematicidal compounds from P. putida MCCC 1A00316 and to validate their
   anti-M. incognita activities. Compounds were purified through silica gel
   column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography combined with
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Structural identification
   was conducted through liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
   C-13-NMR, and Marfey's method. The isolated compounds were identified as
   cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) on the basis of the results of the above analyses and
   previously reported data. The effects of various concentrations of
   cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) on the mortality rates of second-stage juveniles (J2)
   of M. incognita were investigated. Results showed that HPLC-purified
   cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) displayed nematicidal activities. The mortality rate
   of M. incognita J2 reached 84.3\% after 72 h of exposure to 67.5 mg/L
   cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu). The lowest egg-hatching rate (9.74\%) was observed
   after 8 days of incubation with 2000 mg/L cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu). An
   egg-hatching rate of 53.11\% was obtained under the control treatment
   (sterile distilled water). However, cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) did not elicit
   chemotaxis activity to M. incognita. This is the first work to
   investigate the anti-M. incognita characteristics of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu).},

Abstract = {A wide diversity of micromycetes from various taxonomic groups in acidic
   and neutral soils is known from the literature data. In the present
   work, the fungi isolated from these soils and capable of growth at high
   pH are analyzed. The fungi were isolated from acidic sod-podzol and
   neutral cultivated soils by plating on alkaline agar (pH 10.0-10.5).
   Their identification was carried out using morphological, cultural, and
   molecular genetic criteria. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and the
   rates of linear growth within a broad pH range (4.0-10.4) were
   determined. The isolates represented a polyphyletic group of ascomycetes
   (Sordariomycetes), which included members of Plectosphaerellaceae (5
   species) and various families of Hypocreales (4 species). The most
   common species were Gibellulopsis nigrescens, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus,
   Chordomyces antarcticum, and Plectosphaerella spp. Investigation of
   fungal growth at different pH values revealed all isolates to be
   alkalitolerant, with no alkaliphilic fungi isolated from acidic
   sod-podzol and neutral cultivated soils. Although the group of isolates
   was polyphyletic and its members originated from different ecological
   and trophic niches, most alkalitolerant isolates exhibited common
   morphological traits with acremonium- and verticillium-like conidial
   spore formation, abundant slime formation, and a tendency for
   aggregation of their mycelium in bundles. Our research confirmed the
   presence of fungi with alkalitolerant adaptation to external pH in the
   sod-podzolic and cultivated soils of the Moscow region.},

Abstract = {Extremely acidic soils (pH < 3) harbour mycobiota that are different
   from less acidic habitats and are dominated by a small number of fungal
   species. During investigation of the mycobiota of highly acidic soils in
   the Czech Republic and Iceland, a group of melanised fungal isolates was
   obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS
   region, SSU, LSU), the isolates were accommodated by three phylogenetic
   lineages within the family Teratosphaeriaceae (Capnodiales,
   Dothideomycetes). The first lineage is here described as a new
   acidotolerant genus and species Acidiella bohemica gen. nov. et sp. nov.
   The most closely related species to this new clade are other
   extremotolerant fungi isolated from rocks and lichens collected in the
   Alps and Antarctica as well as leaf-spotting species and opportunistic
   human pathogens. The isolates belonging to the second and the third
   lineages were identified as the recently described acidophilic fungi
   Acidomyces acidophilus and Teratosphaeria acidotherma, respectively. The
   taxonomic status of both sister species is discussed and the latter
   species is ascribed here to the genus Acidomyces.},

Abstract = {Two species of coniferous silicified wood are described from the El
   Freno Formation (Lower Jurassic) at Cerro La Brea, on the southern
   margin of the Atuel River, southern Mendoza Province, Argentina.
   Agathoxylon liguaensis Torres and Philippe (Araucariaceae) and the new
   species Podocarpoxylon atuelensis sp. nov. (Podocarpaceae) were
   described based on a detailed description of the secondary xylem. Wood
   specimens are well preserved, although some sections display variably
   decaying cell-walls typical of white-rotting by extant fungi. Vegetative
   and sexual structures in the degraded areas are identifiable as
   basidiomycetes. This is consistent with fungal saprotrophism and
   supports the role of fungi in the recycling of the organic matter in
   Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems. Considering the available
   geochronologic and biostratigraphic data and the current
   lithostratigraphic settings proposed for the unit, the age of the El
   Freno Formation at the studied locality can be constrained to the
   Hettangian-Sinemurian.},

Title = {Ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species participate in enzymatic
   oxidation of humus in northern forest ecosystems},

Abstract = {In northern forests, belowground sequestration of nitrogen (N) in
   complex organic pools restricts nutrient availability to plants.
   Oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi may
   aid plant N acquisition by providing access to N in macromolecular
   complexes. We test the hypotheses that ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius
   species produce Mn-dependent peroxidases, and that the activity of these
   enzymes declines at elevated concentrations of inorganic N.
   In a boreal pine forest and a sub-arctic birch forest, Cortinarius DNA
   was assessed by 454-sequencing of ITS amplicons and related to
   Mn-peroxidase activity in humus samples with- and without previous N
   amendment. Transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes was
   investigated in field samples. Phylogenetic analyses of Cortinarius
   peroxidase amplicons and genome sequences were performed.
   We found a significant co-localization of high peroxidase activity and
   DNA from Cortinarius species. Peroxidase activity was reduced by high
   ammonium concentrations. Amplification of mRNA sequences indicated
   transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes under field conditions.
   The Cortinarius glaucopus genome encodes 11 peroxidases - a number
   comparable to many white-rot wood decomposers.
   These results support the hypothesis that some ectomycorrhizal fungi -
   Cortinarius species in particular - may play an important role in
   decomposition of complex organic matter, linked to their mobilization of
   organically bound N.},

Abstract = {The Antarctic fungus Cadophora malorum produces previously undescribed
   cyclic heptapeptides (cadophorin A and B) containing an anthranilic acid
   residue. The planar structure of these peptides was determined by
   high-resolution mass spectrometry combined with extensive 1D and 2D NMR
   spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of the amino acids was
   determined by Marfey's method, with HPLC analysis of FDVA (N
   alpha-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorphenyl)-L-valinamide) derivatives making use
   of a PFP column. Remarkably, cadophorin 2 possesses both the uncommon
   D-Ile and D-allo-Ile in its structure. The peptides have metal binding
   properties as shown by LCMS with post column addition of metal salt
   solutions. These results were supported by DFT calculations.},

Title = {Diversity, Distribution, and Ecology of Fungi in the Seasonal Snow of
   Antarctica},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We characterized the fungal community found in the winter seasonal snow
   of the Antarctic Peninsula. From the samples of snow, 234 fungal
   isolates were obtained and could be assigned to 51 taxa of 26 genera.
   Eleven yeast species displayed the highest densities; among them,
   Phenoliferia glacialis showed a broad distribution and was detected at
   all sites that were sampled. Fungi known to be opportunistic in humans
   were subjected to antifungal minimal inhibition concentration.
   Debaryomyces hansenii, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Penicillium
   chrysogenum, Penicillium sp. 3, and Penicillium sp. 4 displayed
   resistance against the antifungals benomyl and fluconazole. Among them,
   R. mucilaginosa isolates were able to grow at 37 degrees C. Our results
   show that the winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula contains a
   diverse fungal community dominated by cosmopolitan ubiquitous fungal
   species previously found in tropical, temperate, and polar ecosystems.
   The high densities of these cosmopolitan fungi suggest that they could
   be present in the air that arrives at the Antarctic Peninsula by air
   masses from outside Antarctica. Additionally, we detected environmental
   fungal isolates that were resistant to agricultural and clinical
   antifungals and able to grow at 37 degrees C. Further studies will be
   needed to characterize the virulence potential of these fungi in humans
   and animals.},

Abstract = {Extremely acidic soils (pH < 3) harbour poorly diversified mycobiota
   that are very different from less acidic habitats. During investigations
   of the mycobiota from several highly acidic soils in the Czech Republic
   and a coastal site in the Antarctic Peninsula, a group of hyaline fungal
   isolates was obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA
   sequences (ITS region, SSU, LSU), the isolates belonged to three
   phylogenetic lineages within two different classes, Sordariomycetes and
   Leotiomycetes (Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). The first lineage is
   described here as a new genus and species Acidothrix acidophila gen.
   nov. et sp. nov. (Amplistromataceae, Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota). The
   most closely related species to this new clade are wood-inhabiting
   fungi. The isolates belonging to the second and the third lineages are
   also described as two new genera and species Acidea extrema gen. nov. et
   sp. nov. and Soosiella minima gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Helotiales,
   Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota). Their position and the relationships within
   Helotiales are discussed. Soosiella minima was acidotolerant, Acidothrix
   acidophila and Acidea extrema exhibited both acidotolerant and
   acidophilic characteristics. All the species were slightly halophilic.
   The adaptation of hyaline fungi from mesophilic lineages to highly
   acidic environments has been revealed. The association between highly
   acidic and Antarctic habitats is discussed.},

   principal incitant of aspergillosis among penguins in captivity, this
   represents the 1st report of its presence in antarctic materials. A.
   flavus and A. ustus were also found in the Hallett samples. In a
   comparable number of soil and guano samples from isolated Adelie
   rookeries on Foyn Island and Possession Island, these fungi were not
   encountered. Their presence at Hallett Station may be the result of
   human contamination. A brief consideration of epidemiological

Abstract = {. We expanded our knowledge of the Cladonia cariosa group by seeking out
   and sequencing squamulose epodetiate Cladonia specimens in western North
   America. Cladonia galindezii, a species in the Cladonia cariosa group
   with large squamules forming thick mats and often containing porphyrilic
   acid, as in the type specimen from Antarctica, was found in several
   western states, new to the United States. In the same clade were
   specimens with atranorin only or atranorin with norstictic acid. We also
   establish Cladonia andereggii as another species in the C. cariosa
   group, from Idaho and Washington, based on sequencing new specimens from
   near the type locality. Although C. andereggii resembles C. symphycarpa
   in having norstictic acid-containing medium-sized squamules, ITS
   sequences of C. andereggii showed that it is more closely related to C.
   cariosa than to C. symphycarpa. We also demonstrated chemical diversity
   in the remainder of the C. cariosa group in western North America, with
   five chemotypes, all with atranorin, most frequently with atranorin
   only, less frequently with porphyrilic acid, homosekikaic acid,
   norstictic acid, or fumarprotocetraric acid, some of these in
   combination with rangiformic acid. While C. andereggii consistently
   contained norstictic acid and atranorin, C. galindezii and the remainder
   of C. cariosa s.l. varied in major substances.},

Title = {Characterisation of lipase fatty acid selectivity using novel omega-3
   pNP-acyl esters},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {259-269},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Lipases have applications for the industrial processing of lipids,
   including concentrating and/or modifying fish oil derived omega-3 fatty
   acids, widely used as nutritional supplement and functional food
   ingredients. A range of para-nitrophenol (pNP) acyl esters were
   synthesised as a means to rapidly screen lipases for fatty acid
   selectivity using spectrophotometric detection. The chosen esters were
   based primarily on the most abundant fatty acids present in anchovy and
   tuna oils. pNP derivatives of C16:1 n-7, C18:1 n-9 (OA), C18:2 n-6 (LA),
   C18:3 n-3 (ALA), C20:5 n-3 (EPA) and C22:6 n-3 (DMA) were synthesised.
   Storage stability of these pNP derivatives was shown to be at least 6
   months and all pNP derivatives, including those of EPA and DHA, were
   shown to be stable throughout the conditions of the assay. We applied
   the new assay substrates for the determination of fatty acid selectivity
   of five widely utilised lipases. Results showed that the lipase from
   Candida rugosa was the most selective in terms of omega-3 specificity,
   preferentially hydrolysing all other medium long-chain substrates.
   Lipases from Rhizomucor miehei and Thermomyces lanuginosa also showed
   selectivity, with a significant preference for saturated fatty acids.
   Candida antarctica lipase B and Aspergillus niger lipase were the least
   selective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {40},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1657-1664},
Abstract = {The Antarctic cryptoendolithic fungi of the ice-free desert could have
   evolved genetically and geographically isolated since the separation of
   the Continent from the Gondwanaland. The resulting harsh environmental
   conditions due to the migration of Antarctica to the South Pole led to a
   strong selective pressure possibly promoting adaptive radiation and
   speciation. Microorganisms evolved during this unique process are
   adapted to colonize what is known as the closest Martian environment on
   Earth. For this reason they have been already suggested as the best
   eukaryotic model for exobiological speculations. The results on freeze
   and thawing, UV exposure and osmotic stress tolerance here reported
   highlight an uncommon ability of surviving under these external
   pressures. Studies on their ability to withstand space conditions are in
   progress in view of the opportunity of direct space exposure on the
   International Space Station. The results could give new tools to solve
   the conflict concerning the Panspermia hypothesis. (c) 2007 COSPAR.

Abstract = {Dust has been widely recognised as an important source of nutrients in
   the marine environment and as a vector for transporting pathogenic
   microorganisms. Disturbingly, in the wake of a dust storm event along
   the eastern Australian coast line in 2009, the Continuous Plankton
   Recorder collected masses of fungal spores and mycelia (\~{}150,000
   spores/m(3)) forming a floating raft that covered a coastal area
   equivalent to 25 times the surface of England. Cultured A. sydowii
   strains exhibited varying metabolite profiles, but all produced sydonic
   acid, a chemotaxonomic marker for A. sydowii. The Australian marine
   fungal strains share major metabolites and display comparable metabolic
   diversity to Australian terrestrial strains and to strains pathogenic to
   Caribbean coral. Secondary colonisation of the rafts by other fungi,
   including strains of Cladosporium, Penicillium and other Aspergillus
   species with distinct secondary metabolite profiles, was also
   encountered. Our bioassays revealed that the dust-derived marine fungal
   extracts and known A. sydowii metabolites such as sydowic acid,
   sydowinol and sydowinin A adversely affect photophysiological
   performance (F-v/F-m) of the coral reef dinoflagellate endosymbiont
   Symbiodinium. Different Symbiodinium clades exhibited varying
   sensitivities, mimicking sensitivity to coral bleaching phenomena. The
   detection of such large amounts of A. sydowii following this dust storm
   event has potential implications for the health of coral environments
   such as the Great Barrier Reef.},

Abstract = {Increasing interest in the ecological roles, conservation and
   biotechnological potential of Antarctic microbiota has focused attention
   on their biodiversity and evolutionary origins. Antarctic microbial
   ecosystems provide useful models for general questions in evolutionary
   ecology given the relative isolation of the South Polar Region, the
   severe biological constraints imposed by the polar environment, and the
   absence of higher plants and animals in some Antarctic habitats. Sealed
   environments such as Lake Vostok and the overlying East Antarctic ice
   sheet provide unique, natural culture collections for studying
   microorganisms that have been isolated from the global gene pool over
   timescales of evolutionary significance. Most Antarctic environments,
   however, continue to receive microbial propagules from outside the
   region, as indicated by spore trap data, the microflora found in
   Antarctic snow and ice, the colonising taxa at geothermal sites, and the
   high frequency of apparently cosmopolitan species in most habitats.
   Differences in environmental stability and selection pressure among
   environments are likely to influence the degree of adaptive radiation
   and microbial endemism. The latter seems greater in the Southern Ocean
   by comparison with non-marine ecosystems of Antarctica, although there
   is some evidence of endemic species in highly specialised niches on the
   continent such. as in the endolithic habitat and saline lakes.
   Analytical techniques such as 16S rDNA sequencing and DNA-DNA
   hybridisation are beginning to provide new insights into the genetic
   affinities and biodiversity of Antarctic microbiota, and are leading to
   a more rigorous evaluation of microbial endemism.},

Title = {Inference from eDNA-based field distributions vs laboratory analysis of
   isolated strains: physiological performance of non-marine Antarctic
   biota},

Abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) is frequently used to infer distributions of
   microorganisms in Antarctica. Their distributions relative to
   environmental variables are, in turn, sometimes used to infer their
   physiological range (and a relationship between the two is generally
   assumed for conservation purposes). We sought to determine whether
   ecological inferences based on distributions accurately reflect
   tolerances of the organisms concerned, using 249 legacy non-marine
   samples from a latitudinal gradient between 72 and 86 degrees S,
   Antarctica. A cyanobacterium, a heterotrophic bacterium, two eukaryotic
   algae, two fungi, and a moss were isolated into culture, and their field
   distributions inferred using eDNA analysis of the samples above.
   Tolerances of each organism with respect to environmental predictors
   were then inferred from the eDNA distribution and metadata using
   Generalised Additive Models. We then measured growth of the cultured
   isolates in response to a set of these predictors. Laboratory responses
   were then compared to inferences from the eDNA/metadata. Predictions
   from eDNA/metadata agreed with the results of physiological laboratory
   experiments for strains that were detected at high taxonomic resolution
   in the field samples. However, errors were never completely eliminated,
   and direct contradictions occurred when strains were represented at
   lower taxonomic resolution in the field data. We found that accurate
   ecological inference from eDNA studies would be best achieved via
   maximising both taxonomic resolution (through marker choice/read length)
   and ecological signal (through careful sampling design and rigorous
   metadata collection).},

Title = {Ecological niche drives fungal and bacterial diversity in endolithic and
   epilithic communities inhabiting granites in Victoria Land, Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Antarctic continent harbors unique ecosystems, including diverse
   microbial communities inhabiting rocky substrates. Despite extensive
   research on Antarctic microbial ecology, a gap in knowledge persists
   regarding the comparative analysis of microbial communities associated
   with Antarctic granite rocks and the microenvironment created by the
   thalli of the epilithic lichens growing on them. The present study
   addresses this gap. Using high-throughput sequencing approaches we
   conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of fungal and bacterial
   communities colonizing endolithic and epilithic niches on granites in
   Antarctica. Our results revealed distinct differences between endolithic
   and epilithic communities in terms of diversity and composition.
   Lecanoromycetes was the most frequent fungal class in both groups, which
   accounts for 78.5\% in the endolithic and 53.5\% in the epilithic
   samples, respectively. The prevalence of lichenized fungi in both
   habitats suggests their pivotal role in shaping the diversity and
   composition of the Antarctic microbial communities. Endolithic
   communities exhibited higher bacterial diversity, most probably
   influenced by a combination of environmental factors and the complex
   interplay between lichens and other microorganisms. Stress-resistant
   bacterial taxa, as the radioresistant Truepera and Rubrobacter species
   were specifically found in the endolithically colonized specimens,
   suggesting that the endolithic lifestyle promotes a more specific
   ability to adapt throughout environmental extremes. Moreover, the
   endolithic niche in granites seems to positively select cyanobacteria,
   as they were found to play a significant role in endolithic communities,
   demonstrating their adaptability to low-light conditions and their
   importance in nutrient cycling. Overall, our findings shed light on the
   ecological dynamics of microbial communities in extreme environments and
   highlight the importance of further research to elucidate their roles in
   Antarctic ecosystems.},

Journal = {FUNGAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {128},
Number = {8, B},
Pages = {2365-2371},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The surface temperatures of Antarctic soils and bryophyte colonies can
   fluctuate from close to freezing point to approximately 20 degrees C
   under clear skies around solar noon during midsummer. However, whether
   diurnally fluctuating temperatures influence the growth and metabolic
   activities of fungi inhabiting these substrates remains unknown. Here,
   10 isolates of Pseudogymnoascus roseus, an ascomycete that is widespread
   in Antarctica, were exposed in vitro to temperatures fluctuating daily
   from 2 degrees C to 15-24 degrees C. Relative to controls incubated at
   the constant mean temperature of each treatment, temperatures
   fluctuating from 2 degrees C to >= 18 degrees C inhibited the growth of
   all isolates by 10-51\% at 24 h and 48 h, and by up to 79\% for
   individual isolates. Over a period of 21 days, all fluctuating
   temperature treatments reduced mean growth rates by between 3\% and
   48\%, but had few effects on specific (-glucosidase activity, a proxy
   measure for metabolic activity. It is concluded that temperatures
   fluctuating diurnally to >= 18 degrees C during summer in mesic
   Antarctic soils and bryophyte colonies, exacerbated by the occurrence of
   climate-change associated heatwaves, are likely to inhibit the growth of
   P. roseus and perhaps also other ecologically important fungi.},

Abstract = {We characterized the diversity of cultivable fungal assemblages
   associated with the bryospheres of the bipolar mosses Polytrichastrum
   alpinum and Polytrichastrum juniperinum resident in King George Island,
   South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctica. From different parts of the
   mosses, 160 fungal isolates were obtained and identified using molecular
   biology methods as 43 taxa of 28 distinct genera. Antarctomyces
   psychrotrophicus, Mrakia gelida, Pseudogymnoascus sp., Melanodiplodia
   sp., and Vishniacozyma victoriae were the dominant taxa and displayed
   the highest values of frequency. Ecological diversity indices showed
   that the fungal assemblages were high but ranged among the mosses. Fungi
   of the bryospheres of both mosses showed different colonization
   patterns. Only A. psychrotrophicus, M. gelida, Pseudogymnoascus sp., and
   Leotiomycetidae sp. occurred as endophytes, epiphytes, and in the
   rhizoidosphere of P. alpinum. In contrast, the bryosphere of P.
   juniperinum did not show a single common fungus across its different
   portions. Our results show that the bryosphere of the bipolar Antarctic
   mosses seem to represent an interesting hostspot of fungal diversity
   dominated by cosmopolitan cold-adapted and endemic species recognized as
   symbionts and decomposer species. The high fungal diversity detected
   suggests that the Antarctic mosses may offer a protected microhabitat
   (bryosphere) favorable for the survival, dispersal, and colonization of
   symbionts and decomposer fungi in the different extreme environments of
   Antarctica.},

Title = {Multiple, Distinct Intercontinental Lineages but Isolation of Australian
   Populations in a Cosmopolitan Lichen-Forming Fungal Taxon, Psora
   decipiens (Psoraceae, Ascomycota)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Multiple drivers shape the spatial distribution of species, including
   dispersal capacity, niche incumbency, climate variability, orographic
   barriers, and plate tectonics. However, biogeographic patterns of fungi
   commonly do not fit conventional expectations based on studies of
   animals and plants. Fungi, in general, are known to occur across
   exceedingly broad, intercontinental distributions, including some
   important components of biological soil crust communities (BSCs).
   However, molecular data often reveal unexpected biogeographic patterns
   in lichenized fungal species that are assumed to have cosmopolitan
   distributions. The lichen-forming fungal species Psora decipiens is
   found on all continents, except Antarctica and occurs in BSCs across
   diverse habitats, ranging from hot, arid deserts to alpine habitats. In
   order to better understand factors that shape population structure in
   cosmopolitan lichen-forming fungal species, we investigated
   biogeographic patterns in the cosmopolitan taxon P. decipiens, along
   with the closely related taxa P. crenata and P. saviczii. We generated a
   multi-locus sequence dataset based on a worldwide sampling of these taxa
   in order to reconstruct evolutionary relationships and explore
   phylogeographic patterns. Both P. crenata and P. decipiens were not
   recovered as monophyletic; and P. saviczii specimens were recovered as a
   monophyletic clade closely related to a number of lineages comprised of
   specimens representing P. decipiens. Striking phylogeographic patterns
   were observed for P. crenata, with populations from distinct geographic
   regions belonging to well-separated, monophyletic lineages. South
   African populations of P. crenata were further divided into
   well-supported sub-clades. While well-supported phylogenetic
   substructure was also observed for the nominal taxon P. decipiens,
   nearly all lineages were comprised of specimens collected from
   intercontinental populations. However, all Australian specimens
   representing P. decipiens were recovered within a single well-supported
   monophyletic clade consisting solely of Australian samples. Our study
   supports up to 10 candidate species-level lineages in P. decipiens,
   based on genealogical concordance and coalescent-based species
   delimitation analyses. Our results support the general pattern of the
   biogeographic isolation of lichen-forming fungal populations in
   Australia, even in cases where closely related congeners have documented
   intercontinental distributions. Our study has important implications for
   understanding factors influencing diversification and distributions of
   lichens associated with BSC.},

Abstract = {Psychrotrophic yeasts were isolated from Antarctic soils, selected based
   on their ability to grow in apple juice at low temperatures, and were
   evaluated as potential biocontrol agents for the management of
   postharvest diseases of apple during cold storage. Among the species
   recovered, an isolate of Leucosporidium scottii, designated At17, was
   identified as a good biocontrol agent for blue and gray mold of two
   apple cultivars. The selected isolate produced soluble and volatile
   antifungal substances that were inhibitory to apple pathogens.
   Siderophore production was also demonstrated, but it did not appear to
   play a role in pathogen inhibition. The selected yeast had the capacity
   to form a biofilm when grown in apple juice, which is considered an
   important attribute of postharvest antagonists to successfully colonize
   wounds and intact fruit surfaces. At17 was resistant to commonly used
   postharvest fungicides, so application of a combination of low-dose
   fungicide along with the biocontrol agent could be used as an integrated
   management practice.},

Abstract = {Ash from combustion of biofuels, for example wood chips, is often
   deposited as waste, but due to its high content of essential plant
   nutrients and alkalinity, it has been proposed to recycle ash as a
   fertilizer and liming agent in biofuel production forest. However,
   current legislation sets rather strict limitations for wood-ash
   application in biofuel production systems. The soil microfood web, that
   is microorganisms and their microfaunal grazers, protozoa and nematodes,
   is pivotal for essential ecosystem processes such as decomposition and
   plant nutrient release. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the impacts
   on microfood web structure and functioning must precede actions towards
   raising the currently allowed application rates. In a Danish Norway
   spruce plantation, we evaluate the impact of wood ash applied at dosages
   from 0 to the extreme case of 90 t ash ha(-1) on the microfood web, the
   bacterial community structure, soil content of inorganic nitrogen,
   organic matter, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen. Using structural
   equation modelling (SEM), we disentangled the direct effect of the
   disturbance imposed by ash per se, the associated pH increase and
   changes in prey abundance on individual organism groups in the microfood
   web. The SEM showed that the pH rise was the main driver of increasing
   abundances of culturable heterotrophic bacteria with increasing ash
   doses, and via trophical transfer, this also manifested as higher
   abundances of bacterial grazers. Fungal-feeding nematodes were
   unaffected by ash, whereas carnivorous/omnivorous nematodes decreased
   due to the direct effect of ash. Increasing ash doses enhanced the
   difference between bacterial communities of control plots and
   ash-amended plots. The ash-induced stimulation of culturable
   heterotrophic bacteria and bacterial grazers increased inorganic
   nitrogen availability at ash doses of 9 t ha(-1) and above. Hence,
   raised limits for ash application may potentially benefit tree growth
   via enhanced N mineralization activity of the soil food web.},

Abstract = {The evaluation of fungal root endophytes of two multizonal mountain
   plant species (Soldanella carpatica and Homogyne alpine) in relation to
   altitude was conducted. The comparison of root colonization by coarse
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM F) and the fine AMF endophyte (Glomus
   tenue), as well as the presence of dark septate endophytes (DSE) were
   assessed along altitudinal gradients (1000-2050 m a.s.l.) oil calcareous
   and non-calcareous substrata in the Tatra Mts. (Western Carpathians).
   Additionally, AMF species composition in the rhizosphere of the
   investigated plants was determined. Coarse AMIF dominated over the fine
   endophyte in roots of S. carpatica and H. alpina, In the case of S.
   carpatica, there was a tendency for coarse AMF colonization decline with
   increasing altitude, while the reverse trend wits observed for the fine
   endophyte. In contrast, the altitudinal patterns of the two types were
   opposite in H. alpina. Fifteen AMF species associated with the
   rhizosphere of'S. carpatica were identified at the sites located in the
   Western Tatra Mountains, whereas spores of only our species were
   isolated from the rhizosphere of H. alpina in the High Tatra Mountains.
   None of the identified AMF species was observed to occur both in the
   High and Western Tatra Mts. DSE accompanied AMF in the roots of S.
   carpatica and H. alpina at each site: however, the root colonization by
   this group Of fungi was low. The DSE colonization did not have a
   consistent relationship with altitude in both plant species. The results
   suggest that at the investigated altitudes factors such as the type Of
   Substrata, host plants, and local plant species composition may play a
   more important role in determining root colonization as well as the
   establishment of a local AMF Community than the climatic changes with
   increasing elevation above sea level.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the diversity and distribution of viable fungi present in
   permafrost and active layers obtained from three islands of Maritime
   Antarctica. A total of 213 fungal isolates were recovered from the
   permafrost, and 351 from the active layer, which were identified in 58
   taxa; 27 from permafrost and 31 from the active layer. Oidiodendron,
   Penicillium, and Pseudogymnoascus taxa were the most abundant in
   permafrost. Bionectriaceae, Helotiales, Mortierellaceae, and
   Pseudeurotium were the most abundant in the active layer. Only five
   shared both substrates. The yeast Mrakia blollopis represented is the
   first reported on Antarctic permafrost. The fungal diversity detected
   was moderate to high, and composed of cosmopolitan, cold-adapted, and
   endemic taxa, reported as saprobic, mutualistic, and parasitic species.
   Our results demonstrate that permafrost shelters viable fungi across the
   Maritime Antarctica, and that they are contrasting to the overlying
   active layer. We detected important fungal taxa represented by potential
   new species, particularly, those genetically close to Pseudogymnoascus
   destructans, which can cause extinction of bats in North America and
   Eurasia. The detection of viable fungi trapped in permafrost deserves
   further studies on the extension of its fungal diversity and its
   capability to expand from permafrost to other habitats in Antarctica,
   and elsewhere.},

Title = {What can possibly go wrong? The risks of introducing soil microorganisms
   from Antarctica into South America},
Journal = {BOSQUE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {343-346},
Abstract = {Endophytic fungi form mutualistic associations with plant roots which
   can increase plant survival and resistance to stress. Recently, it has
   been proposed that endophytic fungi from Antarctica should be used to
   facilitate reintroduction and establishment of native plants in xeric
   environments of northern Chile. In this note, we suggest this is a risky
   proposition and may lead to biological invasions. It is difficult to
   predict which endophytic fungi will become invasive, where they will
   invade, or what their impacts will be. Organisms that move across
   continents may or may not become invasive depending on the interaction
   between the species and the invaded community; unexpected outcomes may
   occur due to adaptation and novel interactions of the introduced species
   in the new environment. The fact that these endophytes are mutualistic
   does not imply that they will not have negative effects on the recipient
   community, since they might promote invasion of other non-native species
   or may change the competitive relationships among native species.
   Further, taxonomically uncharacterized fungal isolates from plant roots
   are likely to contain non-beneficial species. The fact that these
   endophytic fungi species are from Antarctica does not ensure that they
   cannot invade elsewhere. It should be recognized that invasive
   microorganisms are extremely difficult to control. We strongly suggest
   that the further translocation, use and spread of endophytes from
   Antarctica should be halted until a risk assessment is undertaken.
   Biosecurity measures must be taken when considering transcontinental
   experiments. Based on previous experiences, it is likely that the risk
   and potential costs of introducing these new species significantly
   exceed any potential benefits of their introductions.},

Title = {FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE SILICIFIED HOT SPRING BIOTA FROM A NEW JURASSIC
   CHERT DEPOSIT IN THE DESEADO MASSIF, PATAGONIA, ARGENTINA},

Abstract = {Jurassic hot-spring chert deposits in the Deseado Massif, Patagonia,
   Argentina, have been known for over two decades, but the associated
   biota has only begun to be documented recently, and thus far only from a
   small number of localities. Here we report the discovery of a large
   complex of well-exposed Upper Jurassic epithermal siliceous deposits
   represented by organic-rich cherts preserved within the geothermal
   system from La Bajada, Santa Cruz, Argentina. The chert samples analyzed
   so far contain exceptionally well-preserved, in situ and transported,
   tri-dimensionally silicified plants, animals and microorganisms. Plants
   include equisetaleans (Equisetum thermale), ferns and gymnosperms. Among
   them, well-preserved in situ osmundaceous rhizomes in different
   developmental stages are the dominant component of the taphoflora.
   Conifers are represented by wood, seeds, leaves and pollen tentatively
   assigned to the families Araucariaceae and Cheirolepidiaceae. The
   assemblage also contains vegetative and reproductive structures of
   fungi, oomycetes, cyanobacteria, algae, testate amoebas, ciliates and
   numerous remains of unresolved taxonomic affinity. Microorganisms are
   preserved isolated in the chert matrix or directly associated with
   plants and other organic remains in mutualistic, parasitic and
   saprotrophic engagements. Also present are numerous coprolites and
   arthropod remains that, along with the named microorganisms, are
   indicative of trophic relationships in the ecosystem. Altogether, this
   fossil assemblage suggests that distal paleoenvironments within the
   geothermal system are preserved at La Bajada. The diversity, abundance,
   and exceptional preservation of fossils in the La Bajada ecosystem
   provides a unique window into the geological past that offers a
   substantial contribution to the reconstruction of middle Mesozoic
   terrestrial ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Natural pigments have received special attention from the market and
   industry as they could overcome the harm to health and the environmental
   issues caused by synthetic pigments. These pigments are commonly
   extracted from a wide range of organisms, and when added to products
   they can alter/add new physical-chemical or biological properties to
   them. Fungi from extreme environments showed to be a promising source in
   the search for biomolecules with antimicrobial and antiparasitic
   potential. This study aimed to isolate fungi from Antarctic soils and
   screen them for pigment production with antimicrobial and antiparasitic
   potential, together with other previously isolated strains A total of 52
   fungi were isolated from soils in front of the Collins Glacier
   (Southeast border). Also, 106 filamentous fungi previously isolated from
   the Collins Glacier (West border) were screened for extracellular
   pigment production. Five strains were able to produce extracellular
   pigments and were identified by ITS sequencing as Talaromyces cnidii,
   Pseudogymnoascus shaanxiensis and Pseudogymnoascus sp. All
   Pseudogymnoascus spp. (SC04.P3, SC3.P3, SC122.P3 and ACF093) extracts
   were able to inhibit S. aureus ATCC6538 and two (SC12.P3, SC32.P3)
   presented activity against Leishmania (L.) infantum, Leishmania
   amazonensis and Trypanossoma cruzii. Extracts compounds characterization
   by UPLC-ESI-QToF analysis confirmed the presence of molecules with
   biological activity such as: Asterric acid, Violaceol, Mollicellin,
   Psegynamide A, Diorcinol, Thailandolide A. In conclusion, this work
   showed the potential of Antartic fungal strains from Collins Glacier for
   bioactive molecules production with activity against Gram positive
   bacteria and parasitic protozoas.},

Title = {Diversity, distribution, and xerophilic tolerance of cultivable fungi

Abstract = {We characterized the diversity, distribution, systematic colonization,
   and xerophilic capabilities of fungi associated with the Antarctic
   angiosperms Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica collected
   at different sites of the South Shetlands Islands, Antarctic Peninsula.
   A total of 684 fungal isolates were obtained and identified into 67 taxa
   from 32 genera. The highest fungal diversity and richness were obtained
   from the rhizosphere, roots, and leaves, in order, and only 11 taxa
   shared between both plants. Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus were the
   dominant fungal genera. However, the rarefaction curves for plant fungal
   assemblages did not reach a plateau, suggesting that these Antarctic
   plants may host more fungi in their tissues and rhizospheres. A total of
   460 isolates grew at water activity (a(w)) = 0.95, 200 at 0.90, 110 at
   0.81, and 47 at 0.66. Antarctomyces, Cladosporium, Mortierella,
   Leptosphaeria, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, and Thelebolus taxa grew
   at a(w) = 0.81 and 0.66 and considered highly xerophilic. In addition,
   specific isolates of Penicillium and Thelebolus exhibited the highest
   mycelial growth at a(w) = 0.66. Our results show that the internal
   tissues and rhizosphere of Antarctic angiosperms host rich and diverse
   fungal communities dominated by cold-adapted and endemic taxa, which
   seem to coexist as symbionts and decomposer fungi. In addition, specific
   fungi are able to colonize different parts of the plant, suggesting a
   high ecological relationship with their hosts. Finally, different fungi
   living in the rhizosphere displayed remarkable xerophilic tolerance,
   representing promising candidates for further biotechnological studies,
   including identification of genes for applications in industry and
   agriculture.},

Title = {High diversity and morphological convergence among melanised fungi from
   rock formations in the Central Mountain System of Spain},
Journal = {PERSOONIA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {93-110},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Melanised fungi were isolated from rock surfaces in the Central Mountain
   System of Spain. Two hundred sixty six isolates were recovered from four
   geologically and topographically distinct sites. Microsatellite-primed
   PCIR techniques were used to group isolates into genotypes assumed to
   represent species. One hundred and sixty three genotypes were
   characterised from the four sites. Only five genotypes were common to
   two or more sites. Morphological and molecular data were used to
   characterise and identify representative strains, but morphology rarely
   provided a definitive identification due to the scarce differentiation
   of the fungal structures or the apparent novelty of the isolates.
   Vegetative states of fungi prevailed in culture and in many cases could
   not be reliably distinguished without sequence data. Morphological
   characters that were widespread among the isolates included scarce
   micronematous conidial states, endoconidia, mycelia with dark
   olive-green or black hyphae, and mycelia with torulose, isodiametric or
   monifiform hyphae whose cells develop one or more transverse and/or
   oblique septa. In many of the strains, mature hyphae disarticulated,
   suggesting asexual reproduction by a thallic micronema:our
   conidiogenesis or by simple fragmentation. Sequencing of the internal
   transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2) and 5.8S rDNA gene were employed to
   investigate the phylogenetic affinities of the isolates. According to
   ITS sequence alignments, the majority of the isolates could be grouped
   among four main orders of Pezizomycotina: Pleosporales, Dothideales,
   Capnodiales, and Chaetothyriales. Ubiquitous known soil and epiphytic
   fungi species were generally absent from the rock surfaces. In part, the
   mycota of the rock surfaces shared similar elements with melanised fungi
   from plant surfaces and fungi described from rock formations in Europe
   and Antarctica. The possibility that some of the fungi were lichen
   mycobionts or lichen parasites could not be ruled out.},

Journal = {RESEARCH IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {153},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The filamentous fungus Phoma herbarum CCFEE 5080 isolated from
   continental Antarctica soil was tested for exopolysaccharide (EPS)
   production. The fungus grew and produced EPS (up to 13.6 g/l) on a
   variety of carbon sources among which sorbitol was best, particularly at
   the concentration of 60 g/l. EPS production was maximum when the
   nitrogen source was NaNO3 (3 g/l) and the incubation temperature was 28
   degreesC. The polysaccharide was purified by repeated precipitation in
   ethanol and gel filtration and characterized as a homopolymer of glucose
   having a molecular weight of 7.412 x 10(6); structural analysis
   indicated the presence of beta-1,3 and beta-1,6 linkages only. After
   repeated freezing and thawing of the fungal biomass in the presence of
   EPS, the mycelial growth was much higher than that observed after
   freezing in the absence of EPS and the difference increased with the
   number of freeze-thaw cycles. It is hypothesized that the adaptation of
   P. herbarum CCFEE 5080 to the Antarctic soil microclimatic conditions,
   characterized by low temperature, high thermal fluctuations and repeated
   freeze-thaw cycles, might be related to the EPS production ability. (C)

Title = {Redisposition of acremonium-like fungi in Hypocreales},
Journal = {STUDIES IN MYCOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Number = {105},
Pages = {23-203},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Acremonium is acknowledged as a highly ubiquitous genus including
   saprobic, parasitic, or endophytic fungi that inhabit a variety of
   environments. Species of this genus are extensively exploited in
   industrial, commercial, pharmaceutical, and biocontrol applications, and
   proved to be a rich source of novel and bioactive secondary metabolites.
   Acremonium has been recognised as a taxonomically difficult group of
   ascomycetes, due to the reduced and high plasticity of morphological
   characters, wide ecological distribution and substrate range. Recent
   advances in molecular phylogenies, revealed that Acremonium is highly
   polyphyletic and members of Acremonium s. lat. belong to at least three
   distinct orders of Sordariomycetes, of which numerous orders, families
   and genera with acremonium-like morphs remain undefined. To infer the
   phylogenetic relationships and establish a natural classification for
   acremonium-like taxa, systematic analyses were conducted based on a
   large number of cultures with a global distribution and varied
   substrates. A total of 633 cultures with acremonium-like morphology,
   including 261 ex-type cultures from 89 countries and a variety of
   substrates including soil, plants, fungi, humans, insects, air, and
   water were examined. An overview phylogenetic tree based on three loci
   (ITS, LSU, rpb2) was generated to delimit the orders and families.
   Separate trees based on a combined analysis of four loci (ITS, LSU,
   rpb2, tef-1a) were used to delimit species at generic and family levels.
   Combined with the morphological features, host associations and
   ecological analyses, acremonium-like species evaluated in the present
   study are currently assigned to 63 genera, and 14 families in
   Cephalothecales, Glomerellales and Hypocreales, mainly in the families
   Bionectriaceae, Plectosphaerelaceae and Sarocladiaceae and five new
   hypocrealean families, namely Chrysonectriaceae, Neoacremoniaceae,
   Nothoacremoniaceae, Pseudoniessliaceae and Valsonectriaceae. Among them,
   17 new genera and 63 new combinations are proposed, with descriptions of
   65 new species. Furthermore, one epitype and one neotype are designated
   to stabilise the taxonomy and use of older names. Results of this study
   demonstrated that most species of Acremonium s. lat. grouped in genera
   of Bionectriaceae, including the type A. alternatum. A phylogenetic
   backbone tree is provided for Bionectriaceae, in which 183 species are
   recognised and 39 well-supported genera are resolved, including 10 new
   genera. Additionally, rpb2 and tef-1a are proposed as potential DNA
   barcodes for the identification of taxa in Bionectriaceae.},

Abstract = {Describing the total biodiversity of an environmental metacommunity is
   challenging due to the presence of cryptic and rare species and
   incompletely described taxonomy. How many samples to collect is a common
   issue that faces ecologists when designing fieldwork sampling. Nowadays,
   high-throughput sequencing allows examination of large numbers of
   samples enabling comprehensive biodiversity assessments. In this study,
   we sought to estimate how the scale of sampling affects accuracy of
   community diversity description in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Southern
   Victoria Land) in Antarctica accounted as the closest Martian analogue
   on Earth, exhibiting extreme conditions such as low temperatures, wide
   thermal fluctuations, low nutrient availability and high UV radiation.
   We found that sampling effort, based on accumulation curves and
   statistical analysis, had a considerable impact on assessing species
   richness and composition in these ecosystems, confirming that a sampling
   as large as nine rock specimens was necessary to detect almost all
   fungal species present, but was not sufficient to capture whole
   bacterial assemblage. The sampling would require approximately four
   times more effort (40 samples) for a comprehensive description of
   bacterial diversity. Our findings will be helpful to develop strategies
   to exhaustively describe the microbial diversity of Antarctic
   cryptoendolithic communities.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of microscopic fungi complexes in the
   areas of five Russian polar stations in East Antarctica and the
   Subantarctic. A total of 104 microfungal species have been identified.
   Seventy-seven fungal species have been detected in samples of soils and
   anthropogenic materials from polar stations of East Antarctica
   (Progress, Mirny, Molodezhnaya, and Druzhnaya 4) using mycological
   methods while, in the Bellingshausen station (Subantarctic), we have
   isolated 87 micromycete species. The number of fungi in soils varies
   from individual propagules in control soils to 94000 per 1 g of soil in
   contaminated areas. The largest number of species is represented by the
   genus Penicillium (26 species). Fungal species that form the core of
   mycobiota in most of the studied habitats have been identified. For
   soils of East Antarctica, it is formed by species of the genera
   Aureobasidium, Cadophora, Pseudogymnoascus (Geomyces), Thelebolus, and
   Phoma. Significant differences are established between the mycobiota of
   East Antarctica and that of the Subantarctic. At the same time, a
   general trend towards an increase in fungal species diversity and number
   in the areas of polar stations compared to the control (clean) sites for
   all studied areas is recorded. These data indicate that a significant
   part of micro-mycetes is introduced into the Antarctic by humans
   (anthropogenic invasion).},

Abstract = {During a survey of the culturable soil fungal population in samples
   collected in Taylor Valley, South Victoria Land, Antarctica, 13
   basidiomycetous yeast strains with orange-coloured colonies were
   isolated. Phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and
   partial LSU rRNA gene sequences showed that the strains belong to the
   Dioszegia clade of the Tremellales (Tremellomycetes, Agaricomycotina),
   but did not correspond to any of the hitherto recognized species. Two
   novel species, Dioszegia antarctica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-116(T)
   =CBS 10920(T) =PYCC 5970(T)) and Dioszegia cryoxerica sp. nov. (type
   strain ANT-03-071(T) =CBS 10919(T) =PYCC 5967(T)), are described to
   accommodate ten and three of these strains, respectively. Analysis of
   ITS sequences demonstrated intrastrain sequence heterogeneity in D.
   cryoxerica. The latter species is also notable for producing true hyphae
   with clamp connections and haustoria. However, no sexual structures were
   observed. The two novel species can be considered obligate
   psychrophiles, since they failed to grow above 20 degrees C and grew
   best between 10 and 15 degrees C.},

   Bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, and microalgae occurred. Fungi genera
   Penicillium, Aspergillus, Paecilomyces, Cladosporium, Mortierella,
   Candida, Rhodotorula were found. By morphology and cell wall aminoacid
   composition the actinomycete genus Streptomyces was characterized. The
   bacteria and actinomycetes were screened for biologically active
   products. Some cultures formed enzymes, glycolipids and antibiotics.
   Psychrophilic strain Streptomyces sp. no. 8 was studied more detail and
   was established that it produced following antibiotics: azalomycin B,
   nigericin and non-polyenic macrolide antibiotic composed from two
   components that inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts,

Abstract = {A variety of culturing techniques were employed to isolate fungi from
   maritime Antarctic lakes. Although aquatic hyphomycetes were absent from
   all samples, several soil hyphomycetes were isolated. A variety of
   yeasts (mainly non-fermenting basidiomycetous forms) were also regularly
   encountered in all lake types investigated. Neither hyphomycetes nor
   yeasts were present in exceptional numbers despite the high counts
   previously recorded from surrounding catchment vegetation. In contrast,
   aquatic  phycomycetes were regularly encountered and appear to be
   present in substantial numbers, at least in the shallow margins of the
   lakes. A variety of forms were identified, comprising one
   hyphochytridiomycete, four genera of chytridiomycete and two oomycetes.
   All the fungi isolates obtained appeared to be psychotrophic. Results
   from this preliminary study are discussed in conjunction with data from
   previous Antarctic studies.},

Title = {Stable isotope fingerprinting: a novel method for identifying plant,

Abstract = {Amino acids play an important role in ecology as essential nutrients for
   animals and as currencies in symbiotic associations. Here we present a
   new approach to tracing the origins of amino acids by identifying unique
   patterns of carbon isotope signatures generated by amino acid synthesis
   in plants, fungi, and bacteria ({''}C-13 fingerprints''). We measured
   amino acid delta C-13 from 10 C-3 plants, 13 fungi, and 10 bacteria
   collected and isolated from a boreal forest in interior Alaska, USA,
   using gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry
   (GC-C-IRMS). Microorganisms were cultured under amino-acid-free
   conditions and identified based on DNA sequences. Bacteria, fungi, and
   plants generated consistent, unique C-13 fingerprints based on the more
   complex amino acids (five or more biosynthetic steps) that are
   classified as essential for animals. Linear discriminant analysis
   classified all samples correctly with >99\% certainty and correctly
   classified nearly all insect samples from a previous study by diet. Our
   results suggest that delta C-13 fingerprints of amino acids could
   provide a powerful in situ assay of the biosynthetic sources of amino
   acids and a potential new tool for understanding nutritional linkages in
   food webs.},

Title = {Urea uptake by spruce tree roots in permafrost-affected soils},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {169},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Biomass productivity of black spruce trees is strongly limited by soil
   nitrogen (N) in shallow active layer on permafrost. Trees and
   mycorrhizal roots are known to absorb amino acids to bypass slow N
   mineralization in Nlimited boreal forest soils. However, amino acid
   uptake strategy of tree roots cannot fully explain their advantages in
   competition for soil N with other plants and microbes. We investigated
   the potentials of tree roots to absorb urea as well as amino acids and
   inorganic N, using tracer experiments of 13C, 15N-labelled glutamic acid
   and urea and 15N-labelled ammonium nitrate in black spruce forests
   growing on permafrost-affected soils with different permafrost table
   depths in the eastern edge of the Mackenzie river delta (northwest
   Canada). We demonstrated that black spruce roots have potentials to
   absorb intact urea but only in soils with shallow permafrost, where urea
   accumulates due to limited microbial mineralization activity. This
   contrasts with soils with deep permafrost table, where roots absorb
   amino acids and inorganic N. Allocation of fine roots to colder subsoil
   above permafrost provides advantages for trees monopolizing urea-N.
   Despite lower energy efficiency of urea utilization compared to
   inorganic N and amino acids, urea uptake is one of N acquisition
   strategies for spruce growing on N-limited subarctic soil.},

Title = {Novel endolithic bacteria of phylum Chloroflexota reveal a myriad
   of potential survival strategies in the Antarctic desert},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are dominated by
   nutrient-poor mineral soil and rocky outcrops. The principal habitat for
   microorganisms is within rocks (endolithic). In this environment,
   microorganisms are provided with protection against sub-zero
   temperatures, rapid thermal fluctuations, extreme dryness, and
   ultraviolet and solar radiation. Endolithic communities include lichen,
   algae, fungi, and a diverse array of bacteria. Chloroflexota is among
   the most abundant bacterial phyla present in these communities. Among
   the Chloroflexota are four novel classes of bacteria, here named
   Candidatus Spiritibacteria class. nov. (=UBA5177), Candidatus
   Martimicrobia class. nov. (=UBA4733), Candidatus Tarhunnaeia class. nov.
   (=UBA6077), and Candidatus Uliximicrobia class. nov. (=UBA2235). We
   retrieved 17 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that
   represent these four classes. Based on genome predictions, all these
   bacteria are inferred to be aerobic heterotrophs that encode enzymes for
   the catabolism of diverse sugars. These and other organic substrates are
   likely derived from lichen, algae, and fungi, as metabolites (including
   photosynthate), cell wall components, and extracellular matrix
   components. The majority of MAGs encode the capacity for trace gas
   oxidation using high-affinity uptake hydrogenases, which could provide
   energy and metabolic water required for survival and persistence.
   Furthermore, some MAGs encode the capacity to couple the energy
   generated from H2 and CO oxidation to support carbon fixation
   (atmospheric chemosynthesis). All encode mechanisms for the
   detoxification and efflux of heavy metals. Certain MAGs encode features
   that indicate possible interactions with other organisms, such as
   Tc-type toxin complexes, hemolysins, and macroglobulins.IMPORTANCEThe
   ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the coldest and most
   hyperarid desert on Earth. It is, therefore, the closest analog to the
   surface of the planet Mars. Bacteria and other microorganisms survive by
   inhabiting airspaces within rocks (endolithic). We identify four novel
   classes of phylum Chloroflexota, and, based on interrogation of 17
   metagenome-assembled genomes, we predict specific metabolic and
   physiological adaptations that facilitate the survival of these bacteria
   in this harsh environment-including oxidation of trace gases and the
   utilization of nutrients (including sugars) derived from lichen, algae,
   and fungi. We propose that such adaptations allow these endolithic
   bacteria to eke out an existence in this cold and extremely dry habitat.},

Abstract = {Ochrathinols A and B ((+/-)-1 and (+/-)-2), two undescribed
   sulfur-containing racemates, and ochracids A and B (3 and 4), two

   and B are unprecedented sulfur natural products featuring a novel
   3-methylhex-ahydro-2H-cyclopenta {[}b]thiophene core. Interestingly,
   ochrathinol A ((+/-)-1) outstandingly suppressed the release of
   LPS-induced IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha inflammatory cytokines with
   concentration of 10 mu M and alleviated the unbalanced NAD+/NADH ratio

Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Saxicolous rock ripe lichens that grow on rocks in the East Antarctic
   fellfields were sampled for phylotypic characterization of its
   constituent mycobionts (fungi) and photobionts (algae and
   cyanobacteria). The rock tripe lichen-forming fungal and algal
   phylotypes were classified under the common lichen-forming genera of
   ascomycetes, namely, Umbilicaria, and green algae, namely, Trebouxia and
   Coccomyxa. However, phylotypes of the green algal chloroplasts and the
   lichen-associated cyanobacteria showed unexpectedly high diversity. The
   detected chloroplast phylotypes were not fully affiliated with the green
   algal genera Trebouxia or Coccomyxa. The predominant chloroplast
   phylotype demonstrated maximum resemblance to Neglectella solitaria,
   which is neither a known Antarctic species nor a typical lichen
   photobiont. Another dominant chloroplast phylotype belonged to the
   atypical Antarctic green algae family. Cyanobacterial phylotypes were
   dominated by those affiliated with the Microcoleus species rather than
   the well-known lichen-associates, Nostoc species. The occurrences of
   these Microcoleus-affiliated cyanobacterial phylotypes were specifically
   abundant within the Yukidori Valley site, one of the Antarctic Specially
   Protected Areas (ASPA). The ASPA site, along with another 50 km-distant
   site, yielded most of the cryptic diversity in the phylotypes of
   chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, which may contribute to the phenotypic
   variability within the rock tripe lichen photobionts.},

Abstract = {A total of 564 isolates of endophytic fungi were recovered from the
   plants Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis collected from
   Antarctica. The isolates were screened against parasites Leishmania
   amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi and against the human tumour cell
   lines. Of the 313 fungal isolates obtained from D. antarctica and 251
   from C. quitensis, 25 displayed biological activity. Nineteen extracts
   displayed leishmanicidal activity, and six inhibited the growth of at
   least one tumour cell line. These fungi belong to 19 taxa of the genera
   Alternaria, Antarctomyces, Cadophora, Davidiella, Helgardia,
   Herpotrichia, Microdochium, Oculimacula, Phaeosphaeria and one
   unidentified fungus. Extracts of 12 fungal isolates inhibited the
   proliferation of L. amazonesis at a low IC50 of between 0.2 and 12.5 mu
   g ml(-1). The fungus Phaeosphaeria herpotrichoides displayed only
   leishmanicidal activity with an IC50 of 0.2 mu g ml(-1), which is
   equivalent to the inhibitory value of amphotericin B. The extract of
   Microdochium phragmitis displayed specific cytotoxic activity against
   the UACC-62 cell line with an IC50 value of 12.5 mu g ml(-1). Our
   results indicate that the unique angiosperms living in Antarctica
   shelter an interesting bioactive fungal community that is able to
   produce antiprotozoal and antitumoral molecules. These molecules may be
   used to develop new leishmanicidal and anticancer drugs.},

Abstract = {Here we report the characterization of fungi from 10 accretion ice
   sections (3300-5100 y old) as well as two deep glacial ice sections that
   are close to the bottom of the glacier (1 000 000-2 000 000 y old) from
   the Vostok, Antarctica, 5G ice core. Fungi were characterized by
   fluorescence microscopy Culturing and sequence analyses of ribosomal DNA
   internal transcribed spacers. A total of 270 fungal colonies were
   cultured from the accretion ice of subglacial Lake Vostok and an
   additional 14 from the glacial ice immediately above the accretion ice.
   Mean concentrations were 0-4.42 cells mL(-1) ice meltwater of which
   0-100\% exhibited viability (as determined by fluorescence microscopy).
   Thirty-one unique fungal ribosomal DNA sequences (28 from accretion ice
   and three from glacial ice) were determined and compared to recent taxa.
   The results, plus tests for growth at low temperatures, indicated that
   Lake Vostok contains a mixture of heterotrophic psychrotolerant fungal
   species. This indicates that the lake is not sterile but contains a
   unique ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Soil fungal diversity plays a fundamental role in delivering key
   ecosystem goods and services. This article assesses diversity of
   saprobic soil and litter microfungi, as taxonomical and functional
   components which affect above- and below-ground relationships within
   Alpine and Mediterranean regions of Italy. We highlighted biodiversity
   high spots focusing on four research topics that have been developed
   over time and are currently in progress in Italy. Preliminary
   quantitative data concerning soil microfungi in the Raethian Alps showed
   a strong reduction of Colony Forming Unit (CFU)s with altitude.
   Keratinophilic microfungi in natural and anthropogenic environments were
   widespread among filamentous fungi and 121 species have been isolated in
   Italy since 1960. Heat stimulated microfungi in Mediterranean region
   soils showed high values both in abundance and species density even two
   years after the experimental fire, with Neosartorya spp. playing a
   pivotal role. The diversity of microfungi of Quercus ilex (150 species),
   in the Mediterranean region, higher than that in leaf litter of other
   species, was explained mainly by different forms of growth and the
   phytoclimatic characters of the areas under study.},

Title = {Abundance and Diversity of n-Alkane-Degrading Bacteria in a Forest Soil
   Co-Contaminated with Hydrocarbons and Metals: A Molecular Study on alkB
   Homologous Genes},

Abstract = {Unraveling functional genes related to biodegradation of organic
   compounds has profoundly improved our understanding of biological
   remediation processes, yet the ecology of such genes is only poorly
   understood. We used a culture-independent approach to assess the
   abundance and diversity of bacteria catalyzing the degradation of
   n-alkanes with a chain length between C(5) and C(16) at a forest site
   co-contaminated with mineral oil hydrocarbons and metals for nearly 60
   years. The alkB gene coding for a rubredoxin-dependent alkane
   monooxygenase enzyme involved in the initial activation step of aerobic
   aliphatic hydrocarbon metabolism was used as biomarker. Within the area
   of study, four different zones were evaluated: one highly contaminated,
   two intermediately contaminated, and a noncontaminated zone. Contaminant
   concentrations, hydrocarbon profiles, and soil microbial respiration and
   biomass were studied. Abundance of n-alkane-degrading bacteria was
   quantified via real-time PCR of alkB, whereas genetic diversity was
   examined using molecular fingerprints (T-RFLP) and clone libraries.
   Along the contamination plume, hydrocarbon profiles and increased
   respiration rates suggested on-going natural attenuation at the site.
   Gene copy numbers of alkB were similar in contaminated and control
   areas. However, T-RFLP-based fingerprints suggested lower diversity and
   evenness of the n-alkane-degrading bacterial community in the highly
   contaminated zone compared to the other areas; both diversity and
   evenness were negatively correlated with metal and hydrocarbon
   concentrations. Phylogenetic analysis of alkB denoted a shift of the
   hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community from Gram-positive bacteria in
   the control zone (most similar to Mycobacterium and Nocardia types) to
   Gram-negative genotypes in the contaminated zones (Acinetobacter and
   alkB sequences with little similarity to those of known bacteria). Our
   results underscore a qualitative rather than a quantitative response of
   hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria to the contamination at the molecular
   level.},

Abstract = {Fungi are known to produce a range of extracellular enzymes and other
   secondary metabolites. Investment in extracellular enzyme production may
   be an important element of the survival strategy of these fungi in
   maritime Antarctic soils. This study focuses on fungi that were isolated
   from ornithogenic, undisturbed and human-impacted soils collected from
   the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, during the austral
   summer in February 2007. We (1) describe fungal diversity based on
   molecular approaches, (2) describe the thermal characteristics of the
   fungal isolates, and (3) screen extracellular hydrolase enzyme
   production (amylase and cellulase) by the isolates. Soil samples were
   cultured using the Warcup soil plating technique and incubated at 4 and
   25 degrees C to allow basic thermal classification. In total, 101
   isolates were obtained. All the isolates were screened at culture
   temperatures of 4 and 25 degrees C in order to detect activity of
   extracellular hydrolase enzymes. At 25 degrees C, ornithogenic penguin
   rookery soils recorded the lowest diversity of fungi, with little
   difference in diversity apparent between the other soils examined. At 4
   degrees C, an undisturbed site recorded the lowest and a human-impacted
   site the highest diversity of fungi. The majority of the fungi
   identified in this study were in the mesophilic thermal class. Six
   strains possessed significant activity for amylase and 13 for cellulase
   at 25 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, four strains showed significant amylase
   and 22 significant cellulase activity. The data presented increase our
   understanding of microbial responses to environmental temperature.},

Abstract = {Data are rather lacking on the diversity of microfungi associated with
   exotic plant substrates transported to continental Antarctica. We
   examined the diversity and species composition of microfungi associated
   with withering woody shoots of saplings of Salix spp. (willows)
   transplanted and in ground contact near Syowa Station, East Antarctica
   for more than 40 years. The willow saplings originated from Hokkaido,
   Northern Japan, and were experimentally transplanted in 1967-1968, but
   died within a few years. Dead willow shoots, unbranched and standing on
   bare ground for approximately 50 years, were used for the isolation of
   fungi with the surface disinfection method. A total of 43 isolates were
   retrieved from 32 (78 \%) of the 41 shoots tested. The fungal isolates
   were classified into 18 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs)
   based on the similarity of rDNA ITS sequences at the 97 \% criterion.
   Leotiomycetes was the most common class in terms of the number of
   isolates and MOTUs, followed by Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and
   Eurotiomycetes. Molecular phylogenetic affinities suggested that the
   closest relatives of the MOTUs were saprobic and root-associated fungi.
   The result of the present study suggested that Cadophora luteo-olivacea
   is widespread in soils throughout Antarctica and likely indigenous.},

Abstract = {For the first time, a mycological analysis of outdoor urban environment
   (air, leaves, sealed surfaces) was carried in the cities of subarctic
   (Murmansk) and temperate (Moscow) climatic zones. The chemical
   composition of dust deposited on leaves of dominant tree species was
   taken as an indicator of the air quality. Assessment of the complex
   impact of factors (climate zone, type of substrate, anthropogenic load)
   on the quantitative and qualitative parameters of mycobiome was
   performed. Compared to Moscow, Murmansk was characterized by an
   increased number and concentrations of pollutants in the deposited dust.
   The number of culturable airborne fungi in Murmansk was substantially
   lower than in Moscow. Half of the species belonged to the opportunistic
   in both cities. Most dangerous opportunistic fungi were absent in the
   air of recreational zones but present on leaves surface and in road dust
   in all assessed zones of the cities. Dust chemical composition affected
   the diversity of fungi species. While the relationship of biological
   parameters with concentration of potentially toxic metals was generally
   negative, Cd increased the fraction of opportunistic fungi in road dust.
   The study revealed an importance of substrate in determining the
   sensitivity of outdoor mycobiome to pollution and highlighted its
   biological characteristics sensitive to climate.},

Abstract = {One of the primary current astrobiological goals is to understand the
   limits of microbial resistance to extraterrestrial conditions. Much
   attention is paid to ionizing radiation, since it can prevent the
   preservation and spread of life outside the Earth. The aim of this
   research was to study the impact of accelerated He ions (150 MeV/n, up
   to 1 kGy) as a component of the galactic cosmic rays on the black
   fungusC. antarcticuswhen mixed with Antarctic sandstones-the substratum
   of its natural habitat-and two Martian regolith simulants, which mimics
   two different evolutionary stages of Mars. The high dose of 1 kGy was
   used to assess the effect of dose accumulation in dormant cells within
   minerals, under long-term irradiation estimated on a geological time
   scale. The data obtained suggests that viable Earth-like microorganisms
   can be preserved in the dormant state in the near-surface scenario for
   approximately 322.000 and 110.000 Earth years within Martian regolith
   that mimic early and present Mars environmental conditions,
   respectively. In addition, the results of the study indicate the
   possibility of maintaining traces within regolith, as demonstrated by
   the identification of melanin pigments through UltraViolet-visible
   (UV-vis) spectrophotometric approach.},

Abstract = {We studied the molecular taxonomy and diversity of cultivable rock fungi
   from Antarctic islands. From 50 rock samples, 386 fungal isolates were
   obtained and identified as 33 taxa of 20 genera. The genera
   Cladophialophora, Cladosporium, Cyphellophora, Eichleriella,
   Paracladophialophora, and Penicillium displayed the highest densities.
   Ecological diversity indices showed that the fungalassemblages are
   diverse and rich with low dominance. The genera Cladophialophora,
   Cladosporium, and Penicillium showed a broad distribution from rocks of
   the various islands. One hundred and fifty-nine fungi, grown at 37
   degrees C, were identified as Penicillium chrysogenum, Fusarium sp., and
   Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. One hundred and three fungi displayed
   haemolytic activity, 81 produced proteinase, 9 produced phospholipase,
   and 25 presented dimorphism and a spore diameter <= 4 mu m. The
   Antarctic Peninsula region appears to be under the effects of global
   climate changes, which may expose and accelerate the rock's weathering
   processes, and expose and release cryptic fungi and other microbes,
   especially those with innate pathogenic potential, previously arrested
   in rocks. Consequently, these rocks and their particles may represent a
   vehicle for the dispersal of microbial propagules, including those able
   to spread pathogens, along, across, and out of Antarctica.},

Journal = {ANTARCTIC SCIENCE},

Volume = {31},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Antarctica is one of the most suitable locations for the bioprospecting
   of psychrotrophic fungi, which play a key role in the nutrient cycle and
   organic material mineralization in cold environments. These actions
   mainly take place via the production of several cold-active
   extracellular enzymes. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   diversity of filamentous fungi from King George Island (25 De Mayo
   Island), Antarctica and their ability to produce extracellular
   hydrolytic enzymes at low temperatures. A total of 51 fungal isolates
   were obtained from 31 samples. Twelve genera were identified, with seven
   among the Ascomycota (Cadophora, Helotiales, Monographella, Oidodendron,
   Penicillium, Phialocephala, Phialophora, Phoma and Pseudogymnoascus),
   one Basidiomycota (Irpex) and two Mucoromycota (Mortierella and Mucor).
   Monographella lycopodina and Mucor zonatus, not previously reported in
   Antarctica, were identified. Nine isolates could not be identified to
   genus level and may represent novel species. Most of the studied fungi
   were psychrotrophic (76.5\%). Nevertheless, only five isolates were able
   to grow at 35 degrees C, 15 degrees C being the optimal growth
   temperature for 65\% of the fungal isolates. Results from enzyme
   production at low temperature revealed that the Antarctic environment
   contains metabolically diverse fungi, which represent potential tools
   for biotechnological applications in cold regions.},

Abstract = {During investigation of the mycobiota in the Sea of Okhotsk, three new
   Penicillium species were isolated from subaqueous soils collected in the
   Sakhalin Gulf and in the northeastern part of the Sakhalin shelf, near
   the Piltun Bay. According to Raper and Thom's classification, the newly
   described species P. piltunense, P. ochotense, and P. attenuatum belong
   to subsection Divaricata. Two analyses were performed to reveal the
   phylogenetic relationships of the putative new species with other
   Penicillium species. Phylogenetically, the new species are related to
   the members of the P. canescens group and share some morphological and
   physiological features with them. However, they differ in having a
   larger colony diameter that makes them similar to P. atrovenetum, P.
   coralligerum, and P. antarcticum. A detailed analysis based on ITS,
   combined beta-tubulin and calmodulin datasets, and morphological
   features revealed that the new species formed a distinct group inside
   the P. atrovenetum subclade. Moreover, P. attenuatum differs from the
   other two species macro- and micromorphologically and may represent a
   distinct phylogenetic lineage.},

Journal = {MYCORRHIZA},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},

Abstract = {Fungi with dematiaceous septate hyphae, termed dark septate endophytes
   (DSE), are common in plant roots, particularly in cold-stressed
   habitats, but their effects on their host plants remain obscure. Here,
   we report a study that assessed the effects of six DSE on the growth and
   nutrient balance of Deschampsia antarctica when plants were supplied
   with the same amount of nitrogen in organic (casein hydrolysate) or
   inorganic (ammonium sulphate) form under controlled conditions. After 60
   days, the DSE, that had each been isolated from D. antarctica and which
   analyses of internal transcribed spacer and large subunit regions
   indicated were similar to members of the Helotiales (Oculimacula
   yallundae, Mollisia and Tapesia spp.) and unassigned anamorphic
   ascomycetes, typically had no effect on, or reduced by 33-71\%, shoot
   and root dry weights relative to uninoculated controls when plants had
   been supplied with nitrogen in inorganic form. In contrast, the DSE
   usually enhanced shoot and root dry weights by 51-247\% when plants had
   been supplied with organic nitrogen. In the presence of inorganic
   nitrogen, only sporadic effects of DSE were recorded on shoot and root
   nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations, whereas in the presence of
   organic nitrogen, three to six of the DSE isolates increased shoot and
   root nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Most of the isolates decreased
   the phosphorus concentrations of shoots and roots when plants had been
   supplied with nitrogen in organic form. Our data suggest that DSE are
   able to mineralise peptides and amino acids in the rhizosphere, making
   nitrogen more freely available to roots.},

Abstract = {At present, reforestation has focused on native forests with
   anthropogenic intervention and eroded soils. There is interest in
   producing Nothofagus seedlings which can overcome adverse conditions
   encountered on reforestation sites. It is necessary to find new fungi
   that can be utilized as mycorrhizal inoculants and that enable the
   seedlings to increase their tolerance to adverse conditions. Two
   ectomycorrhizal strains of the fungus Descolea antarctica (D1 and D2)
   were cultured at different temperatures, pH levels and the activities of
   amylases, cellulases, and phosphatases were determined. In greenhouse
   and nursery trials, the growth responses of inoculated Nothofagus
   obliqua seedlings were evaluated. D1 and D2 exhibited the highest growth
   rates at 23 C. Both strains grew at pH levels from 4 to 11. The highest
   enzymatic activities were registered for amylase (57.2 mg glucose/ml {*}
   g of mycelium {*} hr) and acid phosphatases (58.1 mg p-nitrophenol/ml
   {*} g of mycelium {*} hr) at 37 C, and acid phospatases (1.720 mg
   p-nitrophenol/ml {*} g of mycelium {*} hr) and alkaline phosphatases
   (1.360 mg p-nitrophenol/ml {*} g of mycelium {*} hr) at pH 4 and pH 11,
   respectively. We conclude that suitable N. obliqua seedlings for use in
   reforestation were obtained using D2 as inoculant.},

Abstract = {Seedlings of the annual grass Vulpia ciliata ssp. ambigua were grown in
   sterilized sand with a dark septate root fungus, Phialophora
   graminicola, which had been isolated from a natural population of the
   grass. Tiller number and shoot, root and total biomass of seedlings
   grown with P. graminicola were enhanced relative to uninoculated control
   plants in a growth room and a glasshouse experiment. Root length of
   seedlings grown with P. graminicola was significantly increased, but no
   effects of the fungus on root diameter, number of root hairs or specific
   root length were recorded. Root nitrogen content and shoot, root and
   total phosphorus contents of seedlings grown with the fungus were
   enhanced, but shoot nitrogen concentration of these plants was reduced.
   Shoot biomass and specific root length of inoculated plants were
   positively associated with the number of P. graminicola colonies
   reisolated from roots. These data indicate that P. graminicola acts as a
   beneficial associate of V. ciliata ssp. ambigua seedlings under
   controlled conditions.},

Journal = {MARINE GENOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Whole genome sequences of four bacterial strains Dietzia maris SST1,
   Pseudomonas zhaodongensis SST2, Pseudomonas sp. SST3 and Halomonas
   sulfidaeris SST4, recovered from the South Shetland Trench sediment in
   Antarctica were analyzed using Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The
   respective sizes of their genomes (3.88, 4.99, 5.60 and 4.25 Mb) and GC
   contents (70.0, 60.3, 59.9 and 53.8\%) are in agreement with these
   values of other strains of the species. The bacterial strains displayed
   promising antimicrobial activity against a number of pathogenic
   bacterial and fungal species. Whole genomes have been assembled and
   biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been identified using the
   antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) web
   platform. Comparative analysis of the genome sequences revealed that the
   strains host abundant BGCs encoding for terpenes, siderophores,
   arylpolyene, bacteriocins, and lassopeptides. Furthermore, the key
   stress-related genes were identified and their distribution provided an
   insight into how these isolates adapt to key marine environmental
   conditions. This comprehensive study is a contribution to understanding
   the nature of life on the deep-sea environments.},

Abstract = {Research on mycorrhizal symbiosis has been slowed by a lack of
   established study systems. To address this challenge, we have been
   developing Suillus, a widespread ecologically and economically relevant
   fungal genus primarily associated with the plant family Pinaceae, into a
   model system for studying ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations. Over the
   last decade, we have compiled extensive genomic resources, culture
   libraries, a phenotype database, and protocols for manipulating Suillus
   fungi with and without their tree partners. Our efforts have already
   resulted in a large number of publicly available genomes,
   transcriptomes, and respective annotations, as well as advances in our
   understanding of mycorrhizal partner specificity and host communication,
   fungal and plant nutrition, environmental adaptation, soil nutrient
   cycling, interspecific competition, and biological invasions. Here, we
   highlight the most significant recent findings enabled by Suillus,
   present a suite of protocols for working with the genus, and discuss how
   Suillus is emerging as an important model to elucidate the ecology and
   evolution of ECM interactions.},

Title = {Geographical Diversity of Proteomic Responses to Cold Stress in the
   Fungal Genus Pseudogymnoascus},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In understanding stress response mechanisms in fungi, cold stress has
   received less attention than heat stress. However, cold stress has shown
   its importance in various research fields. The following study examined
   the cold stress response of six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolated from
   various biogeographical regions through a proteomic approach. In total,
   2541 proteins were identified with high confidence. Gene Ontology
   enrichment analysis showed diversity in the cold stress response
   pathways for all six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolates, with metabolic and
   translation-related processes being prominent in most isolates. 25.6\%
   of the proteins with an increase in relative abundance were increased by
   more than 3.0-fold. There was no link between the geographical origin of
   the isolates and the cold stress response of Pseudogymnoascus spp.
   However, one Antarctic isolate, sp3, showed a distinctive cold stress
   response profile involving increased flavin/riboflavin biosynthesis and
   methane metabolism. This Antarctic isolate (sp3) was also the only one
   that showed decreased phospholipid metabolism in cold stress conditions.
   This work will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cold
   stress response and adaptation in psychrotolerant soil microfungi, with
   specific attention to the fungal genus Pseudogymnoascus.},

Abstract = {During the evolution organisms are subjected to the continuous impact of
   environmental factors. In recent years an increasing number of studies
   have focused on the physicochemical limits of life on Earth such as
   temperature, pressure, drought, salt content, pH, heavy metals, etc.
   Extreme environmental conditions disrupt the most important interactions
   that support the function and structure of biomolecules. For this
   reason, organisms inhabiting extreme habitats have recently become of
   particularly great interest. Although filamentous fungi are an important
   part of the polar ecosystem, information about their distribution and
   diversity, as well as their adaptation mechanisms, is insufficient. In
   the present study, the fungal strain Penicillium griseofulvum isolated
   from an Antarctic soil sample was used as a study model. The fungal
   cellular response against short term exposure to low temperature was
   observed. Our results clearly showed that short-term low temperature
   exposure caused oxidative stress in fungal cells and resulted in
   enhanced level of oxidative damaged proteins, accumulation of reserve
   carbohydrates and increased activity of the antioxidant enzyme defence.
   Ultrastructural changes in cell morphology were analysed. Different
   pattern of cell pathology provoked by the application of two stress
   temperatures was detected. Overall, this study aimed to observe the
   survival strategy of filamentous fungi in extremely cold habitats, and
   to acquire new knowledge about the relationship between low temperature
   and oxidative stress.},

Abstract = {Endolithic growth within rocks is a critical adaptation of microbes
   living in harsh environments where exposure to extreme temperature,
   radiation, and desiccation limits the predominant life forms, such as in
   the ice-free regions of Continental Antarctica. The microbial diversity
   of the endolithic communities in these areas has been sparsely examined.
   In this work, diversity and composition of bacterial assemblages in the
   cryptoendolithic lichen-dominated communities of Victoria Land
   (Continental Antarctica) were explored using a high-throughput
   metabarcoding approach, targeting the V4 region of 16S rDNA. Rocks were
   collected in 12 different localities (from 14 different sites), along a
   gradient ranging from 1000 to 3300 m a.s.l. and at a sea distance
   ranging from 29 to 96 km. The results indicate Actinobacteria and
   Proteobacteria are the dominant taxa in all samples and defined a `core'
   group of bacterial taxa across all sites. The structure of bacteria
   communities is correlated with the fungal counterpart and among the
   environmental parameters considered, altitude was found to influence
   bacterial biodiversity, while distance from sea had no evident
   influence.},

   widespread in the soil in the survey area, and possible reasons for this
   finding, and their implication for distribution studies are discussed.

Pages = {81-92},
Abstract = {Endoparasitic and predatory nematophagous fungi are widely distributed
   throughout the maritime Antarctic, being recorded along the Antarctic
   Peninsula as far south as 68.degree. S. Fungi were recorded from 71\% of
   the sites examined with Cephalosporium balanoides and Cactylaria
   gracilis being the commonest recorded endoparasite and predator,
   respectively. Endoparasites with adhesive and nematode-attracting
   conidia were more abundant and had a competitive advantage in the
   Antarctic ecosystem over those parasites requiring their conidia to be
   ingested before infection could occur. Predators able to form traps
   spontaneously on germination were far more abundant than those species
   with a more saprophytic mode of existence, with constricting rings being
   the most commonly isolated trapping mechanism. Species capturing
   nematodes by 3-dimensional networks were restricted to bird-associated
   sites indicating that they are able to grow saprophytically in such
   organically enriched material. Nematophagous basidiomycetes and
   phycomycetes were absent except for a single Myzocytium sp. isolated

Abstract = {Wildfires can negatively affect ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities.
   However, potential shifts in community structures due to wildfires have
   rarely been evaluated in the forests of eastern Eurasia, where surface
   fires are frequent. We investigated EM fungal communities in a Larix
   gmelinii-dominated forest that burned in 2003 in Zeya, in the Russian
   Far East. A total of 120 soil samples were collected from burned and
   adjacent unburned forest sites. The EM fungal root tips were morphotyped
   and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were obtained for fungal
   identification. We detected 147 EM fungal operational taxonomic units,
   and EM fungal richness was 25\% lower at the burned site than at the
   unburned site. EM fungal composition was characterized by the occurrence
   of disturbance-adapted fungi (Amphinema and Wilcoxina) at the burned
   site and late-successional fungi (Lactarius, Russula and Cortinarius) at
   the unburned site. These findings suggest that the EM fungal communities
   did not recover to pre-fire levels 16 years after the fire. Suillus
   species were the dominant EM fungi on L. gmelinii, with greater richness
   and frequency at the burned site. Both Larix and Suillus exhibit
   adaptive traits to quickly colonize fire-disturbed habitats. Frequent
   surface fires common to eastern Eurasia are likely to play important
   roles in maintaining Larix forests, concomitantly with their closely
   associated EM fungi.},

Title = {Extracellular hydrolytic enzymes produced by yeasts from Antarctic

Journal = {ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In the Antarctic environment, yeasts are versatile eukaryotes that have
   shown wide dispersion in different substrates, producing active enzymes
   in extreme conditions, but their relevance in biotechnological
   applications is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   the production of extracellular hydrolases by yeasts isolated from
   Antarctic lichens and molecularly identify these isolates. From a total
   of 144 isolates on the screening, 109 (76\%) produced at least one of
   the hydrolases tested, with most activities for proteases 59 (41\%),
   cellulases 58 (40\%), esterases 57 (39\%), lipases 29 (20\%), amylases
   23 (16\%) and pectinases 20 (14\%). Among these isolates, 76 were
   identified, most belonged to the phylum Basidiomycota (n=73) with the
   dominance of Vishniacozyma victoriae (n=27), Cystobasidium alpinum
   (n=3), Mrakia niccombsii (n=3), Cystobasidium laryngis (n=2), Bannozyma
   yamatoana (n=2), Holtermanniella nyarrowii (n=2), and Glaciozyma
   martinii (n=2). This study is the first one reporting extracellular
   enzyme production by yeasts isolated from thallus of the species of
   Antarctic lichens Lecania brialmontii, Polycauliona candelaria, Usnea
   capillacea, Cladonia metacorallifera, and Polycauliona regalis. With
   these data, it's possible to confirm lichens as a source of
   hydrolase-producing yeasts, reinforcing the potential of these
   microorganisms in bioprospecting studies of catalytic molecules from
   polar regions that may be useful in promising biotechnological
   applications.},

Abstract = {Coccomyxa Schmidle (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) is a genus of green
   microalgae that has worldwide distribution, with representatives found
   in a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Members of this
   taxon can be free-living and/or associated with other organisms,
   establishing different types of relationships (e.g. parasitic,
   symbiotic). The most frequent organisms forming associations with
   Coccomyxa are fungi and marine animals, most importantly mussels.
   Moreover, there is a well-documented association between a Coccomyxa
   strain and Gingko biloba and some Coccomyxa-like microalgae have been
   found in the bark of other trees. Here we describe a green algal strain
   found in association with carnivorous plants of the genus Drosera L. The
   systematics of Coccomyxa based only on classical methods is problematic,
   due to the very simple morphology of the genus and its high phenotypic
   plasticity. Therefore, the microalga associated with Drosera plants was
   isolated, maintained in culture and subjected to an integrative taxonomy
   approach, including morphological, ultrastructural and molecular
   analyses, along with ecological considerations. Phylogenetic
   reconstructions based on the rbcL and 18S rRNA genes and molecular data
   obtained from the ITS2 spacer, including both sequence and secondary
   structure analyses, showed that the investigated microorganism belonged
   to a lineage distinct from those sequenced so far. An accurate taxonomic
   comparison between the microalga associated with Drosera and each of the
   species already described for the genus Coccomyxa was also carried out,
   considering morphology, ultrastructure and ecology. The results as a
   whole allowed us to erect a new species inside the genus Coccomyxa:

Abstract = {To explore the diversity and application potential of Antarctic
   microorganisms, 1208 strains bacteria and fungi were isolated from 5
   samples collected from the Fildes Peninsula during China's 27th and 31st
   Antarctic expeditions. By using 16S and ITS sequence similarity
   alignment, 83 strains bacteria belonging to 20 genera and 30 strains
   fungi belonging to 7 genera were identified. Among them, 1 strains
   bacteria and 6 strains fungi showed low sequence similarity to the
   database, suggesting that they might be novel species.
   Physiological-biochemical characteristics showed that the identified
   bacteria could utilize many kinds of carbohydrates and that the
   identified fungi could produce several kinds of extracellular enzymes.
   The fungal strain MS-19, identified asAspergillus sydowii, possesses the
   potential to produce antifungal activity agents based on an
   activity-guided approach. Further isolation yielded four polyketones:
   versicone A (1), versicone B (2), 4-methyl-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one
   (3), and (R)-(+)-sydowic acid (4). It should be noted that1displayed
   strong activity againstCandida albicans, with an MIC value of 3.91 mu

Title = {Diversity and extracellular enzymatic activities of yeasts isolated from
   King George Island, the sub-Antarctic region},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Background: Antarctica has been successfully colonized by microorganisms
   despite presenting adverse conditions for life such as low temperatures,
   high solar radiation, low nutrient availability and dryness. Although
   these ``cold-loving{''} microorganisms are recognized as primarily
   responsible for nutrient and organic matter recycling/mineralization,
   the yeasts, in particular, remain poorly characterized and understood.
   The aim of this work was to study the yeast microbiota in soil and water
   samples collected on King George Island.
   Results: A high number of yeast isolates was obtained from 34 soil and
   14 water samples. Molecular analyses based on rDNA sequences revealed 22
   yeast species belonging to 12 genera, with Mrakia and Cryptococcus
   genera containing the highest species diversity. The species
   Sporidiobolus salmonicolor was by far the most ubiquitous, being
   identified in 24 isolates from 13 different samples. Most of the yeasts
   were psychrotolerant and ranged widely in their ability to assimilate
   carbon sources (consuming from 1 to 27 of the 29 carbon sources tested).
   All species displayed at least 1 of the 8 extracellular enzyme
   activities tested. Lipase, amylase and esterase activity dominated,
   while chitinase and xylanase were less common. Two yeasts identified as
   Leuconeurospora sp. and Dioszegia fristingensis displayed 6 enzyme
   activities.
   Conclusions: A high diversity of yeasts was isolated in this work
   including undescribed species and species not previously isolated from
   the Antarctic region, including Wickerhamomyces anomalus, which has not
   been isolated from cold regions in general. The diversity of
   extracellular enzyme activities, and hence the variety of compounds that
   the yeasts may degrade or transform, suggests an important nutrient
   recycling role of microorganisms in this region. These yeasts are of
   potential use in industrial applications requiring high enzyme
   activities at low temperatures.},

Title = {Symbiotic fungal associations in `lower' land plants},

Year = {2000},
Volume = {355},
Number = {1398},

Abstract = {An analysis of the current state of knowledge of symbiotic fungal
   associations in `lower' plants is provided Three fungal phyla, the
   Zygomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, are involved in forming these
   associations, each producing a distinctive suite of structural features
   in well-defined groups of `lower' plants. Among the `lower' plants only
   mosses and Equisetum appear to lack one or other of these types of
   association. The salient features of the symbioses produced by each
   fungal group are described and the relationships between these
   associations and those formed by the same or related fungi in `higher'
   plants are discussed. Particular consideration is given to the question
   of the extent to which root-fungus associations in `lower' plants are
   analogous to `mycorrhizas' of `higher' plants and the need for analysis
   of the functional attributes of these symbioses is stressed.
   Zygomycetous fungi colonize a wide range of extant lower land plants
   (hornworts, many hepatics, lycopods, Ophioglossales, Psilotales and
   Gleicheniaceae), where they often produce structures analogous to those
   seen in the vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizas of higher plants,
   which are formed by members of the order Glomales. A preponderance of
   associations of this kind is in accordance with palaeobotanical and
   molecular evidence indicating that glomalean fungi produced the
   archetypal symbioses with the first plants to emerge on to land.
   It is shown, probably for the first time, that glomalean fungi forming
   typical VA mycorrhiza with a higher plant (Plantago lanceolata) can
   colonize a thalloid liverwort (Pellia epiphylla), producing arbuscules
   and vesicles in the hepatic. The extent to which these associations,
   which are structurally analogous to mycorrhizas, have similar functions
   remains to be evaluated.
   Ascomycetous associations are found in a relatively small number of
   families of leafy liverworts. The structural features of the fungal
   colonization of rhizoids and underground axes of these plants are
   similar to those seen in mycorrhizal associations of ericaceous plants
   like Vaccinium. Cross inoculation experiments have confirmed that a
   typical mycorrhizal endophyte of ericaceous plants, Hymenoscyphus
   ericae, will form associations in liverworts which are structurally
   identical to those seen in nature. Again, the functional significance of
   these associations remains to be examined.
   Some members of the Jungermanniales and Metzgeriales form associations
   with basidiomycetous fungi. These produce intracellular coils of hyphae,
   which are similar to the pelotons seen in orchid mycorrhizas, which also
   involve basidiomycetes. The fungal associates of the autotrophic Aneura
   and of its heterotrophic relative Cryptothallus mirabilis have been
   isolated. In the latter case it has been shown that the fungal symbiont
   is an ectomycorrhizal associate of Betula, suggesting that the
   apparently obligate nature of the association between the hepatic and
   Betula in nature is based upon requirement for this particular
   heterotroph.},

Abstract = {Mt. Erebus, Antarctica, is the southernmost active volcano in the world
   and harbors diverse geothermally unique ecosystems, including
   ``Subglacial{''} and ``Exposed{''} features, surrounded by a vast desert
   of ice and snow. Previous studies, while limited in scope, have
   highlighted the unique and potentially endemic biota of Mt. Erebus.
   Here, we provide an amplicon-based biodiversity study across all domains
   of life and all types of geothermal features, with physicochemical and
   biological data from 48 samples (39 Exposed and 9 Subglacial) collected
   through various field seasons. We found potentially high taxonomic
   novelty among prokaryotes and fungi, supporting past hypotheses of high
   endemism due to the distinctive and isolated environment; in particular,
   the large number of taxonomically divergent fungal sequences was
   surprising. We found that different site types had unique
   physicochemistry and biota; Exposed sites were warmer than Subglacial
   (median: 40 degrees C versus 10 degrees C for Exposed and Subglacial,
   respectively) and tended to have more photosynthetic organisms (
   Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta). Subglacial sites had more
   Actinobacteriota, correlated with greater concentrations of Ca and Mg
   present. Our results also suggest potential human impacts on these
   remote, highly significant sites, finding evidence for fungal taxa
   normally associated with wood decay. In this study, we provide a
   blueprint for future work aimed at better understanding the novel biota
   of Mt. Erebus.},

Abstract = {The use of yeasts has been explored as an efficient alternative to
   fungicide application in the treatment and prevention of post-harvest
   fruit deterioration. Here, we evaluated the biocontrol abilities of the
   Antarctic yeast strain Debaryomyces hansenii UFT8244 against the
   post-harvest phytopathogenic fungi Botrytis cinerea and Rhizopus
   stolonifer for the protection and preservation of strawberry fruit. The
   strongest inhibition of germination of B. cinerea (57\%) was observed at
   0 degrees C, followed by 40\% at 25 degrees C. In addition, germ tubes
   and hyphae of B . cinerea were strongly surrounded and colonized by D.
   hansenii. . Production of the enzymes beta-1,3-glucanase, chitinase and
   protease by D. hansenii was detected in the presence of phytopathogenic
   fungus cell walls. The activity of beta-1,3-glucanase was highest on day
   12 of incubation and remained high until day 15. Chitinase and protease
   activities reached their highest levels on the day 15 of incubation. D.
   hansenii additionally demonstrated the ability to resist oxidative
   stress. Our data demonstrated that the main biocontrol mechanisms
   displayed by D. hansenii were the control of phytopathogenic fungal
   spore germination, production of antifungal enzymes and resistance to
   oxidative stress. We conclude that isolate D . hansenii UFT8422 should
   be further investigated for use at commercial scales at low
   temperatures.},

Title = {Symbiotic Interaction Enhances the Recovery of Endangered Tree Species
   in the Fragmented Maulino Forest},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Beneficial plant-associated microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes,
   are key partners that normally improve plant survival under different
   environmental stresses. It has been shown that microorganisms from
   extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica
   plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants
   and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N.
   glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a
   narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the
   Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation
   with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic
   host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance
   {[}photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both
   endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal
   endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii
   through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant
   experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the
   model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has
   negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the
   biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of
   transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated
   with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes
   produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca
   photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In
   N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on
   inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this
   species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with
   root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current
   distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal
   endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our
   results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal
   endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the
   survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool
   for the restoration of endangered tree species.},

Title = {Actinobacteria from Antarctica as a source for anticancer discovery},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Although many advances have been achieved to treat aggressive tumours,
   cancer remains a leading cause of death and a public health problem
   worldwide. Among the main approaches for the discovery of new bioactive
   agents, the prospect of microbial secondary metabolites represents an
   effective source for the development of drug leads. In this study, we
   investigated the actinobacterial diversity associated with an endemic
   Antarctic species, Deschampsia antarctica, by integrated
   culture-dependent and culture-independent methods and acknowledged this
   niche as a reservoir of bioactive strains for the production of
   antitumour compounds. The 16S rRNA-based analysis showed the
   predominance of the Actinomycetales order, a well-known group of
   bioactive metabolite producers belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum.
   Cultivation techniques were applied, and 72 psychrotolerant
   Actinobacteria strains belonging to the genera Actinoplanes,
   Arthrobacter, Kribbella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pilimelia,
   Pseudarthrobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptacidiphilus, Streptomyces and
   Tsukamurella were identified. The secondary metabolites were screened,
   and 17 isolates were identified as promising antitumour compound
   producers. However, the bio-guided assay showed a pronounced
   antiproliferative activity for the crude extracts of Streptomyces sp.
   CMAA 1527 and Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1653. The TGI and LC50 values
   revealed the potential of these natural products to control the
   proliferation of breast (MCF-7), glioblastoma (U251), lung/non-small
   (NCI-H460) and kidney (786-0) human cancer cell lines. Cinerubin B and
   actinomycin V were the predominant compounds identified in Streptomyces
   sp. CMAA 1527 and Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1653, respectively. Our results
   suggest that the rhizosphere of D. antarctica represents a prominent
   reservoir of bioactive actinobacteria strains and reveals it as an
   important environment for potential antitumour agents.},

   correlation with deglaciation time},
Journal = {SYMBIOSIS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {79},

Abstract = {Since ice-free areas in Antarctica are predicted to increase by up to
   25\% before the end of this century, lichens such as the genus Placopsis
   will be important colonizers of these newly available grounds and will
   still be present in later successional stages of the lichen community.
   The main symbionts of Placopsis species are examined for 56 specimens
   collected from the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica using molecular
   (fungal and algal nrITS, fungal RPB1, algal rbcL sequences) and
   morphological methods. The specimens were collected from soils with
   different deglaciation times. Eight uni-algal photobiont cultures were
   obtained and analysed from two specimens. Placopsis antarctica and P.
   contortuplicata proved to be monophyletic and are sister species, only
   the former producing vegetative diaspores (soredia). Both share the same
   photobiont pool and are lichenized with two closely related species,
   Stichococcus antarcticus and S. allas. Two haplotypes of S. antarcticus
   are restricted to areas deglaciated for more than 5000 years and the
   volcanic Deception Island indicating a shift in the photobionts of
   Placopsis in the course of the soil and lichen community development.
   These photobiont haplotypes exhibit different ecological preferences,
   possibly leading to adaptation of the symbiotic entity to changing
   environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {Two Gram-variable, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped, endospore-forming
   bacterial strains, M4-2(T) and M4-1, were isolated from soil samples
   collected from Oblast Magadan, Russian Far East, as micro-organisms
   antagonistic to the psychrophilic phytopathogenic fungus Typhula
   ishikariensis. Strains M4-2(T) and M4-1 were identified as members of
   the genus Paenibacillus by phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses based on
   16S rRNA gene sequences. The strains contained anteiso-C-15:0 as the
   major fatty acid (63.0-64.7\%) and MK-7 as the major isoprenoid quinone.
   The DNA G+C contents were 42.8 and 41.7 mol\%, respectively. 16S rRNA
   gene sequence analysis showed that strains M4-2(T) and M4-1 exhibited
   high similarities with Paenibacillus macquariensis DSM 2(T) (99.5 and
   99.7\%, respectively) and Paenibacillus antarcticus LMG 22078(T) (99.4
   and 99.5\%, respectively). There were no clear differences in the
   phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data
   between the novel isolates and P. macquariensis DSM 2(T). DNA-DNA
   hybridization experiments between strain M4-2(T) and P. macquariensis
   DSM 2(T) and P. antarcticus LMG 22078(T) revealed reassociation values
   of 56 and 49\%, respectively. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed the
   differences between the new isolates and reference strains that were
   observed with the DNA-DNA hybridization studies. On the basis of the
   results described above, it is proposed that the isolates represent a
   novel subspecies of P. macquariensis, Paenibacillus macquariensis subsp.
   defensor subsp. nov. The type strain is M4-2(T) (=JCM 14954(T)=NCIMB
   14397(T)).},

Abstract = {We describe the application of molecular biological techniques to
   estimate eukaryotic diversity (primarily fungi, algae, and protists) in
   Antarctic soils across a latitudinal and environmental gradient between
   approximately 60 and 87degreesS. The data were used to (i) test the
   hypothesis that diversity would decrease with increasing southerly
   latitude and environmental severity, as is generally claimed for
   ``higher{''} faunal and plant groups, and (ii) investigate the level of
   endemicity displayed in different taxonomic groups. Only limited support
   was obtained for a systematic decrease in diversity with latitude, and
   then only at the level of a gross comparison between maritime (Antarctic
   Peninsula/Scotia Arc) and continental Antarctic sites. While the most
   southerly continental Antarctic site was three to four times less
   diverse than all maritime sites, there was no evidence for a trend of
   decreasing diversity across the entire range of the maritime Antarctic
   (60 to 72degreesS). Rather, we found the reverse pattern, with highest
   diversity at sites on Alexander Island (ca. 72degreesS), at the southern
   limit of the maritime Antarctic. The very limited overlap found between
   the eukaryotic biota of the different study sites, combined with their
   generally low relatedness to existing sequence databases, indicates a
   high level of Antarctic site isolation and possibly endemicity, a
   pattern not consistent with similar studies on other continents.},

Title = {NEMATOPHAGOUS FUNGI FROM THE MARITIME ANTARCTIC - FACTORS AFFECTING
   DISTRIBUTION},
Journal = {MYCOPATHOLOGIA},
Year = {1985},
Volume = {90},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-176},
Abstract = {Soil collected from throughout the maritime antarctic was analyzed to
   determine the effects of a range of abiotic and biotic soil parameters
   on the distribution of nematophagous fungi. Endoparasites were far more
   abundant than predatory fungi due to the greater efficiency of
   endoparasites in attracting and infecting nematodes, which resulted in a
   rapid completion of the infection cycle. This allowed endoparasites to
   colonize even the most exposed soil habitats where conditions favorable
   for  nematode activity were restricted to only a few hours daily.
   Seventy-six percent of all endoparasites isolated formed adhesive
   conidia. The success of this group of endoparasites was due to the
   ability of the conidia to attract nematodes. Spontaneous trap forming
   predators were far more abundant than nonspontaneous trap formers. The
   former have a clear competitive advantage over the latter, as they are
   able to attract nematodes to the conidia which subsequently germinate
   and form traps only  when induced by direct chemical stimulation of
   nematodes. These predators are able to use internal reserves only and so
   rapidly respond to short periods when the soil is unfrozen and the
   nematodes are active. Although nematodes were utilized by all the
   species isolated, many were also capable of using Protozoa and Rotifera
   as a food source. While endoparasites were capable of infecting
   Rotifera, they were never observed infecting, or were isolated from soil
   containing, Protozoa. The  distribution of endoparasites and spontaneous
   trap forming predators was largely independent of abiotic soil
   parameters. They were, however, significantly associated with the
   presence and abundance of suitable prey. These species survive solely on
   nematodes and therefore do not require prolonged periods of suitable
   soil conditions in order to produce vegetative mycelium to adsorb
   nutrients saprophytically from the soil, which is a significant
   ecological advantage over the other groups of  microfungi found in the
   Antarctic.},

Abstract = {Located 1140 km from the South American coastline in the South Atlantic
   Ocean and with an age of 4 million years, Trindade Island is the most
   recent volcanic component of Brazilian territory. Its original native
   vegetation has been severely damaged by human influence, in particular
   through the introduction of exotic grazing animals such as goats.
   However, since the complete eradication of goats and other feral animals
   in the late 1990s, the island's vegetation has been recovering, and even
   some endemic species that had been considered extinct have been
   rediscovered. In this study, we set out to characterize the contemporary
   cryptic diversity in soils of the recovering native forest of Trindade
   Island using metabarcoding by high throughput sequencing (HTS). The
   sequence diversity obtained was dominated by microorganisms, including
   three domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) and five kingdoms (Fungi,
   Metazoa, Protozoa, Chromista, and Viridiplantae). Bacteria were
   represented by 20 phyla and 116 taxa, with Archaea by only one taxon.
   Fungi were represented by seven phyla and 250 taxa, Viridiplantae by
   five phyla and six taxa, Protozoa by five phyla and six taxa, Metazoa by
   three phyla and four taxa and Chromista by two phyla and two taxa. Even
   after the considerable anthropogenic impacts and devastation of the
   island's natural forest, our sequence data reveal the presence of a rich
   and complex diversity of microorganisms, invertebrates, and plants and
   provide important baseline biodiversity information that will contribute
   to ecological restoration efforts on the island.},

Abstract = {The development of cold-active biofertilizers and biopesticides could
   help improve sustainable agriculture in mountainous regions. With this
   aim, both psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microorganisms have been
   prospected in cold regions around the world and tested for their
   plant-growth promoting (PGP) effects. Interestingly, very little is
   known about the PGP effects of polar microorganisms in commercial crops.
   This study aimed at isolating cold-active plant-growth promoting
   Pseudomonas spp. from Antarctic soils and testing their PGP effects,
   both in vitro and on wheat (Triticum aestivum). Twenty-five Pseudomonas
   spp. strains isolated from Antarctic soils at Greenwich Island (South
   Shetland Islands, Antarctic Peninsula) were tested. The isolates grew
   well at temperatures ranging from 4 to 30 A degrees C and were therefore
   considered as eury-psychrophiles. The isolates solubilized tri-calcium
   phosphate at 8 and 16 A degrees C in the presence of different sugars as
   sole carbon sources. Besides producing indole-acetic acid, siderophores
   and hydrogen cyanide, several isolates inhibited growth of three plant
   pathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium ultimum and Phytophtora
   infestans) by means of both soluble- and volatile-secondary metabolites.
   Bacterization of T. aestivum seeds with selected isolates significantly
   enhanced root elongation. Moreover, when grown in sterile soil and in a
   temperature-controlled growth chamber at 14 +/- 1 A degrees C,
   inoculated T. aestivum seedlings showed a significant increase in their
   root- and shoot-lengths compared to untreated controls. Overall, the
   results suggest that some of these Antarctic Pseudomonas spp. isolates
   could act as cold-active biofertilizers.},

Title = {The 2024 Outline of Fungi and fungus-like taxa},
Journal = {MYCOSPHERE},

Abstract = {With the simultaneous growth in interest from the mycological community
   to discover fungal species and classify them, there is also an important
   need to assemble all taxonomic information onto common platforms. Fungal
   classification is facing a rapidly evolving landscape and organizing
   genera into an appropriate taxonomic hierarchy is central to better
   structure a unified classification scheme and avoid incorrect taxonomic
   inferences. With this in mind, the Outlines of Fungi and fungus-like
   taxa (2020, 2022) were published as an open-source taxonomic scheme to
   assist mycologists to better understand the taxonomic position of
   species within the Fungal Kingdom as well as to improve the accuracy and
   consistency of our taxonomic language. In this paper, the third
   contribution to the series of Outline of Fungi and fungus-like taxa
   prepared by the Global Consortium for the Classification of Fungi and
   fungus-like taxa is published. The former is updated considering our
   previous reviews and the taxonomic changes based on recent taxonomic
   work. In addition, it is more comprehensive and derives more input and
   consensus from a larger number of mycologists worldwide. Apart from
   listing the position of a particular genus in a taxonomic level, nearly
   1000 notes are provided for newly established genera and higher taxa
   introduced since 2022. The notes section emphasizes on recent findings
   with corresponding references, discusses background information to
   support the current taxonomic status and some controversial taxonomic
   issues are also highlighted. To elicit maximum taxonomic information,
   notes/taxa are linked to recognized databases such as Index Fungorum,
   Faces of Fungi, MycoBank and GenBank, Species Fungorum and others. A new
   feature includes links to Fungalpedia, offering notes in the Compendium
   of Fungi and fungus-like Organisms. When specific notes are not
   provided, links are available to webpages and relevant publications for
   genera or higher taxa to ease data accessibility. Following the recent
   synonymization of Caulochytriomycota under Chytridiomycota, with
   Caulochytriomycetes now classified as a class within the latter, based
   on formally described and currently accepted data, the Fungi comprises
   19 Phyla, 83 classes, 1,220 families, 10,685 genera and ca 140,000
   species. Of the genera, 39.5\% are monotypic and this begs the question
   whether mycologists split genera unnecessarily or are we going to find
   other species in these genera as more parts of the world are surveyed?
   They are 433 speciose genera with more than 50 species. The document
   also highlights discussion of some important topics including number of
   genera categorized as incertae sedis status in higher level fungal
   classification. The number of species at the higher taxonomic level has
   always been a contentious issue especially when mycologists consider
   either a lumping or a splitting approach and herein we provide figures.
   Herein a summary of updates in the outline of Basidiomycota is provided
   with discussion on whether there are too many genera of Boletales,
   Ceratobasidiaceae, and speciose genera such as Colletotrichum. Specific
   case studies deal with Cortinarius, early diverging fungi,
   Glomeromycota, a diverse early divergent lineage of symbiotic fungi,
   Eurotiomycetes, marine fungi, Myxomycetes, Phyllosticta,
   Hymenochaetaceae and Polyporaceae and the longstanding practice of
   misapplying intercontinental conspecificity.
   The outline will aid to better stabilize fungal taxonomy and serves as a
   necessary tool for mycologists and other scientists interested in the
   classification of the Fungi.},

Title = {Outline of Fungi and fungus-like taxa},
Journal = {MYCOSPHERE},

Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1060-1456},
Abstract = {This article provides an outline of the classification of the kingdom
   Fungi (including fossil fungi. i.e. dispersed spores, mycelia,
   sporophores, mycorrhizas). We treat 19 phyla of fungi. These are
   Aphelidiomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiobolomycota, Basidiomycota,
   Blastocladiomycota, Calcarisporiellomycota, Caulochytriomycota,
   Chytridiomycota, Entomophthoromycota, Entorrhizomycota, Glomeromycota,
   Kickxellomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Mortierellomycota, Mucoromycota,
   Neocallimastigomycota, Olpidiomycota, Rozellomycota and Zoopagomycota.
   The placement of all fungal genera is provided at the class-, order- and
   family-level. The described number of species per genus is also given.
   Notes are provided of taxa for which recent changes or disagreements
   have been presented. Fungus-like taxa that were traditionally treated as
   fungi are also incorporated in this outline (i.e. Eumycetozoa,
   Dictyosteliomycetes, Ceratiomyxomycetes and Myxomycetes). Four new taxa
   are introduced: Amblyosporida ord. nov. Neopereziida ord. nov. and
   Ovavesiculida ord. nov. in Rozellomycota, and Protosporangiaceae fam.
   nov. in Dictyosteliomycetes. Two different classifications (in outline
   section and in discussion) are provided for Glomeromycota and
   Leotiomycetes based on recent studies. The phylogenetic reconstruction
   of a four-gene dataset (18S and 28S rRNA, RPB1, RPB2) of 433 taxa is
   presented, including all currently described orders of fungi.},

Title = {Stable C and N isotope ratios reveal soil food web structure and
   identify the nematode Eudorylaimus antarcticus as an
   omnivore-predator in Taylor Valley, Antarctica},

Abstract = {Soil food webs of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica are simple. These
   include primary trophic levels of mosses, algae, cyanobacteria,
   bacteria, archaea, and fungi, and their protozoan and metazoan consumers
   (including relatively few species of nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers,
   and microarthropods). These biota are patchily distributed across the
   landscape, with greatest faunal biodiversity associated with wet soil.
   Understanding trophic structure is critical to studies of biotic
   interactions and distribution; yet, McMurdo Dry Valley soil food web
   structure has been inferred from limited laboratory culturing and
   microscopic observations. To address this, we measured stable isotope
   natural abundance ratios of C (C-13/C-12) and N (N-15/N-14) for
   different metazoan taxa (using whole body biomass) to determine soil
   food web structure in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Nitrogen isotopes were
   most useful in differentiating trophic levels because they fractionated
   predictably at higher trophic levels. Using N-15/N-14, we found that
   three trophic levels were present in wet soil habitats. While
   cyanobacterial mats were the primary trophic level, the nematode Plectus
   murrayi, tardigrade Acutuncus antarcticus, and rotifers composed a
   secondary trophic level of grazers. Eudorylaimus antarcticus had a
   N-15/N-14 ratio that was 2-4 parts per thousand higher than that of
   grazers, indicating that this species is the sole member of a tertiary
   trophic level. Understanding the trophic positions of soil fauna is
   critical to predictions of current and future species interactions and
   their distributions for the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica.},

   soil-derived fungus, Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis SCSIO 05702. Their
   structures were determined through extensive spectroscopic analysis, CD
   spectra, quantum mechanical calculations, and X-ray single-crystal
   diffraction. Ochraceopones A-D (1-4) are the first examples of
   alpha-pyrone merosesquiterpenoids possessing a linear tetracyclic carbon
   skeleton, which has not been previously described. All the isolated
   compounds were tested for their antiviral, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and

Abstract = {Oil spillage on the moist coastal soils of the Ross Sea region of
   Antarctica can impact on populations of microbial heterotrophs in these
   soils, as determined by viable plate counts and a most probable number
   technique. Elevated numbers of culturable hy hydrocarbon degraders.
   bacteria and fungi were detected in surface and subsurface soils from
   oil-contaminated sites. compared with nearby control sites. Culturable
   yeasts were not detected in soil from coastal control sites, yet reached
   > 10(5) organisms g(-1) dry weight in contaminated soils. The presence
   of hydrocarbons in soils resulted in a shift in the genera of culturable
   filamentous fungi. Chrysosporium dominated control soils, yet
   Phialophora was more abundant in oil-contaminated soils. Hydrocarbon
   degraders are most likely bacteria; however, fungi could play a role in
   degradation of hydrocarbons or their metabolites. Depleted levels of
   nitrate detected in some contaminated soils and decreased pH may be the
   result of growth of hydrocarbon de-graders. Numbers and diversity of
   culturable microbes from Antarctic soil varied depending on whether a
   pristine site or a human-impacted (in this case, by fuel spills) site is
   studied.},

Title = {MICROBIOLOGY OF ORNITHOGENIC SOILS FROM THE WINDMILL ISLANDS, BUDD

Abstract = {A range of measures of microbial biomass were compared for their
   effectiveness and internal consistency in characterizing omithogenic
   soils. Excellent correspondences (r = 0.86-0.94, slope = 0.84-1.12) were
   found between four measures of total biomass (ATP, fluorescein diacetate
   hydrolysis rate, substrate induced respiration rate and algal +
   bacterial biomass) when they were compared using regression analysis.
   Bacterial numbers, estimated from agar plate counts, were found to be
   highly correlated with microscopy counts and total biomass measurements,
   though the best-fit relationship was curvilinear rather than linear.
   Measurement of the procaryotic and eucaryotic components of the soil
   microbiota by selective antibiotic inhibition was found to be
   unreliable. Other problems were noted when assay units were converted
   into microbial C using multiplication factors published in the
   literature. The substrate-induced-respiration method overestimated the
   bacterial biomass of occupied penguin colony soil by at least 4-fold
   when the standard conversion factor (1 mg C = 25 mul CO2 h-1) was used.
   Total biomass was also overestimated when
   fluorescein-diacetate-hydrolysis rates were converted to microbial C.
   While all four approaches could provide relative measures of the biomass
   of the Antarctic microbiota, it was concluded that they should not be
   employed in isolation but always in parallel when such soils are
   initially analysed.},

Volume = {10},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The linear growth rates of fungal isolates were measured on agar plates
   at temperatures ranging from 4.degree. to 35.degree. C. Fungi tested
   included the major fungal colonizers of leaves and litter of the three
   dominant plant species on subantarctic Macquarie Island, and major
   fungal species associated with plant and soil communities near
   Australia''s Casey Station on the Antarctic Continent. All fungi grew at
   4.degree. C and were classified as psychrotrophs. Maximum growth rates
   were recorded at temperatures of 10.degree. to 20.degree. C for 13 of
   the 15 isolates from Macquarie Island and for all six isolates from
   Casey. Most of the leaf colonizing fungi from Macquarie Island had
   optimum growth temperatures of 15.degree. C whereas all litter fungi
   from Macquarie Island and Casey fungi except Thelebolus microsporus had
   optimum growth temperatures of 20.degree. C or above. Maximum growth of
   all species was at temperatures above those normally prevailing in their
   natural enviroments, with most species growing at 4.degree. C at between
   10\% and 30\% of their maximum rates. However, microclimatic effects
   have resulted at times in temperatures near their growth optima. The
   highest growth rates at 4.degree. C were recorded for Phoma spp. 1 and
   2, Phoma exigua and Mortierella gamsii from Macquarie Island and
   Mortierella sp. 1 from Casey. Thelebolus microsporus and sterile sp. G
   from Casey also grew relatively fast at 4.degree.C, and these species,
   and Phoma sp. 3 and Phoma exigua from Macquarie Island had the lowest
   Q-10 values for the temperature range 4.degree. to 15.degree. C.},

Abstract = {Aims Citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri)
   is a disease of economic importance. Control of this disease includes
   the use of metallic copper, which is harmful to the environment and
   human health. Previous studies showed that the crude extract from the
   fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. LAMAI 2784 isolated from Antarctic soil had
   in vitro antibacterial action against X. citri. The aim of the present
   study was to expand the applications of this extract.Methods and results
   In greenhouse assays, the crude extract was able to reduce bacterial
   infection on citrus leaves from 1.55 lesions/cm2 (untreated plants) to
   0.04 lesions/cm2. Bisdechlorogeodin was identified as the main compound
   of the bioactive fraction produced by Pseudogymnoascus sp. LAMAI 2784,
   which inhibited bacterial growth in vitro (IC90 approximate to 156 mu g
   ml-1) and permeated 80\% of X. citri cells, indicating that the membrane
   is the primary target.Conclusion The present results showed that the
   bioactive fraction of the extract is mainly composed of the compound
   bisdechlorogeodin, which is likely responsible for the biological
   activity against X. citri, and the main mechanism of action is the
   targeting of the cell membrane. This study indicates that
   bisdechlorogeodin has valuable potential for the control of X. citri.},

Title = {Extreme environments as sources of fungal endophytes mitigating climate

Abstract = {Societal Impact StatementClimate change is predicted to increase drought
   and soil salinity in Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), posing a
   significant threat to global food security. Genetic modification of
   crops to counteract this threat is expensive and has not met with
   universal support, and alternatives are hence needed to enhance crop
   production in MTEs. Here, fungal endophytes from the Atacama Desert,
   High Andes and Antarctica inoculated onto three crops were found to
   alleviate the negative effects of drought and salinity on plant
   performance. The study concludes that extremophile endophytes might be
   used to enhance crop performance as the climate of MTEs changes over
   future decades.SummaryClimate change will curtail the ability to provide
   sufficient food for our rapidly expanding population. Improvements to
   crop production in changing environments, particularly
   Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), which are increasingly subjected
   to drought and salinisation, are hence urgently needed. Here, we
   explored the possibility that fungal endophytes from extreme
   environments can be used to enhance crop yield, survival and tolerance
   to environmental stresses.Plants of lettuce, tomato and bell pepper were
   inoculated with up to six species of endophytic fungi isolated from the
   Atacama Desert, the High Andes and Antarctica. They were then exposed in
   the field for up to 120 days in each of three summers to current
   climatic conditions or to a future climate scenario simulating increased
   drought and soil salinisation.Compared with uninoculated plants, the
   yield and survival of inoculated crops were increased by up to two-fold
   under the future climate scenario. These effects were in part
   attributable to the improved water balance of inoculated crops exposed
   to drought and salinisation. The inocula also increased the
   concentrations of total phenols and proline in leaves and decreased
   lipid peroxidation when plants were subjected to increased aridity and
   salinity. A mixed inoculum of six endophytes from the extreme
   environments conferred the most beneficial effects on crop performance,
   with a commercially available inoculum having fewer positive effects on
   crops.We conclude that the inoculation of crops with endophytes from
   extreme environments may be a viable solution to sustaining crop
   production in MTEs exposed to rapid climate change.

Title = {Polyphenolic substrates and dyes degradation by yeasts from 25 de

Volume = {30},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Antarctica offers a range of extreme climatic conditions, such as low
   temperatures, high solar radiation and low nutrient availability, and
   constitutes one of the harshest environments on Earth. Despite that, it
   has been successfully colonized by `cold-loving' fungi, which play a key
   role in decomposition cycles in cold ecosystems. However, knowledge
   about the ecological role of yeasts in nutrient or organic matter
   recycling/mineralization remains highly fragmentary. The aim of this
   work was to study the yeast microbiota in samples collected on 25 de
   Mayo/King George Island regarding the scope of their ability to degrade
   polyphenolic substrates such as lignin and azo dyes. Sixty-one yeast
   isolates were obtained from 37 samples, including soil, rocks, wood and
   bones. Molecular analyses based on rDNA sequences revealed that 35
   yeasts could be identified at the species level and could be classified
   in the genera Leucosporidiella, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus, Bullera and
   Candida. Cryptococcus victoriae was by far the most ubiquitous species.
   In total, 33\% of the yeast isolates examined showed significant
   activity for dye decolorization, 25\% for laccase activity and 38\% for
   ligninolytic activity. Eleven yeasts did not show positive activity in
   any of the assays performed and no isolates showed positive activity
   across all tested substrates. A high diversity of yeasts were isolated
   in this work, possibly including undescribed species and conspicuous
   Antarctic yeasts, most of them belonging to oligotrophic, slow-growing
   and metabolically diverse basidiomycetous genera. Copyright (c) 2013

Title = {Inactivation of bacterial quorum sensing signals N-acyl

Abstract = {The inactivation of quorum sensing signals, a phenomenon known as quorum
   quenching, has been described in diverse microorganisms, though it
   remains almost unexplored in yeasts. Beyond the well-known properties of
   these microorganisms for the industry or as eukaryotic models, the role
   of yeasts in soil or in the inner tissues of a plant is largely unknown.
   In this report, the wider survey of quorum quenching activities in
   yeasts isolated from Antarctic soil and the inner tissues of sugarcane,
   a tropical crop, is presented. Results show that, independently of their
   niche, quorum quenching activities are broadly present in unicellular
   fungi. Although yeasts showing a broad range of quorum quenching
   activity are present in the two niches, at the same time specific AHL
   inactivation profiles can also be found. Furthermore, yeasts from both
   sampling sites show quorum quenching activities compatible with
   lactonase-like and acylase-like inactivations of AHLs. Interestingly,
   the characterization of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa 7Apo1 showed that the
   presence of a particular AHL does not interfere with the quenching of a
   second molecule. Evidence suggests that yeasts could play a role in the
   modulation of the quorum sensing activity of bacteria. The relationship
   among phylogeny, sampling sites and yeast quorum quenching activities of
   the isolates is analyzed. (C) 2017 British Mycological Society.

Abstract = {A comparative study of the bacteria occurring in soils of montane
   grasslands, montane forests, subalpine forests and alpine tundra
   habitats was conducted to ascertain the types of bacterial metabolic or
   enzymatic activities in the soils of these ecosystems. Elevation
   substantially affected taxa isolated. Amylolytic, cellulolytic and
   pectinolytic activity was observed in cultured isolates from all areas.
   Proteolytic activity was not observed in isolates from alpine tundra but
   was observed in cultures isoalted from all other areas. Microbial
   population sizes remained constant with increased elevation but
   organismic diversity decreased. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria
   were isolated from all ecosystems studied. Free-living N-fixing
   organisms were isolated in large numbers from all areas except the
   alpine tundra. Rapid degradation of cellulose seems to be the result of
   a cooperative effect between bacteria and fungi in alpine tundra soils.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the relationships and thus the classification of fungi, has
   developed rapidly with increasingly widespread use of molecular
   techniques, over the past 10-15 years, and continues to accelerate.
   Several genera have been found to be polyphyletic, and their generic
   concepts have subsequently been emended. New names have thus been
   introduced for species which are phylogenetically distinct from the type
   species of particular genera. The ending of the separate naming of
   morphs of the same species in 2011, has also caused changes in fungal
   generic names. In order to facilitate access to all important changes,
   it was desirable to compile these in a single document. The present
   article provides a list of generic names of Ascomycota (approximately
   6500 accepted names published to the end of 2016), including those which
   are lichen-forming. Notes and summaries of the changes since the last
   edition of `Ainsworth \& Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi' in 2008 are
   provided. The notes include the number of accepted species,
   classification, type species (with location of the type material),
   culture availability, life-styles, distribution, and selected
   publications that have appeared since 2008. This work is intended to
   provide the foundation for updating the ascomycete component of the
   ``Without prejudice list of generic names of Fungi'' published in 2013,
   which will be developed into a list of protected generic names. This
   will be subjected to the XIXth International Botanical Congress in
   Shenzhen in July 2017 agreeing to a modification in the rules relating
   to protected lists, and scrutiny by procedures determined by the
   Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (NCF). The previously invalidly
   published generic names Barriopsis, Collophora (as Collophorina),
   Cryomyces, Dematiopleospora, Heterospora (as Heterosporicola),
   Lithophila, Palmomyces (as Palmaria) and Saxomyces are validated, as are
   two previously invalid family names, Bartaliniaceae and
   Wiesneriomycetaceae. Four species of Lalaria, which were invalidly
   published are transferred to Taphrina and validated as new combinations.
   Catenomycopsis Tibell \& Constant. is reduced under Chaenothecopsis
   Vain., while Dichomera Cooke is reduced under Botryosphaeria Ces. \& De
   Not. (Art. 59).},

Abstract = {In cold environments, biodegradation of organic pollutants and heavy
   metal bio-conversion requires the activity of cold-adapted or
   cold-tolerant microorganisms. In this work, the ability to utilize
   phenol, methanol and n-hexadecane as C source, the tolerance to
   different heavy metals and growth from 5 to 30 degrees C were evaluated
   in cold-adapted yeasts isolated from Antarctica. Fifty-nine percent of
   the yeasts were classified as psychrotolerant as they could grow in all
   the range of temperature tested, while the other 41\% were classified as
   psychrophilic as they only grew below 25 degrees C. In the assimilation
   tests, 32, 78, and 13\% of the yeasts could utilize phenol,
   n-hexadecane, and methanol as C source, respectively, but only 6\% could
   assimilate the three C sources evaluated. In relation to heavy metals
   ions, 55, 68, and 80\% were tolerant to 1 mM of Cr(VI), Cd(II), and
   Cu(II), respectively. Approximately a half of the isolates tolerated all
   of them. Most of the selected yeasts belong to genera previously
   reported as common for Antarctic soils, but several other genera were
   also isolated, which contribute to the knowledge of this cold
   environment mycodiversity. The tolerance to heavy metals of the
   phenol-degrading cold-adapted yeasts illustrated that the strains could
   be valuable as inoculant for cold wastewater treatment in extremely cold
   environments.},

Abstract = {As belonging to one of the most isolated continents on our planet, the
   microbial composition of different environments in Antarctica could hold
   a plethora of undiscovered species with the potential for
   biotechnological applications. This manuscript delineates our
   discoveries after an expedition to the Bulgarian Antarctic Base ``St.
   Kliment Ohridski{''} situated on Livingston Island, Antarctica.
   Amplicon-based metagenomics targeting the 16S rRNA genes and ITS2 region
   were employed to assess the metagenomes of the bacterial, fungal, and
   archaeal communities across diverse sites within and proximal to the
   research station. The predominant bacterial assemblages identified
   included Oxyphotobacteria, Bacteroidia, Gammaprotobacteria, and
   Alphaprotobacteria. A substantial proportion of cyanobacteria reads were
   attributed to a singular uncultured taxon within the family
   Leptolyngbyaceae. The bacterial profile of a lagoon near the base
   exhibited indications of penguin activity, characterized by a higher
   abundance of Clostridia, similar to lithotelm samples from Hannah Pt.
   Although most fungal reads in the samples could not be identified at the
   species level, noteworthy genera, namely Betamyces and Tetracladium,
   were identified. Archaeal abundance was negligible, with prevalent
   groups including Woesearchaeales, Nitrosarchaeum, Candidatus
   Nitrosopumilus, and Marine Group II.},

   sequestration},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Climatic change is pointed as one of the major challenges for global
   food security. Based on current models of climate change, reduction in
   precipitations and in turn, increase in the soil salinity will be a
   sharp constraint for crops productivity worldwide. In this context, root
   fungi appear as a new strategy to improve plant ecophysiological
   performance and crop yield under abiotic stress. In this study, we
   evaluated the impact of the two fungal endophytes Penicillium
   brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum isolated from Antarctic plants on
   nutrients and Na+ contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency,
   yield and survival in tomato and lettuce, facing salinity stress
   conditions. Inoculation of plant roots with fungal endophytes resulted
   in greater fresh and dry biomass production, and an enhanced survival
   rate under salt conditions. Inoculation of plants with the fungal
   endophytes was related with a higher up/down-regulation of ion
   homeostasis by enhanced expression of the NHX1 gene. The two endophytes
   diminished the effects of salt stress in tomato and lettuce, provoked a
   higher efficiency in photosynthetic energy production and an improved
   sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles is suggested by the upregulating of the
   expression of vacuolar NHX1 Na+/H+ antiporters. Promoting
   plant-beneficial interactions with root symbionts appears to be an
   environmentally friendly strategy to mitigate the impact of climate
   change variables on crop production.},

Title = {Metal(loid)-resistant bacterial consortia with antimycotic properties
   increase tolerance of Chenopodium quinoa Wild. to
   metal(loid) stress},
Journal = {RHIZOSPHERE},

Abstract = {Bacteria associated with plants colonizing extreme environments in Chile
   (Atacama and Antarctic Desert soils) provide a model to study plant
   growth-promoting mechanisms that can be useful to improve the growth of
   crops such as Chenopodium quinoa Wild. (Amaranthaceae) growing under
   severe environmental conditions. This study aimed to determine the
   tolerance of extremophile rhizobacteria to multiple metal(loid)s and
   evaluate the effects of formulated consortia in seed germination and
   growth-promotion of C. quinoa. In our work, five rhizobacteria were
   isolated and classified into the bacteria genera Streptomyces, Bacillus,
   and Pseudomonas. The five bacteria showed optimum growth at 26 degrees
   C, pH 6, and 1\% NaCl. In addition, the isolated were resistant to
   arsenic, manganese, zinc, copper, chromium and showed plant
   growth-promoting traits, including indole acetic acid production,
   siderophores production, phosphate solubilization, ACC deaminase
   activity, and ammonia production. According to compatibility tests,
   three bacterial consortia were formulated: i) consortium A (Pseudomonas
   sp. and Bacillus sp. (T1B41)); ii) consortium B (Pseudomonas sp. and
   Bacillus sp. (B2B24)); and iii) consortium C (Streptomyces sp., Bacillus
   sp. (B2B24) and Bacillus sp. (T3B45)). In vitro antagonism against
   phytopathogenic fungi showed that Bacillus sp. (B2B24) and Bacillus sp.
   (T3B45) have a significant level of antagonism (up to 18.7 and 6.8\%,
   respectively) and consortia were the most effective against B. cinerea
   (up to 100\%). Consortia B and C significantly improved the germination
   rate (\%) of C. quinoa seeds (86 +/- 3.3 and 77 +/- 1.7, respectively)
   and the number of leaves, wet stem weight, length stem length, wet root
   weight, and root diameter in the presence of metal(loid)s. Our results
   showed that rhizobacterial consortia based on extremophile
   microorganisms can enhance the growth of C. quinoa seedlings under
   metal(loid) stress, demonstrating beneficial characteristics that may be
   key in the early stages of development.},

Title = {Laboratory scale bioreactor studies on the production of L-asparaginase
   using Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 and Trichosporon
   asahii IBBLA1},
Journal = {BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {L-asparaginase (L-asparagine aminohydrolase, E.C. 3.5.1.1, ASNase) is an
   enzyme that is used primarily for the production of anti-neoplastic to
   treat Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Current formulations of the
   enzyme are highly bacterial in nature which have resulted in adverse
   reactions. The current paper focusses on production of glutaminase and
   urease free ASNase in a laboratory scale bioreactor using two fungal
   species and their efficiency in the scaling up process. The isolated
   species are Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 and Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1
   isolated from wheat bran and Antarctic moss respectively. The
   experiments were conducted under different conditions known as initial,
   optimized and immobilized. Enzyme activity at these conditions for
   Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 were found to be 10.85, 13.56, 17.18 U
   mL(-1) respectively and for Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1 were found to be
   13.97, 19.53, 21.98 U mL(-1) respectively in laboratory scale. The
   consistency of the scale-up data from the shake flask level to the
   laboratory scale level was found to be greater than 90\% efficiency. It
   was also observed that aeration condition had an impact on the enzyme
   production with maximum enzyme activity of 13.48 U mL(-1) for the
   Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 and 19.95 U mL(-1) for Trichosporon asahii
   IBBLA1 being reported at an aeration rate of 1 Lpm. The above results
   proved that laboratory scale production of ASNase has shown consistency
   and efficiency with respect to the flask-scale studies.},

   degrees C, consisting of 42 strains from Antarctic soil and 14 strains
   isolated from Alpine Glacier, were isolated and grouped together based
   on similar morphological and physiological characteristics. Sequences of
   the D1/D2 and ITS regions of the ribosomal DNA confirmed the previous
   analyses and demonstrated that the strains belong to unknown species.
   Three new species are proposed: Mrakia robertii sp. nov. (type strain
   CBS 8912), Mrakia blollopis sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8921) and a
   related anamorphic species Mrakiella niccombsii sp. nov. (type strain
   CBS 8917). Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region revealed that the new
   proposed species were closely related to each other within the Mrakia
   clade in the order Cystofilobasidiales, class Tremellomycetes. The
   Mrakia clade now contains 8 sub-clades. Teliospores were observed in all
   strains except CBS 8918 and for the Mrakiella niccombsii strains.},

Title = {A rhamnolipid biosurfactant increased bacterial population size but
   hindered hydrocarbon biodegradation in weathered contaminated soils},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {778},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Surfactants are used to enhance the bioavailability of recalcitrant
   residual petroleum contamination during bioremediation. However,
   surfactants in some cases inhibit biodegradation, which is often
   attributed to their toxicity. Herein, we showthat a rhamnolipid
   biosurfactant likely served as a carbon source and exhibited
   physiological inhibition on petroleum biodegradation. The addition of
   biosurfactants in mixed, batch, slurry bioreactors with soils from a
   petroleum-contaminated site led to a dose-dependent shift in the
   microbial community with a decrease in diversity and increase in
   population size and delayed biodegradation. Microbial community analysis
   indicated the enrichment of Alphaproteobacteria affiliated taxa such as
   Sphingomonadaceae in systems amended with biosurfactant. The
   diversitywas significantly lower in systemswith higher doses of
   biosurfactants compared to systems without biosurfactant. Droplet
   Digital PCR indicated a 30-90 fold increase in 16S rRNA copy numbers in
   systemswith higher doses of biosurfactant than control systemswithout
   surfactant and nutrients, whereas the nutrient amendment alone led to a
   two-fold increase in population size. Total petroleum hydrocarbon
   analysis showed that the biodegradation extent was negatively impacted
   by rhamnolipid at the highest dose compared to lower doses (23\% vs.
   40\%) or without the biosurfactant. Indigenous isolates cultivated from
   the oil-amended soil exhibited growth on rhamnolipid as a sole carbon
   source. A novel insight gained is how dose-dependent responses of
   microbial communities to biosurfactants alter the biodegradation time
   profile of hydrocarbons. The study highlights the significance
   ofmicrobial assessment prior to surfactant-mediated bioremediation
   practices. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Wood Ash Induced pH Changes Strongly Affect Soil Bacterial Numbers and
   Community Composition},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Recirculation of wood ash from energy production to forest soil improves
   the sustainability of this energy production form as recycled wood ash
   contains nutrients that otherwise would be lost at harvest. In addition,
   wood-ash is beneficial to many soils due to its inherent
   acid-neutralizing capabilities. However, wood ash has several
   ecosystem-perturbing effects like increased soil pH and pore water
   electrical conductivity both known to strongly impact soil bacterial
   numbers and community composition. Studies investigating soil bacterial
   community responses to wood ash application remain sparse and the
   available results are ambiguous and remain at a general taxonomic level.
   Here we investigate the response of bacterial communities in a spruce
   forest soil to wood ash addition corresponding to 0, 5, 22, and 167 t
   wood ash ha(-1). We used culture-based enumerations of general bacteria,
   Pseudomonas and sporeforming bacteria combined with 16S rRNA gene
   amplicon sequencing to valuate soil bacterial responses to wood ash
   application. Results showed that wood ash addition strongly increased
   soil pH and electrical conductivity. Soil pH increased from acidic
   through neutral at 22 t ha(-1) to alkaline at 167 t ha(-1). Bacterial
   numbers significantly increased up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha(-1)
   followed by significant decrease at 167 t ha(-1) wood ash. The soil
   bacterial community composition changed after wood ash application with
   copiotrophic bacteria responding positively up to a wood ash dose of 22
   t ha(-1) while the adverse effect was seen for oligotrophic bacteria.
   Marked changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a wood ash
   dose of 167 t ha(-1) with a single alkaliphilic genus dominating.
   Additionally, spore-formers became abundant at an ash dose of 167 t
   ha(-1) whereas this was not the case at lower ash doses. Lastly,
   bacterial richness and diversity strongly decreased with increasing
   amount of wood ash applied. All of the observed bacterial responses can
   be directly explained by the wood ash induced changes in pH, electrical
   conductivity and the addition of wood ash inherent nutrients.},

Abstract = {Microfungi were isolated from soils, mosses, algae and lichens in the
   Windmill Islands region of Antarctica. From a total of 1,228 isolates,
   22 genera were identified. The most frequently isolated fungi from
   mosses were Mycelia sterilia (47\% of total isolates), Phoma spp.
   (18\%), Penicillium spp. (11\%), Chrysosporium spp. (7\%) and Thelebolus
   microsporus (6\%). Mycelia sterilia, Penicillium spp., Mortierella spp.,
   Chrysosporium cf. pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were also
   frequently isolated from algae. Fungal distribution and diversity were
   poor in samples of lichens, compared to samples from mosses and algae.
   The frequency of occurrence of microfungi was most often associated with
   strong biotic influence. There was a marked increase in fungal diversity
   in human-disturbed sites. Twelve taxa were restricted to soils from near
   the Australian Casey Station, suggesting significant introduction of
   fungi into this environment by human activities. Away from the station,
   fungal distribution appeared to be related to substrata and nutrient
   status rather than dispersal opportunities. Suggestions for future
   research and the need for constant monitoring to clarify the role of
   human disturbance on Antarctic fungi are discussed.},

Abstract = {The fungal floras of plant communities and mineral soils were determined
   at locations both close to and away from sites of human activity.
   Petroleum contaiminated soils and discarded wood which occur near
   Stations were also studied, the former for bacterial as well as fungal
   colonization. The fungal floras of uncontaminated natural communities
   comprised relatively few species, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum and
   Thelebolus microsporus being the most common, together with Epicoccum
   nigrum at Mawson. P. herbarum dominated the fungal floras of mosses at
   Mossell Lake but E. nigrum was also common in Mawson mossbeds. G.
   pannorum was widespread and colonized a range of different habitats,
   particularly in the Vestfold Hills. T. microsporus was also widespread
   particularly at sites frequented by birds and seals. Phialophora
   fastigiata was common around the Stations, especially Davis Station, in
   soils including those contaminated with oil and in wood, and is thought
   to have been introduced with softwood packing crates. A greater range of
   taxa including Mortierella, Mucor, Penicillium and Cladosporium spp. was
   recorded from Mawson Station than from other sites, and this was
   attributed to the effects of human activity. Few fungi but a range of
   bacteria were isolated from the petroleum contaminated soils. A high
   percentage of these soils contained bacteria which could utilize
   hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source. Some of these bacteria showed a
   strong degradative potential, namely Flavobacterium spp.,
   Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp. and an isolate from the family
   Enterobacteriaceae. One isolate of Corynebacterium and the
   Enterobacteriaceae isolate were active hydrocarbon degraders at
   1.degree. C. Hormoconis resinae, the imperfect state of Amorphotheca
   resinae was only isolated from oil spill soils and then only from sites
   of recent spills. Geomyces pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were less
   common in oil contaminated soils than in uncontaminated soils.},

Title = {Vegetation changes and plant wax biomarkers from an ombrotrophic bog
   define hydroclimate trends and human-environment interactions during the

Abstract = {Holocene climate records from northern Europe improve our understanding
   of important North Atlantic ocean and atmospheric circulation systems to
   long-term insolation-driven changes, as well as more rapid forcing and
   feedback mechanisms. Here we assess Holocene climate and environmental
   changes in northern Norway based on the analysis of pollen, non-pollen
   palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, and plant wax biomarkers from a high
   latitude ombrotrophic bog. We define the extent and thickness of
   Hollabattjonnen Bog (0.16 km(2)), which is located 10 km north of
   Tromso. Several cores were analyzed, including a 5.16-m core that spans
   the last 9.5 cal ka BP. Vegetation changes from several sites were
   reconstructed and the distribution and hydrogen isotopic composition
   (delta D) ofn-alkanes (C-21-C-33) were analyzed. Our data show several
   distinct climate intervals that primarily indicate changes in bog
   surface moisture. In the early Holocene (c. 9.5-7.7 cal ka BP), wetter
   conditions are defined by the presence of wetland sedges and grasses,
   higher concentrations of mid-chain lengthn-alkanes, and a similarity in
   delta D values among homologs. A dry mid-Holocene (c. 7.7-3.8 cal ka BP)
   is inferred from the presence of a heath shrubland, low peat
   accumulations rates, and significant differences between delta D values
   of mid- and long-chain lengthn-alkanes. The late Holocene (c. 3.8 cal ka
   BP-present) is marked by the onset of wetter conditions, lateral bog
   expansion, and an increase in sedges and grasses. The Hollabattjonnen
   Bog record is also significant because its margins were an important
   location for human settlement. We correlate early Holocene environmental
   conditions with changes in Stone Age structures recently excavated, and
   we identify the occurrence of coprophilous fungi, such
   asSporormiellaandSordaria, likely associated with reindeer grazing
   activity beginning c. 1 cal ka BP. This site therefore provides
   important regional paleoclimate information as well as context for
   evaluating local prehistoric human-environment interactions.},

Abstract = {A November-December 1984 expedition to the Socompa Volcano in the Andes
   (24-degrees-25'S) rediscovered and described six complex autotrophic
   communities on geothermal warmspots near the summit at 5750 to 6060 m.
   These complex communities are unique in terms of their isolation,
   altitude, and biota, and are considered highly fragile. Environmental
   parameters were measured and standardized germination trials were used
   as bioassays of microclimate. Observations were performed on two
   successive ascents at a 7-d interval, with a total of 8 d recorded.
   The communities were composed mainly of mosses and liverworts, but
   included also algae, fungi, and lichens. In all, 36 taxa of bryophytes
   and lichens have been recognized in less than 400 m2 of vegetation. The
   communities formed dense patches of up to 200 m2 on warm soils (22 to
   31-degrees-C at -10 cm depth) around steam vents and at cave entrances
   emitting vapor (9-37-degrees-C). Insects, a bird (Sicalis olivaceus),
   and a rodent (Phyllotis darwini rupestris) were also present. Air
   temperatures during the visit fluctuated between -12.1 and
   +9.0-degrees-C, with a daily mean of -5.5-degrees-C and a relative
   humidity mean of 78\%. Diurnal temperature amplitude near the surface
   outside warmspots was up to 31-degrees-C at +2 cm and 56-degrees-C at 0
   cm. The mean vapor pressure deficit at +60 cm was 1.1 mbar with an
   absolute maximum of 5.5 mbar. Pan-evaporation registered over 3.5 mm
   d-1, but soils were moist below the surface gravel and moist up to the
   surface at warmspots. This characterizes a cold environment with high
   surface temperature amplitudes and moderate to high moisture. Hundreds
   of kilometers separate these patches from any possible source of
   diaspores, at least for most of their components.},

Abstract = {Winter CO, emissions from soil and snow-covered surfaces can represent a
   significant fraction of the annual carbon cycle in cool-temperate
   broad-leaved deciduous forests. The sources of this CO2 production are,
   however, poorly understood. To clarify the role of saprophytic
   microorganisms in the carbon cycle during the winter (December-April),
   mass loss rates of organic substrates (leaf litter and cellulose
   sheets), and microbial activity and fungal biomass in the litter layer
   of a cool-temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest in Japan were
   investigated. The mass loss rate of leaves reached 13\%, which accounted
   for 26\% of the annual mass loss. Microbial respiration in the leaf
   litter, measured in the laboratory. was detected even at -2 degrees C.
   The ergosterol content (an indicator of fungal biomass) of the cellulose
   sheets increased significantly in the snow-covered season. Seven genera
   of fungi including Varicosporium elodeae, Epicoccum purpurascens and
   Cylindrocarpon destructans were isolated from leaf litter collected from
   under snow cover. Microbial respiration during the winter was estimated
   based on the relationships between the amount of leaf litter available,
   the temperature dependency of microbial respiration and the temperature
   in the litter layer. The 2 microorganisms in the litter layer emitted 31
   gCO(2)-C m(-2), which accounts for 38\% of the total CO2 efflux during
   the winter. These results suggest that through soil respiration,
   microorganisms in the litter layer play an important role in the carbon
   cycle during the winter. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article is the 17th in the Fungal Diversity Notes series which
   allows the researchers to publish fungal collections with updated
   reports of fungus-host and fungus-geography. Herein we report 97 taxa
   with four new genera distributed in three phyla (Ascomycota,
   Glomeromycota and Mucoromycota), 11 classes, 38 orders and 62 families
   collected from various regions worldwide. This collection is further
   classified into taxa from 69 genera with four novel genera namely
   Jinshana, Lithophyllospora, Parapolyplosphaeria and Stegonsporiicola.
   Furthermore, 71 new species, 21 new records, one new combination and
   four novel phylogenetic placements are provided. The new species
   comprise Acrocalymma estuarinum, Aggregatorygma isidiatum,
   Alleppeysporonites elsikii, Amphibambusa aquatica, Apiospora
   hongheensis, Arthrobotrys tachengensis, Calonectria potisiana,
   Collariella hongheensis, Colletotrichum squamosae, Corynespora
   chengduensis, Diaporthe beijingensis, Dicellaesporites plicatus,
   Dicellaesporites verrucatus, Dictyoarthrinium endophyticum,
   Distoseptispora chiangraiensis, Dothiora eucalypti, Epicoccum indicum,

   qujingensis, Melomastia aquilariae, Monoporisporites jansoniusii, M.
   pattersonii, Monoporisporites valdiyae, Mucispora maesotensis, Mucor
   soli, Muyocopron yunnanensis, Nigrospora tomentosae, Ocellularia
   psorirregularis, Ophiocordyceps duyunensis, Oxneriaria nigrodisca,
   Oxydothis aquatica, O. filiforme, Phacidiella xishuangbannaensis,
   Phlebiopsis subgriseofuscescens, Pleurothecium takense, Pleurotus
   tuber-regium, Pseudochaetosphaeronema puerensis, Pseudodactylaria
   guttulate, Racheliella chinensis, Rhexoacrodictys fangensis, Roussoella
   neoaquatica, Rubroboletus pruinosus, Sanghuangporus subzonatus,
   Scytalidium assmuthi, Shrungabeeja kudremukhensis, Spirographa skorinae,
   Stanjehughesia bambusicola, Stegonsporiicola aurantiaca, Umbelopsis
   hingganensis, Vararia tenuata, Verruconis pakchongensis, Wongia
   bandungensis, and Zygosporium cymodoceae. The new combination is
   Parapolyplosphaeria thailandica (equivalent to Polyplosphaeria
   thailandica). The 21 new hosts, geographical and habitat records
   comprise Acrocalymma fici, Apiculospora spartii, Aspergillus
   subramanianii, Camposporium ramosum, Clonostachys rogersoniana,
   Colletotrichum brevisporum, C. plurivorum, Collybiopsis gibbosa,
   Dictyosporium tratense, Distoseptispora adscendens, Exosporium
   livistonae, Ganoderma gibbosum, Graphis mikuraensis, Gymnosporangium
   paraphysatum, Lasiodiplodia thailandica, Moesziomyces bullatus,
   Penicillium cremeogriseum, P. echinulonalgiovense, P. javanicum, P.
   lanosocoeruleum, P. polonicum, and Pleurotus tuber-regium. Graphis
   chlorotica, G. panhalensis and G. parilis are given as novel
   phylogenetic placements. In addition, we provide the morphology of
   Tarzetta tibetensis which was missing in the previous Fungal Diversity
   Notes 1611-1716. Identification of characterization of all these taxa
   are supported by morphological and multigene phylogenetic analyses.},

   communities},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {907},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Ice free areas of continental Antarctica are among the coldest and
   driest environments on Earth, and yet, they support surprisingly diverse
   and highly adapted microbial communities. Endolithic growth is one of
   the key adaptations to such extreme environments and often represents
   the dominant life-form. Despite growing scientific interest, little is
   known of the mechanisms that influence the assembly of endolithic
   microbiomes across these harsh environments. Here, we used metagenomics
   to examine the diversity and assembly of endolithic bacterial
   communities across Antarctica within different rock types and over a
   large elevation range. While granite supported richer and more
   heterogeneous communities than sandstone, elevation had no apparent
   effect on taxonomic richness, regardless of rock type. Conversely,
   elevation was clearly associated with turnover in community composition,
   with the deterministic process of variable selection driving microbial
   assembly along the elevation gradient. The turnover associated with
   elevation was modulated by geology, whereby for a given elevation
   difference, turnover was consistently larger between communities
   inhabiting different rock types. Overall, selection imposed by elevation
   and geology appeared stronger than turnover related to other spatially
   structured environmental drivers. Our findings indicate that at the
   cold-arid limit of life on Earth, geology and elevation are key
   determinants of endolithic bacterial heterogeneity. This also suggests
   that warming temperatures may threaten the persistence of such
   extreme-adapted organisms.},

   Lichens-Associated Bacteria},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The diversity of lichen-associated bacteria from lichen taxa Cetraria,
   Cladonia, Megaspora, Pseudephebe, Psoroma, and Sphaerophorus was
   investigated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Physiological
   characteristics of the cultured bacterial isolates were investigated to
   understand possible roles in the lichen ecosystem. Proteobacteria (with
   a relative abundance of 69.7-96.7\%) were mostly represented by the
   order Rhodospirillales. The 117 retrieved isolates were grouped into 35
   phylotypes of the phyla Actinobacteria (27), Bacteroidetes (6),
   Deinococcus-Thermus (1), and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria (53),
   Betaproteobacteria (18), and Gammaproteobacteria (12)). Hydrolysis of
   macromolecules such as skim milk, polymer, and (hypo)xanthine,
   solubilization of inorganic phosphate, production of phytohormone
   indole-3-acetic acid, and fixation of atmospheric nitrogen were observed
   in different taxa. The potential phototrophy of the strains of the genus
   Polymorphobacter which were cultivated from a lichen for the first time
   was revealed by the presence of genes involved in photosynthesis.
   Altogether, the physiological characteristics of diverse bacterial taxa
   from Antarctic lichens are considered to imply significant roles of
   lichen-associated bacteria to allow lichens to be tolerant or
   competitive in the harsh Antarctic environment.},

Abstract = {To understand fully the risk of biological invasions, it is necessary to
   quantify propagule pressure along all introduction pathways. In the
   Antarctic region, importation of fresh produce is a potentially high
   risk, but as yet unquantified pathway. To address this knowledge gap,
   >11,250 fruit and vegetables sent to nine research stations in
   Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands, were examined for associated
   soil, invertebrates and microbial decomposition. Fifty-one food types
   were sourced from c. 130 locations dispersed across all six of the
   Earth's inhabited continents. On average, 12\% of food items had soil on
   their surface, 28\% showed microbial infection resulting in rot and more
   than 56 invertebrates were recorded, mainly from leafy produce.
   Approximately 30\% of identified fungi sampled from infected foods were
   not recorded previously from within the Antarctic region, although this
   may reflect limited knowledge of Antarctic fungal diversity. The number
   of non-native flying invertebrates caught within the Rothera Research
   Station food storage area was linked closely with the level of fresh
   food resupply by ship and aircraft. We conclude by presenting practical
   biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of non-native species
   introductions to Antarctica associated with fresh foods. (C) 2011

Abstract = {The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are a cold hyperarid polar desert
   that present extreme challenges to life. Here, we report a
   culture-independent survey of multidomain microbial biodiversity in
   McKelvey Valley, a pristine example of the coldest desert on Earth. We
   demonstrate that life has adapted to form highly-specialized communities
   in distinct lithic niches occurring concomitantly within this terrain.
   Endoliths and chasmoliths in sandstone displayed greatest diversity,
   whereas soil was relatively depauperate and lacked a significant
   photoautotrophic component, apart from isolated islands of hypolithic
   cyanobacterial colonization on quartz rocks in soil contact. Communities
   supported previously unreported polar bacteria and fungi, but archaea
   were absent from all niches. Lithic community structure did not vary
   significantly on a landscape scale and stochastic moisture input due to
   snowmelt resulted in increases in colonization frequency without
   significantly affecting diversity. The findings show that biodiversity
   near the cold-arid limit for life is more complex than previously
   appreciated, but communities lack variability probably due to the high
   selective pressures of this extreme environment.},

Title = {Ecuadorian Coptoborus beetles harbor Fusarium and
   Graphium fungi previously associated with Euwallacea
   ambrosia beetles},
Journal = {MYCOLOGIA},

Volume = {114},

Abstract = {Ambrosia beetles from the scolytine tribe Xyleborini (Curculionidae) are
   important to the decomposition of woody plant material on every
   continent except Antarctica. These insects farm fungi on the walls of
   tunnels they build inside recently dead trees and rely on the fungi for
   nutrition during all stages of their lives. Such ambrosia fungi rely on
   the beetles to provide appropriate substrates and environmental
   conditions for growth. A small minority of xyleborine ambrosia
   beetle-fungal partnerships cause significant damage to healthy trees.
   The xyleborine beetle Coptoborus ochromactonus vectors a Fusarium
   (Hypocreales) fungus that is lethal to balsa (Ochroma pyramidale
   (Malvaceae)) trees in Ecuador. Although this pathogenic fungus and its
   associated beetle are not known to be established in the United States,
   several other non-native ambrosia beetle species are vectors of
   destructive plant diseases in this country. This fact and the
   acceleration of trade between South America and the United States
   demonstrate the importance of understanding fungal plant pathogens
   before they escape their native ranges. Here we identify the fungi
   accompanying Coptoborus ambrosia beetles collected in Ecuador.
   Classification based ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS)
   sequences revealed the most prevalent fungi associated with Coptoborus
   are Fusarium sp. and Graphium sp. (Microascales: Microascaceae), which
   have been confirmed as ambrosia fungi for xyleborine ambrosia beetles,
   and Clonostsachys sp. (Hypocreales), which is a diverse genus found
   abundantly in soils and associated with plants. Phylogenetic analyses of
   the Fusarium strains based on ITS, translation elongation factor
   (EF1-alpha), and two subunits of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II
   (RPB1 and RPB2) identified them as Fusarium sp. AF-9 in the Ambrosia
   Fusarium Clade (AFC). This Fusarium species was previously associated
   with a few xyleborine ambrosia beetles, most notably the species complex
   Euwallacea fornicatus (Eichhoff 1868) (Curculionidae: Scolytinae:
   Xyleborini). Examination of ITS and EF1-alpha sequences showed a close
   affinity between the Graphium isolated from Coptoborus spp. and other
   xyleborine-associated Graphium as well as the soil fungus Graphium
   basitruncatum. This characterization of ambrosia fungi through DNA
   sequencing confirms the identity of a putative plant pathogen spread by
   Coptoborus beetles and expands the documented range of Fusarium and
   Graphium ambrosia fungi.},

Abstract = {The spatial patterns of plant and soil N-15 and associated processes in
   the N cycle were investigated at a forest-grassland boundary in northern
   Mongolia. Needles of Larix sibirica Ledeb. and soils collected from two
   study areas were analysed to calculate the differences in N-15 between
   needle and soil (N-15). N-15 showed a clear variation, ranging from -8
   parts per thousand in the forest to -2 parts per thousand in the
   grassland boundary, and corresponded to the accumulation of organic
   layer. In the forest, the separation of available N produced in the soil
   with N-15-depleted N uptake by larch and N-15-enriched N immobilization
   by microorganisms was proposed to cause large N-15, whereas in the
   grassland boundary, small N-15 was explained by the transport of the
   most available N into larch. The divergence of available N between larch
   and microorganisms in the soil, and the accumulation of diverged N in
   the organic layer control the variation in N-15.},

Title = {A Review and Analysis of Rangeland and Wildland Soil Health},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Soil health is focused on intensively managed (IM) soils (often farmed
   soils), by-passing extensively managed (EM) soils (range lands, deserts,
   shrub lands, tundra). High economic value products are generated by IM
   systems. Many EM lands are of cultural, recreational, scenic, or
   scientific value. However, and despite the fact that they provide forage
   for domestic and wild animals, they are not always of high economic
   value. IM and EM soils are evaluated on the same health scales. The
   contention herein is all soils formed under soil state conditions under
   the absence of human interventions are inherently healthy. But a given
   soil has dynamic properties that determine its management as IM or EM.
   An EM sagebrush steppe soil may be deemed unhealthy as a result of low
   organic matter and short growing season. An IM grassland steppe soil is
   healthy as a result of high organic matter and a long growing season.
   The sagebrush soil, however, provides habitat for culturally important
   sage grouse. The grassland soil may provide, when plowed, habitat for
   economically important soybeans. Soil taxonomies can be used to
   establish inherent health of undisturbed soils. Determining a soil's
   dynamic nature is a different construct. Here, four different sets of EM
   soils were evaluated to showcase their diversity, evaluate levels of
   health and display their often-unconventional dynamic characteristics.
   An argument is made that a soil's health, an inherent condition, is not
   the same as its dynamic condition (potential to produce goods and
   services). Soil health changes are usually slowly driven by soil state
   factors but can be dramatically changed by humans. Otherwise, soil
   health can be viewed as a near constant ecosystem attribute. The dynamic
   nature of soils change according to needs placed by humans. EM soils may
   be healthy but lack attention since their dynamic nature is not
   traditional and often of low economic value. Evaluation of soil health
   and dynamic value on EM lands is often exacerbated by information
   absence. Strategies to circumvent this include sampling design,
   reference sites and standardized ways of EM soil health determination. A
   case is made that baselines of soil health can be taken from soil
   surveys, taxonomic names, and soil data from map units, where such
   information exists. Certified supplementary information is ambiguously
   available, but may be crucial. Outdoor living laboratories that feature
   inherent soil health and dynamic soil alternatives may help circumvent
   information voids.},

   Wuyishan National Park (China), Crinipellis bidens from Hubei Province
   (China), Lactifluus sainii from Himalayan India, Inocybe elata from
   Yunnan (China), Inocybe himalayensis from Pakistan. Specimens previously
   identified as Massalongia carnosa represent a new species, namely M.
   patagonica restricted to southern South America. Saprolegnia maragheica
   is a new oomycete species of fresh water in Maraghe (Iran). Uncispora
   wuzhishanensis is a new aquatic hyphomycete species. A type specimen of
   Raddetes turkestanicus was studied and based on this the new combination
   Conocybe turkestanica, is proposed. Argyranthemum frutescens is a new
   host for Alternaria alternata and Syzygium cumini for Phyllosticta
   capitalensis in India. Crepidotus ehrendorferi is confirmed for Hungary
   and Pluteus leucoborealis for Central Europe, and for the
   phytogeographical region of Carpaticum. Pseudopithomyces palmicola is
   shown to occur on grapevine and it is validated by adding a unique
   identifier. Terfezia fanfani is reported first from Algeria.},

Abstract = {Bulk paleosol samples collected from a Middle to Early Miocene moraine
   in the New Mountain area of the Dry Valleys, Antarctica, yielded
   Coleoptera exoskeletons and occasional endoskeletons showing
   considerable diagenetic effects along with several species of bacteria,
   all lodged in a dry-frozen but salt-rich horizon at shallow depth to the
   land surface. The till is at the older end of a chronologic sequence of
   glacial deposits, thought to have been deposited before the transition
   from wet-based to cold-based ice (similar to 15 Ma), and hence, entirely
   weathered in contact with the subaerial atmosphere. It is possible,
   though not absolutely verifiable, that the skeletons date from this
   early stage of emplacement having undergone modifications whenever light
   snowmelt occurred or salt concentrations lowered the freezing
   temperature to maintain water as liquid. Correlation of the Coleoptera
   species with cultured bacteria in the sample and the likelihood of
   co-habitation with Beauveria bassiani found in two adjacent, although
   younger paleosols, leads to new questions about the antiquity of the
   Coleoptera and the source of N and glucose from chitinase derived from
   the insects. The skeletons in the 831 section may date close to the
   oldest preserved chitin (Oligocene) yet found on Earth. While harsh
   Martian conditions make it seemingly intolerable for complex,
   multicellular organisms such as insects to exist in the near-surface and
   subaerially, life within similar cold, dry paleosol microenvironments
   (Cryosols) of Antarctica point to life potential for the Red Planet,
   especially when considering the relatively diverse microbe (bacteria and
   fungi) population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The effects of artificial ultraviolet radiation {[}UVR; 8 W m(-2)
   ultraviolet-A (UVA), 0.4 W m(-2) ultraviolet-B (UVB)] on photosynthetic
   performance, growth and the capability to synthesise mycosporine-like
   amino acids (MAAs) was investigated in the aeroterrestrial green algae
   Stichococcus sp. and Chlorella luteoviridis forming biofilms on building
   facades, and compared with the responses of two green algae, from soil
   (Myrmecia incisa) and brackish water (Desmodesmus subspicatus). All
   species exhibited decreasing quantum efficiency (F-v/F-m) after 1-3 days
   exposure to UVR. After 8-12 days treatment, however, all aeroterrestrial
   isolates exhibited full recovery under UVA and UVA/B. In contrast, D.
   subspicatus showed only 80\% recovery after treatment with UVB. While
   Stichococcus sp. and C. luteoviridis exhibited a broad tolerance in
   growth under all radiation conditions tested, M. incisa showed a
   significant decrease in growth rate after exposure to UVA and UVA/B.
   Similarly D. subspicatus grew with a reduced rate under UVA, but UVA/B
   led to full inhibition. Using HPLC, an UVabsorbing MAA (324 nm-MAA) was
   identified in Stichococcus sp. and C. luteoviridis. While M. incisa
   contained a specific 322 nm-MAA, D. subspicatus lacked any trace of such
   compounds. UV-exposure experiments indicated that all MAA-containing
   species are capable of synthesizing and accumulating these compounds,
   thus supporting their function as an UV-sunscreen. All data well explain
   the conspicuous ecological success of aeroterrestrial green algae in
   biofilms on facades. Biosynthesis and accumulation of MAAs under UVR
   seem to result in a reduced UV-sensitivity of growth and photosynthesis,
   which consequently may enhance survival in the environmentally harsh
   habitat.},

Abstract = {As Earth's climate warms, soil carbon pools and the microbial
   communities that process them may change, altering the way in which
   carbon is recycled in soil. In this study, we used a combination of
   metagenomics and bacterial cultivation to evaluate the hypothesis that
   experimentally raising soil temperatures by 5 degrees C for 5, 8, or 20
   years increased the potential for temperate forest soil microbial
   communities to degrade carbohydrates. Warming decreased the proportion
   of carbohydrate-degrading genes in the organic horizon derived from
   eukaryotes and increased the fraction of genes in the mineral soil
   associated with Actinobacteria in all studies. Genes associated with
   carbohydrate degradation increased in the organic horizon after 5 years
   of warming but had decreased in the organic horizon after warming the
   soil continuously for 20 years. However, a greater proportion of the 295
   bacteria from 6 phyla (10 classes, 14 orders, and 34 families) isolated
   from heated plots in the 20-year experiment were able to depolymerize
   cellulose and xylan than bacterial isolates from control soils.
   Together, these findings indicate that the enrichment of bacteria
   capable of degrading carbohydrates could be important for accelerated
   carbon cycling in a warmer world.},

Abstract = {Soil formation is the result of a complex network of biological as well
   as chemical and physical processes. The role of soil microbes is of high
   interest, since they are responsible for most biological transformations
   and drive the development of stable and labile pools of carbon (C),
   nitrogen (N) and other nutrients, which facilitate the subsequent
   establishment of plant communities. Forefields of receding glaciers
   provide unique chronosequences of different soil development stages and
   are ideal ecosystems to study the interaction of bacteria, fungi and
   archaea with their abiotic environment. In this review we give insights
   into the role of microbes for soil development. The results presented
   are based on studies performed within the Collaborative Research Program
   DFG SFB/TRR 38 (http://www.tu-cottbus.de/ecosystem) and are supplemented
   by data from other studies. The review focusses on the microbiology of
   major steps of soil formation. Special attention is given to the
   development of nutrient cycles on the formation of biological soil
   crusts (BSCs) and on the establishment of plant-microbe interactions.},

Journal = {RSC ADVANCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the potential of the non-lignolytic
   filamentous fungus Penicillium sp. CHY-2, isolated from Antarctic soil,
   for the biodegradation of eight different aliphatic and aromatic
   hydrocarbons such as octane, decane, dodecane, ethylbenzene,
   butylbenzene, naphthalene, acenaphthene, and benzo{[}a] pyrene. Among
   all the compounds, CHY-2 showed the highest level of degradation for
   decane (49.0\%), followed by butylbenzene (42.0\%) and dodecane
   (33.0\%), and lower levels of degradation for naphthalene (15.0\%),
   acenaphthene (10.0\%), octane (8.0\%), ethylbenzene (4.0\%), and
   benzo{[}a] pyrene (2.0\%) at 20 degrees C. The addition of carbon
   sources such as glucose (5 g L-1) and Tween-80 (5 g L-1) enhanced decane
   degradation by about 1.8-fold and 1.61-fold respectively at 20 degrees
   C. The metabolites produced during the degradation of decane were
   identified by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore,
   the enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP) from CHY-2 was purified. MnP was
   found to consist of monomers with a molecular mass of 36 kDa. The
   purified MnP had an optimum pH of 5.0 and temperature of 30 degrees C.
   The K-m and V-max values of MnP towards Mn2+ were 1.31 mu M and 185.19
   mu M min(-1) respectively. These results indicated that the strain CHY-2
   can be used for the degradation of hydrocarbons and could have promising
   applications in treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated sites.},

Abstract = {A novel actinomycete, strain W6(T), was isolated from a soil sample of
   Yunnan Province, China. The bacterium was aerobic, non-motile,
   non-spore-forming and Gram-stain-positive. Genetic, phenotypic and
   chemical properties of the isolate were studied. 16S rRNA gene sequence
   data suggested that the novel isolate belonged to the genus
   Friedmanniella and shared 98.6\% sequence similarity with Friedmanniella
   antarctica DSM 11053(T) and Friedmanniella okinawensis DSM 21744(T), the
   most closely related species. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained
   LL-diaminopimelic acid, and mycolic acids were absent. The main
   menaquinone was MK-9(H-4) and the predominant fatty acids were
   anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-15:0. The phospholipid profile contained
   phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and
   diphosphatidylglycerol. The DNA G+C content of strain W6(T) was 72
   mol\%. Strain W6(T) showed 30.0\% and 28.5\% DNA-DNA relatedness,
   respectively, to F. antarctica DSM 11053(T) and F. okinawensis DSM
   21744(T). The combined genotypic and phenotypic data showed that strain
   W6(T) should be assigned to the genus Friedmanniella as a representative
   of a novel species, for which the name Friedmanniella flava sp. nov. is
   proposed. The type strain is W6(T) (=CGMCC 4.6856(T)=JCM 17701(T)).},

Title = {Fumarole-Supported Islands of Biodiversity within a Hyperarid,

Abstract = {Fumarolic activity supports the growth of mat-like photoautotrophic
   communities near the summit (at 6,051 m) of Socompa Volcano in the arid
   core of the Andes mountains. These communities are isolated within a
   barren, high-elevation landscape where sparse vascular plants extend to
   only 4,600 m. Here, we combine biogeochemical and molecular-phylogenetic
   approaches to characterize the bacterial and eucaryotic assemblages
   associated with fumarolic and nonfumarolic grounds on Socompa.
   Small-subunit rRNA genes were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced from
   two fumarolic soil samples and two reference soil samples, including the
   volcanic debris that covers most of the mountain. The nonfumarolic, dry,
   volcanic soil was similar in nutrient status to the most extreme
   Antarctic Dry Valley or Atacama Desert soils, hosted relatively limited
   microbial communities dominated by Actinobacteria and Fungi, and
   contained no photoautotrophs. In contrast, modest fumarolic inputs were
   associated with elevated soil moisture and nutrient levels, the presence
   of chlorophyll a, and C-13-rich soil organic carbon. Moreover, this soil
   hosted diverse photoautotroph-dominated assemblages that contained novel
   lineages and exhibited structure and composition comparable to those of
   a wetland near the base of Socompa ( 3,661-m elevation).
   Fumarole-associated eucaryotes were particularly diverse, with an
   abundance of green algal lineages and a novel clade of microarthropods.
   Our data suggest that volcanic degassing of water and C-13-rich CO2
   sustains fumarole-associated primary producers, leading to a complex
   microbial ecosystem within this otherwise barren landscape. Finally, we
   found that human activities have likely impacted the fumarolic soils and
   that fumarole-supported photoautotrophic communities may be
   exceptionally sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance.},

Abstract = {The cryptic lifestyle of most fungi necessitates molecular
   identification of the guild in environmental studies. Over the past
   decades, rapid development and affordability of molecular tools have
   tremendously improved insights of the fungal diversity in all ecosystems
   and habitats. Yet, in spite of the progress of molecular methods,
   knowledge about functional properties of the fungal taxa is vague and
   interpretation of environmental studies in an ecologically meaningful
   manner remains challenging. In order to facilitate functional
   assignments and ecological interpretation of environmental studies we
   introduce a user friendly traits and character database FungalTraits
   operating at genus and species hypothesis levels. Combining the
   information from previous efforts such as FUNGuild and Fun(Fun) together
   with involvement of expert knowledge, we reannotated 10,210 and 151
   fungal and Stramenopila genera, respectively. This resulted in a
   stand-alone spreadsheet dataset covering 17 lifestyle related traits of
   fungal and Stramenopila genera, designed for rapid functional
   assignments of environmental studies. In order to assign the trait
   states to fungal species hypotheses, the scientific community of experts
   manually categorised and assigned available trait information to 697,413
   fungal ITS sequences. On the basis of those sequences we were able to
   summarise trait and host information into 92,623 fungal species
   hypotheses at 1\% dissimilarity threshold.},

Abstract = {Antarctic microorganisms have developed different strategies to live in
   their environments, including modifications to their membrane components
   to regulate fluidity and the production of photoprotective metabolites
   such as carotenoids. Three yeast colonies (ANCH01, ANCH06 and ANCH08)
   were isolated from soil samples collected at King George Island, which
   according to their rDNA sequence analyses, were determined to be
   Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. This yeast is of biotechnological
   interest, because it can synthesize astaxanthin as its main carotenoid,
   which is a powerful antioxidant pigment used in aquaculture. Then, the
   aim of this work was to characterize the ANCH isolates at their
   molecular and phenotypic level. The isolates did not display any
   differences in their rDNA and COX1 gene nucleotide sequences. However,
   ANCH01 produces approximately sixfold more astaxanthin than other wild
   type strains. Moreover, even though ANCH06 and ANCH08 produce
   astaxanthin, their main carotenoid was beta-carotene. In contrast to
   other X. dendrorhous strains, the ANCH isolates did not produce
   mycosporines. Finally, the ANCH isolates had a higher proportion of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids than other wild type strains. In conclusion,
   the reported X. dendrorhous isolates are phenotypically different from
   other wild type strains, including characteristics that could make them
   more resistant and better able to inhabit their original habitat, which
   may also have biotechnological potential.},

Abstract = {Zoosporic fungi of the phylum Chytridiomycota (chytrids) regularly
   dominate pelagic fungal communities in freshwater and marine
   environments. Their lifestyles range from obligate parasites to
   saprophytes. Yet, linking the scarce available sequence data to specific
   ecological traits or their host ranges constitutes currently a major
   challenge. We combined 28 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with targeted
   isolation and sequencing approaches, along with cross-infection assays
   and analysis of chytrid infection prevalence to obtain new insights into
   chytrid diversity, ecology, and seasonal dynamics in a temperate lake.
   Parasitic phytoplankton-chytrid and saprotrophic pollen-chytrid
   interactions made up the majority of zoosporic fungal reads. We
   explicitly demonstrate the recurrent dominance of parasitic chytrids
   during frequent diatom blooms and saprotrophic chytrids during pollen
   rains. Distinct temporal dynamics of diatom-specific parasitic clades
   suggest mechanisms of coexistence based on niche differentiation and
   competitive strategies. The molecular and ecological information on
   chytrids generated in this study will aid further exploration of their
   spatial and temporal distribution patterns worldwide. To fully exploit
   the power of environmental sequencing for studies on chytrid ecology and
   evolution, we emphasize the need to intensify current isolation efforts
   of chytrids and integrate taxonomic and autecological data into
   long-term studies and experiments.},

Abstract = {Shape and physico-chemical properties of the scissile fatty acid binding
   sites of six lipases and two serine esterases were analyzed and compared
   in order to understand the molecular basis of substrate specificity. All
   eight serine esterases and lipases have similar architecture and
   catalytic mechanism of ester hydrolysis, but different substrate
   specificities for the acyl moiety. Lipases and esterases differ in the
   geometry of their binding sites, lipases have a large, hydrophobic
   scissile fatty acid binding site, esterases like acetylcholinesterase
   and bromoperoxidase have a small acyl binding pocket, which fits exactly
   to their favorite substrates. The lipases were subdivided into three
   sub-groups: (1) lipases with a hydrophobic, crevice-like binding site
   located near the protein surface (lipases from Rhizomucor and Rhizopus);
   (2) lipases with a funnel-like binding site (lipases from Candida
   antarctica, Pseudomonas and mammalian pancreas and cutinase); and (3)
   lipases with a tunnel-like binding site (lipase from Candida rugosa).
   The length of the scissile fatty acid binding site varies considerably
   among the lipases between 7.8 Angstrom in cutinase and 22 Angstrom in
   Candida rugosa and Rhizomucor miehei lipase. Location and properties of
   the scissile fatty acid binding sites of all lipases of known structure
   were characterized. Our model also identifies the residues which mediate
   chain length specificity and thus may guide protein engineering of
   lipases for changed chain length specificity. The model was supported by
   published experimental data on the chain length specificity profile of
   various lipases and on mutants of fungal lipases with changed fatty acid
   chain length specificity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the ability to produce
   extracellular hydrolytic enzymes at low temperature of yeasts isolated
   from 25 de Mayo island, Antarctica, and to identify those exhibiting one
   or more of the evaluated enzymatic activities. A total of 105 yeast
   isolates were obtained from different samples and 66 were identified.
   They belonged to 12 basidiomycetous and four ascomycetous genera. Most
   of the isolates were ascribed to the genera Cryptococcus, Mrakia,
   Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, Gueomyces, Phenoliferia, Leucosporidium, and
   Pichia. Results from enzymes production at low temperatures revealed
   that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse cultivable
   yeasts, which represent potential tools for biotechnological
   applications. While most the isolates proved to produce 2-4 of the
   investigated exoenzymes, two of them evidenced the six evaluated
   enzymatic activities: Pichia caribbica and Guehomyces pullulans, which
   were characterized as psycrotolerant and psycrophilic, respectively. In
   addition, P. caribbica could assimilate several n-alkanes and diesel
   fuel. The enzyme production profile and hydrocarbons assimilation
   capacity, combined with its high level of biomass production and the
   extended exponential growth phase make P. caribbica a promising tool for
   cold environments biotechnological purposes in the field of cold-enzymes
   production and oil spills bioremediation as well.},

Title = {Field and lab conditions alter microbial enzyme and biomass dynamics
   driving decomposition of the same leaf litter},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Fluctuations in climate and edaphic factors influence field
   decomposition rates and preclude a complete understanding of how
   microbial communities respond to plant litter quality. In contrast,
   laboratory microcosms isolate the intrinsic effects of litter chemistry
   and microbial community from extrinsic effects of environmental
   variation. Used together, these paired approaches provide mechanistic
   insights to decomposition processes. In order to elucidate the microbial
   mechanisms underlying how environmental conditions alter the trajectory
   of decay, we characterized microbial biomass, respiration, enzyme
   activities, and nutrient dynamics during early (<10\% mass loss), mid-
   (10-40\% mass loss), and late (>40\% mass loss) decay in parallel field
   and laboratory litter bag incubations for deciduous tree litters with
   varying recalcitrance (dogwood < maple < maple-oak mixture < oak). In
   the field, mass loss was minimal (<10\%) over the first 50 days (January
   February), even for labile litter types, despite above-freezing soil
   temperatures and adequate moisture during these winter months. In
   contrast, microcosms displayed high C mineralization rates in the first
   week. During mid-decay, the labile dogwood and maple litters in the
   field had higher mass loss per unit enzyme activity than the lab,
   possibly due to leaching of soluble compounds. Microbial biomass to
   litter mass (B:C) ratios peaked in the field during late decay, but B:C
   ratios declined between mid- and late decay in the lab. Thus, microbial
   biomass did not have a consistent relationship with litter quality
   between studies. Higher oxidative enzyme activities in oak litters in
   the field, and higher nitrogen (N) accumulation in the lab microcosms
   occurred in late decay. We speculate that elevated N suppressed fungal
   activity and/or biomass in microcosms. Our results suggest that
   differences in microbial biomass and enzyme dynamics alter the decay
   trajectory of the same leaf litter under field and lab conditions.},

Abstract = {Little is known about microbial ecosystems of interior Antarctica, if
   indeed such ecosystems exist. Although considerable research has
   assessed microorganisms indigenous to coastal regions of Antarctica,
   particularly their lakes, ponds, and soils, to our knowledge only one
   characterized bacterium, a strain of Pseudomonas, has been isolated from
   South Pole ice or snow. Metagenomic community analyses described in this
   work and elsewhere reveal that a diversity of bacteria exists in inland
   polar snows, yet attempts to culture and characterize these microbes
   from this extreme environment have been few to date. In this molecular
   and culture-dependent investigation of the microbiology of inland
   Antarctica, we enriched and isolated two new strains of bacteria and one
   strain of yeast (Fungi) from South Pole snow samples. The bacteria were
   of the genera Methylobacterium and Sphingomonas, and the yeast grouped
   with species of Naganishia (class Tremellocytes). In addition to
   phylogenetic analyses, characterization of these isolates included
   determinations of cell morphology, growth as a function of temperature,
   salinity tolerance, and carbon and energy source versatility. All
   organisms were found to be cold-adapted, and the yeast strain
   additionally showed considerable halotolerance. These descriptions
   expand our understanding of the diversity and metabolic activities of
   snowbound microorganisms of interior Antarctica.},

Abstract = {Various microbial groups are well known to produce a range of

   occurrence and importance of investment in such activities have received
   relatively limited attention in studies of Antarctic soil microbiota.
   Sixty-one yeasts strains were isolated from King George Island,
   Antarctica which were characterized physiologically and identified at
   the molecular level using the D1/D2 region of rDNA. Fifty-eight yeasts
   (belonging to the genera Cryptococcus, Leucosporidiella, Rhodotorula,
   Guehomyces, Candida, Metschnikowia and Debaryomyces) were screened for
   extracellular amylolytic, proteolytic, esterasic, pectinolytic,
   inulolytic xylanolytic and cellulolytic activities at low and moderate
   temperatures. Esterase activity was the most common enzymatic activity
   expressed by the yeast isolates regardless the assay temperature and
   inulinase was the second most common enzymatic activity. No cellulolytic
   activity was detected. One yeast identified as Guehomyces pullulans (8E)
   showed significant activity across six of seven enzymes types tested.
   Twenty-eight yeast isolates were classified as oleaginous, being the
   isolate 8E the strain that accumulated the highest levels of
   saponifiable lipids (42 \%).},

Abstract = {Four Gram-positive, non-motile, aerobic actinobacteria were isolated
   from spiders and their webs. Their genetic, phenotypic and chemical
   properties were studied. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data suggested that
   the four novel isolates belonged to the genus Friedmanniella. Two
   strains (FA1(T) and FA2(T)) formed a cluster together with
   Friedmanniella capsulata and Friedmanniella lacustris and the other two
   strains (FB1(T) and FB2(T)) formed a cluster together with
   Friedmanniella antarctica and Friedmanniella spumicola. The cell-wall
   peptidoglycan contained LL-A(2)pm and mycolic acids were absent.
   Isoprenoid quinones were mainly composed of MK-9(H4), MK-9(H2) and MK-9
   and the predominant fatty acids were 12-methyltetradecanoic acid
   (ai-C-15:0) and 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (i-C-15:0). The major polar
   lipids were phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol. In addition,
   strain FA1(T), FB1(T), and FB2(T) contained diphosphatidylglycerol and
   phosphatidylcholine. The DNA G + C contents were: 72 mol\%, 73 mol\%, 74
   mol\% and 75 mol\% for strains FA1(T), FA2(T), FB1(T), and FB2(T),
   respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization studies demonstrated that the novel
   strains showed low relatedness values to F. capsulata, F. lacustris, F.
   antarctica and F. spumicola. These data support the proposal that
   strains FA1(T), FA2(T), FB1(T) and FB2(T) represent novel species of the
   genus Friedmanniella. Therefore, the names Friedmanniella luteola (type
   strain FA1(T) =DSM 21741(T) =NBRC 104963(T)), Friedmanniella lucida
   (type strain FA2(T) =DSM 21742(T) =NBRC 104964(T)), Friedmanniella
   okinawensis (type strain FB1(T) =DSM 21744(T) =NBRC 104966(T)) and
   Friedmanniella sagamiharensis (type strain FB2(T) =DSM 21743(T) =NBRC
   104965(T)) are proposed for these new strains.},

Title = {Assessment of Diversity of Culturable Marine Yeasts Associated with
   Corals and Zoanthids in the Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Marine yeasts can occur in a wide range of habitats, including in marine
   invertebrates, in which they may play important roles; however,
   investigation of marine yeasts in marine invertebrates is scarce.
   Therefore, this study aims to explore the diversity of yeasts associated
   with corals and zoanthids in the Gulf of Thailand. Thirty-three coral
   and seven zoanthid samples were collected at two sampling sites near Mu
   and Khram islands. Fifty yeast strains were able to be isolated from 25
   of the 40 samples collected. Identification based on sequence analyses
   of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rRNA gene revealed a higher
   number of strains in the phylum Basidiomycota (68\%) than in the phylum
   Ascomycota. The ascomycetous yeasts comprised nine known species from
   four genera (Candida, Meyerozyma, Kodamaea, and Wickerhamomyces),
   whereas the basidiomycetous yeasts comprised 10 known species from eight
   genera (Vishniacozyma, Filobasidium, Naganishia, Papiliotrema,
   Sterigmatomyces, Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, and Rhodosporidiobolus) and
   one potentially new species. The species with the highest occurrence was
   Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA)
   ordination, no marked differences were found in the yeast communities
   from the two sampling sites. The estimation of the expected richness of
   species was higher than the actual richness of species observed.},

Title = {An Investigation into the Potential of a Penicillium Commune Strain to
   Eliminate Aromatic Compounds},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The quantity of industrially polluted waters is increasing everywhere,
   of which a significant part is occupied by a number of mono- and
   poly-aromatic compounds. Toxins enter the soil, sewage, and clean water
   by mixing with or seeping into them from industrial wastewater. By using
   18S RNA and ITS sequences, the Penicillium commune AL5 strain that was
   isolated from Antarctic soil was identified. This study is dedicated to
   exploring its capacity to metabolize hazardous aromatic compounds. The
   strain showed very good potential in the degradation of hydroxylated
   monophenols and possessed exceptional abilities in terms of resorcinol
   degradation. The strain's ability to metabolize 0.3 g/L of p-cresol at
   10 ? is notable. The strain is also capable of metabolizing LMW PAHs
   (naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene) and eliminating all three
   tested compounds under 23 ?, respectively, 77.5\%, 93.8\%, and 75.1\%.
   At 10 ?, the process slowed down, but the degradation of naphthalene
   continued to be over 50\%. The quantity of PAH and a few significant
   intermediary metabolites were determined using GC-MS analysis.
   Sequencing of the enzymes phenol hydroxylase and catechol
   1,2-dioxygenase revealed a close association with the genes and proteins
   in some fungal strains that can degrade the aromatic compounds examined
   thus far.},

Title = {Host identity is the dominant factor in the assembly of nematode and

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Recent work examining nematode and tardigrade gut microbiomes has
   identified species-specific relationships between host and gut community
   composition. However, only a handful of species from either phylum have
   been examined. How microbiomes differ among species and what factors
   contribute to their assembly remains unexplored. Cyanobacterial mats
   within Antarctic Dry Valley streams host a simple and tractable natural
   ecosystem of identifiable microinvertebrates to address these questions.
   We sampled 2 types of coexisting mats (i.e., black and orange) across
   four spatially isolated streams, hand-picked single individuals of two
   nematode species (i.e., Eudorylaimus antarcticus and Plectus murrayi)
   and tardigrades, to examine their gut microbiomes using 16S and 18S rRNA
   metabarcoding. All gut microbiomes (bacterial and eukaryotic) were
   significantly less diverse than the mats they were isolated from. In
   contrast to mats, microinvertebrates' guts were depleted of
   Cyanobacteria and differentially enriched in taxa of Bacteroidetes,
   Proteobacteria, and Fungi. Among factors investigated, gut microbiome
   composition was most influenced by host identity while environmental
   factors (e.g., mats and streams) were less important. The importance of
   host identity in predicting gut microbiome composition suggests
   functional value to the host, similar to other organisms with strong
   host selected microbiomes.},

Abstract = {Agricultural mulch films made from biodegradable polymers (BP) have been
   used to decrease the burden of plastic waste recovery and recycling.
   However, their degradations depend largely on environmental conditions
   and sometimes do not proceed as desired. Yeast strains of Pseudozyma
   antarctica often isolated from rice husks were found to secrete an
   esterase to degrade BP films. Poly-butylene succinate-co-adipate (PBSA)
   films buried in unsterilized rice husks with 60\% (w/w) moisture
   degraded rapidly compared to that buried in field soil. The type strain
   of P. antarctica JCM 10317 added as cell suspension onto sterilized rice
   husks with PBSA film grew rapidly forming filamentous growth on the
   surface of rice husks and films. BP-degrading enzyme secreted by the
   growing cells was adsorbed on the surface of film and decomposed the
   film. Addition of rice husk-derived P. antarctica strains also showed BP
   film degradation activity in sterilized rice husks. In the light of
   these findings, we suggest that techniques for disposal of used BPs
   which combine plastics with unutilized residual plant materials piled at
   the side of agricultural fields be developed. (C) 2017, The Society for

Abstract = {Mats of coenocytic ``snow molds{''} are commonly observed covering the
   soil and litter of alpine and subalpine areas immediately following snow
   melt. Here, we describe the phylogenetic placement, growth rates, and
   metabolic potential of cold-adapted fungi from under-snow mats in the
   subalpine forests of Colorado. SSU rDNA sequencing revealed that these
   fungi belong to the zygomycete orders Mucorales and Mortierellales. All
   of the isolates could grow at temperatures observed under the snow at
   our sites (0 degrees C and -2 degrees C) but were unable to grow at
   temperatures above 25 degrees C and were unable to grow anaerobically.
   Growth rates for these fungi were very high at -2 degrees C,
   approximately an order of magnitude faster than previously studied
   cold-tolerant fungi from Antarctic soils. Given the rapid aerobic growth
   of these fungi at low temperatures, we propose that they are uniquely
   adapted to take advantage of the flush of nutrient that occurs at the
   soil-snow interface beneath late winter snow packs. In addition,
   extracellular enzyme production was relatively high for the Mucorales,
   but quite low for the Mortierellales, perhaps indicating some niche
   separation between these fungi beneath the late winter snow pack.},

   ANTARCTIC PEAT},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {1982},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {Seasonal variations in temperature and moisture in moss peat were
   monitored in the field at Signy Island, Antarctica. When simulated in
   intact peat cores in vitro after frozen storage, these variations caused
   changes on O2 uptake which closely reproduced the results for fresh
   samples. Respiration rate was used as a measure of aerobic decomposer
   activity. Supplements of sugars indicated the predominance of microbial
   respiration and its dependence on the availability of dissolved organic
   C (DOC). Low temperatures of 0.degree. to 1.degree. C were not
   rate-limiting for respiration in vivo or in vitro, and O2 uptake was
   detected at -1.degree. C. Repeated peaks of O2-uptake under wet
   conditions resulting from simulated spring freeze-thaw cycles, and a
   solitary peak during an autumn simulation, suggested release of DOC
   substrares from frost-damaged cells. Desiccation, microfaunal predation
   and microaerophily were thought to contribute to respiratory declines.
   O2-uptake and CO2-evolution were equivalent in peat beneath Polytrichum
   sampled in autumn. Peat respiration was not generally proportional to
   microbial biomass, but saccharolytic yeasts were dominant during the
   respiratory maximum in spring and correlated with O2-uptake in a mixed
   culture of indigenous microflora. Yeasts grew exponentially in freeze
   thaw cycle stimulations but percolated into the peat profile in the
   field. The basal O2 uptake, which may be attributable to the
   decomposition of recalcitrant molecules such as cellulose, was lower in
   simulations of spring than autumn. Although bacterial biomass increased
   and diversified during summer, the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial
   contributions to O2-uptake in an incubated homogenate of peat sampled in
   autumn was 4:1.},

   phosphate concentration (PLP; 115-137 nmol PLP/gdw) was nearly 10 times
   that of Antarctic sandstone, at least twice that in an architectural red
   sandstone, and approached that found in soils. Amounts of chlorophyll a
   were higher than those for the Antarctic sandstone (known to contain
   algae and cyanobacteria) and were at the lower end of the range reported
   for soils. The high biomass is supported by photosynthetic carbon input,
   and hypotheses are presented that describe the role of these epi- and
   endolithic communities in the weathering of their substrata.},

Abstract = {During a survey of carotenogenic yeasts from cold and oligotrophic
   environments in Patagonia, several yeasts of the genus Dioszegia
   (Tremellales, Agaricomycotina) were detected, including three strains
   that could not be assigned to any known taxa. Analyses of internal
   transcribed spacer and D1/D2 regions of the large subunit rRNA gene
   showed these strains are conspecific with several other strains found in
   the Italian Alps and in Antarctica soil. Phylogenetic analyses showed
   that 19 of these strains represent a novel yeast species of the genus
   Dioszegia. The name Dioszegia patagonica sp. nov. is proposed to
   accommodate these strains and CRUB 1147(T) (UFMG 195(T) = CBMAI 1564(T)
   = DBVPG 10618(T) = CBS 14901(T); MycoBank MB 819782) was designated as

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {3},

Abstract = {An investigation was made into the occurrence and biodiversity of
   Geodermatophilaceae on 78 samples of altered stone surfaces from 24
   monuments and natural stones in the Mediterranean basin; it was found
   that the total microbial counts ranged between 0 and 10(7) cfu g(-1) dry
   weight. Members of the Geodermatophilaceae family were isolated from 22
   of the 78 samples examined, with the incidence of Geodermatophilaceae
   colonies in the cultivable population ranging from 1\% to 100\%. The
   highest percentage was found in six samples of markedly deteriorated
   stone. Sixty-five strains randomly isolated from the plates were
   clustered in six different groups by amplified 16S rDNA restriction
   analysis (ARDRA) using five different restriction enzymes. Twenty-five
   strains, representing all the ARDRA haplotypes, were characterized
   further by partial sequencing (350-550 bp) of the 16S rDNA and by
   analysing 76 morphological, metabolic and physiological properties. The
   strains were associated with three well-separated clusters of the genera
   Geodermatophilus, Blastococcus and Modestobacter. On the basis of 16S
   rDNA sequence and ARDRA analysis, only two strains were found to be
   related to the two reference strains of Geodermatophilus. All the others
   could be grouped with Blastococcus aggregatus (19 strains) or the
   Antarctic species Modestobacter multiseptatus (44 strains), suggesting
   that it is these two groups, rather than Geodermatophilus, that tend to
   colonize the stone surfaces, and that Modestobacter-like strains are
   also found in temperate/Mediterranean climates. From the BOX-polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) data, it can be seen that the Modestobacter-like
   strains, belonging to the most represented ARDRA haplotype (haplotype B,
   34 strains), are very polymorphic and that, over a stone surface, there
   is a wide genetic diversity at the microsite level.},

Abstract = {Polar glacier forefields offer an unprecedented framework for studying
   community assembly processes in regions that are geographically and
   climatically isolated. Through amplicon sequence variant (ASV)
   inference, we compared the composition and structure of soil bacterial
   communities from glacier forefields in Iceland and Antarctica to assess
   overlap between communities and the impact of established cryptogamic
   covers on the uniqueness of their taxa. These pioneer microbial
   communities were found to share only 8\% of ASVs and each taxonomic
   group's contribution to the shared ASV data subset was heterogeneous and
   independent of their relative abundance. Although the presence of ASVs
   specific to one glacier forefield and/or different cryptogam cover
   values confirms the existence of habitat specialist bacteria, our data
   show that the influence of cryptogams on the edaphic bacterial community
   structure also varied also depending on the taxonomic group. Hence, the
   establishment of distinct cryptogamic covers is probably not the only
   factor driving the uniqueness of bacterial communities at both poles.
   The structure of bacterial communities colonising deglaciated areas
   seems also conditioned by lineage-specific limitations in their
   dispersal capacity and/or their establishment and persistence in these
   isolated and hostile regions.},

Abstract = {Environmental factors influencing the occurrence and community structure
   of soil yeasts in forests are not well studied. There are few studies
   dedicated to Southern Hemisphere soil yeasts populations and even fewer
   focused on temperate forests influenced by volcanic activity. The
   present work aimed to study the ecology of soil yeast communities from
   pristine forests influenced by different environmental factors
   (precipitation, physicochemical properties of soil, tree species, soil
   region, and season). The survey was performed in 4 northern Patagonian
   forests: 2 dominated by Nothofagus pumilio and 2 by Nothofagus
   antarctica. Yeast communities were described with ecological indices and
   species accumulation curves, and their association with environmental
   characteristics was assessed using multivariate analysis. Each forest
   site showed a particular arrangement of species as a result of
   environmental characteristics, such as dominant plant species, nutrient
   availability, and climatic characteristics. Cryptococcus podzolicus was
   most frequently isolated in nutrient-rich soils, Trichosporon porosum
   dominated cold mountain forests with low nutrient and water availability
   in soil, and capsulated yeasts such as Cryptococcus phenolicus dominated
   forest sites with low precipitation. The present work suggests that
   environmental factors affecting yeast communities may not be the current
   soil characteristics but the result of complex interactions of factors
   including natural disturbances like volcanic activity.},

Abstract = {The genus Chodatodesmus belongs to the coccoid representatives of the
   family Scenedesmaceae with very scarce diagnostic traits. This genus
   includes two species, C. mucronulatus (the type species of the genus)
   and C. australis, which differ genetically. Until recently, data on the
   species diversity of Chodatodesmus and their biogeography were based on
   the study of a number of isolated strains. Records of the species were
   limited to the aquatic ecosystems of Turkey, Peru, and Antarctica. Here,
   we characterized the new strains of Chodatodesmus, IRK-A 290 and 449,
   from Lake Baikal by combining morphological (LM, SEM, TEM) and molecular
   phylogenetic (SSU rRNA, ITS, rbcL, and tufA) methods. The studied
   strains belonged to different species of the genus that were first
   recorded in Eurasia. The strain IRK-A 290 was referred to C. australis,
   and IRK-A 449 was described as a new species Chodatodesmus intermedia
   sp. nov. For the analysis, we also used sequences from soil metagenomes
   obtained within the project on the global distribution of fungi and
   deposited in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Chodatodesmus
   nucleotide sequences were found in soils in different regions of the
   world. This study showed that the majority of sequences from soil
   metagenomes refer to C. australis, and several sequences belong to the
   new phylogenetic clade of Chodatodesmus intermedia sp. nov. Sequences of
   C. mucronulatus were not detected in soils. The results obtained add to
   the data on the species diversity, morphology, genetic features,
   distribution, and occurrence of Chodatodesmus.},

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Microbes growing at subzero temperatures encounter numerous growth
   constraints. However, fungi that inhabit cold environments can grow and
   decompose organic compounds under subzero temperatures. Thus,
   understanding the cold-adaptation strategies of fungi under extreme
   environments is critical for elucidating polar-region ecosystems. Here,
   I report that two strains of the Antarctic basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia
   blollopis exhibited distinct growth characteristics under subzero
   conditions: SK-4 grew efficiently, whereas TKG1-2 did not. I analysed
   the metabolite responses elicited by cold stress in these two M.
   blollopis strains by using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry. M. blollopis SK-4, which grew well under subzero
   temperatures, accumulated high levels of TCA-cycle metabolites, lactic
   acid, aromatic amino acids and polyamines in response to cold shock.
   Polyamines are recognized to function in cell-growth and developmental
   processes, and aromatic amino acids are also known to improve cell
   growth at low temperatures. By contrast, in TKG1-2, which did not grow
   efficiently, cold stress strongly induced the metabolites of the TCA
   cycle, but other metabolites were not highly accumulated in the cell.
   Thus, these differences in metabolite responses could contribute to the
   distinct abilities of SK-4 and TKG1-2 cells to grow under subzero
   temperature conditions.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Amplicon sequencing tools such as metabarcoding are commonly used for
   thorough characterisation of microbial diversity in natural samples.
   They mostly rely on the amplification of conserved universal markers,
   mainly ribosomal genes, allowing the taxonomic assignment of barcodes.
   However, linking taxonomic classification with functional traits is not
   straightforward and requires knowledge of each taxonomic group to
   confidently assign taxa to a given functional trait. Zoosporic parasites
   are highly diverse and yet understudied, with many undescribed species
   and host associations. However, they can have important impacts on host
   populations in natural ecosystems (e.g., controlling harmful algal
   blooms), as well as on industrial-scale algae production, e.g.
   aquaculture, causing their collapse or economic losses. Here, we present
   ParAquaSeq, a curated database of available molecular ribosomal
   sequences belonging to zoosporic parasites infecting aquatic vascular
   plants, macroalgae and photosynthetic microorganisms, i.e. microalgae
   and cyanobacteria. These sequences are aligned with ancillary data and
   other information currently available, including details on their hosts,
   occurrence, culture availability and associated bibliography. The
   database includes 1131 curated sequences from marine, freshwater and
   industrial or artificial environments, and belonging to 13 different
   taxonomic groups, including Chytridiomycota, Oomycota, Phytomyxea, and
   Syndiniophyceae. The curated database will allow a comprehensive
   analysis of zoosporic parasites in molecular datasets to answer
   questions related to their occurrence and distribution in natural
   communities. Especially through meta-analysis, the database serves as a
   valuable tool for developing effective mitigation and sustainable
   management strategies in the algae biomass industry, but it will also
   help to identify knowledge gaps for future research.},

Abstract = {Microbial consortia are a promising alternative to monocultures of
   genetically modified microorganisms for complex biotransformations. We
   developed a versatile consortium-based strategy for the direct
   conversion of lignocellulose to short-chain fatty acids, which included
   the funneling of the lignocellulosic carbohydrates to lactate as a
   central intermediate in engineered food chains. A spatial niche enabled
   in situ cellulolytic enzyme production by an aerobic fungus next to
   facultative anaerobic lactic acid bacteria and the product-forming
   anaerobes. Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Veillonella criceti, or
   Megasphaera elsdenii were integrated into the lactate platform to
   produce 196 kilograms of butyric acid per metric ton of beechwood. The
   lactate platform demonstrates the benefits of mixed cultures, such as
   their modularity and their ability to convert complex substrates into
   valuable biochemicals.},

Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-86},

Note = {Meeting on Biogeomorphology, PLYMOUTH, ENGLAND, JAN, 2001},
Abstract = {The importance of biogeochemical processes in the morphogenic system of
   periglacial environments has been underestimated for decades. Weathering
   rind studies help to characterise and quantify biogeochemical weathering
   over time. Experiments using fungi strains isolated from basaltic
   boulders allow one to decipher biological weathering. A historical
   approach using heterochronous moraines provides the opportunity to
   follow the life of weathering rinds and helps to build a chronology of
   dominant processes of weathering during the first century of exposure.
   It appears that exfoliation of weathering rinds, commonly observed on
   boulders, is the result of a combination of both biogeochemical and
   physical processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {589-596},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although viable fungi have been recovered from a wide variety of icy
   environments, their metabolic capabilities under frozen conditions are
   still largely unknown. We investigated basidiomycetous yeasts isolated
   from an Antarctic ice core and showed that after freezing at a
   relatively slow rate (0.8 degrees C min(-1)), the cells are excluded
   into veins of liquid at the triple junctions of ice crystals. These
   strains were capable of reproductive growth at -5 degrees C under liquid
   conditions. Under frozen conditions, metabolic activity was assessed by
   measuring rates of {[}H-3]leucine incorporation into the acid-insoluble
   macromolecular fraction, which decreased exponentially at temperatures
   between 15 degrees C and -15 degrees C and was inhibited by the protein
   synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Experiments at -5 degrees C under
   frozen and liquid conditions revealed 2-3 orders of magnitude lower
   rates of endogenous metabolism in ice, likely due to the high salinity
   in the liquid fraction of the ice (equivalent of approximate to 1.4 mol
   l(-1) of NaCl at -5 degrees C). The mesophile Saccharomyces cerevisae
   also incorporated {[}H-3]leucine at -5 degrees C and -15 degrees C,
   indicating that this activity is not exclusive to cold-adapted
   microorganisms. The ability of yeast cells to incorporate amino acid
   substrates into macromolecules and remain metabolically active under
   these conditions has implications for understanding the survival of
   Eukarya in icy environments.},

Abstract = {Biodiesel has been regarded as a biodegradable and non-polluting fuel.
   Enzymatic transesterification reaction for manufacturing biodiesel from
   vegetable oils with alcohol is an attractive approach. However, the cost
   of enzyme remains a barrier for its industrial implementation. The aim
   of this research was the screening of lipase-producing microorganisms
   and the studies of potential lipase-mediated biodiesel production using
   palm oil as substrate. A total of 360 strains of bacteria, yeasts and
   fungi were isolated and screened from the samples of oil-contaminated
   soil and waste water. Among all the screened microbes, the potential
   lipolytic bacterium, Staphylococcus warneri, unicellular yeast, Candida
   rugosa and filamentous fungus, Fusarium solani were selected because of
   their high specific activities. The lipase-producing conditions were
   subsequently optimized by using palm oil as an inducer and lipase
   activities were compared for both hydrolytic and synthetic catalysis. C.
   rugosa lipase, which exhibited the highest potential for catalyzing the
   biodiesel production, was further purified and immobilized on various
   hydrophobic supports. The catalysis of transesterification between
   methanol and palm oil by the C. rugosa immobilized lipases revealed that
   immobilized lipase from C. rugosa on Sepabeads EC-OD was the most
   promising for further development as a biocatalyst for the application
   of enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel synthesis.},

Abstract = {Chitinase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds in chitin, holds
   significant potential for industrial applications, including biological
   control, antifungal treatments, and antibiofilm strategies. In this
   study, chitinase derived from Planomicrobium sp. (PP133202) was
   immobilized onto a cobalt metal-organic framework (CoMOF), and its
   properties were extensively analyzed using various biological, chemical,
   and physical characterization techniques. The microbial source was
   identified via 16S rRNA sequencing, and enzyme activity was optimized
   under submerged conditions using Response Surface Methodology (RSM).
   Structural and morphological characterization of the chitinase/Co-MOF
   complex was conducted through FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD, EDX, and surface
   area analyses. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were
   determined to be 42 \% and 20 \%, respectively. Notably, the immobilized
   chitinase exhibited a threefold increase in enzymatic activity compared
   to its free form. Additionally, the chitinase/Co-MOF complex
   demonstrated enhanced biological control efficacy, effectively
   inhibiting Tribolium castaneum and multiple pathogenic microorganisms,
   including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus
   terreus, and Beauveria bassiana. These findings highlight the potential
   of chitinase/Co-MOF as a promising agent for antimicrobial and pest
   control applications.},

Abstract = {This study re-evaluates the classification of the Lulworthiomycetidae
   based on phylogenetic analyses of 18S, 28S and ITS (internal transcribed
   spacers and 5.8S) regions of rDNA and protein coding genes (TEF1 alpha,
   RPB1, RPB2, TUB2, MCM7) along with comprehensive morphological
   comparisons. Based on the current phylogenetic data we consider the
   genus Spathulospora as a member of the Lulworthiales,
   Lulworthiomycetidae, and redundancy of the taxon Spathulosporales. This
   study confirms Lulworthia as polyphyletic with the characteristic
   filiform, long ascospores with an end chamber, which is found in many
   genera: Halazoon, Halophilomyces, Lulwoana, Lulwoidea, Matsusporium,
   Paralulworthia, Paramoleospora, Rostrupiella, and Sammeyersia. These
   genera can be distinguished by morphology, their asexual morphs and
   molecular phylogeny. The Lulworthiomycetidae includes 23 genera and 69
   species. One new genus (Lindriella) and eight new species (Hydea
   mangrovei, Lulworthia norwegica, Matsusporium japonica, Moromyces
   mangrovis, Paralulworthia lignicola, Rostrupiella longispora,
   Sammeyersia yanbuensis, S. thailandica) are introduced, with four new
   combinations.},

Abstract = {A lipase producing strain B1213 isolated from soil was identified as
   Burkholderia pyrrocinia based on 16S rRNA gene and recA sequeence
   analysis, making this the first report on the presence of a lipase from
   B. pyrrocinia. Under an aqueous two-phase purification strategy, which
   included (ATPE)-ion-exchange chromatography (IEC)-gel and filtration
   chromatography (GFC), the specific activity of the 35-kDa lipase was
   determined to be 875.7 U/mg protein. The optimum pH and temperature of
   this lipase was pH 8.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The lipase
   retained > 85\% activity in isopropanol and acetone at 30 degrees C for
   10 mM but the activity was reduced to 10.6\% in n-hexane. Mg2+, Al3+,
   Mn2+, and Fe3+ enhanced lipase activity at both 1 mM and 5 mM
   concentrations. p-NPP, a long-chain acyl group 4-NP ester, appeared to
   be a good substrate candidate.},

Abstract = {During the period of early February to early April of 1995, samples for
   isolation of dictyostelid cellular slime molds were collected from
   representative examples of all major types of plant communities found on
   subantarctic Macquarie Island. These included tussock grassland, short
   grassland, herbfield, fernbrake, mire, and feldmark communities. There
   are apparently no previous reports of dictyostelids from the south polar
   region, but Dictyostelium mucoroides was recovered from soil/litter and/
   or recovered from soil/litter and/or litter samples collected in tussock
   grassland, herbfield, and fernbrake communities. Densities were almost
   invariably low (<50 colony-forming units/g), but one study site yielded
   135 colony-forming units/g. The most diverse plant communities on
   Macquarie are mixed herbfield communities that occur on raised coastal
   terraces, and the majority of positive samples were collected from these
   communities. No dictyostelids were recovered from samples collected at
   higher elevations (generally >200 m) on the main plateau of the island.
   In general, both frequency of occurrence and density were higher for
   samples of moist, decomposing litter found around land sometimes still
   attached to) the bases of such plants as Pleurophyllum hookeri and
   Stilbocarpa polaris than for samples collected from the soil/litter

Title = {Outdoor climate drives diversity patterns of dominant microbial taxa in
   caves worldwide},

Abstract = {The cave microbiota is assumed to be shaped by indoor microclimate,
   biotic and abiotic factors, which are largely dependent from outside
   environmental conditions; however, this knowledge is available at local
   or regional scales only. To address this knowledge gap, we reanalyzed
   over 1050 bacterial and fungal communities of caves worldwide, and found
   that outdoor temperature and rainfall play a critical role in explaining
   differences in microbial diversity patterns of global caves, selecting
   specific dominant taxa across gradients of growing aridity conditions
   with arid climate leading to a reduction in total cave microbial
   diversity. Moreover, we found that fungal (from 186 to 1908 taxa) and
   bacterial (from 467 to 1619 taxa) diversity increased under
   temperate-tropical and temperate-continental climatic regions,
   respectively, highlighting an opposite preference for the two microbial
   compartments. We hypothesized that outdoor geographical, climatic
   variables and lithology are critical epistatic drivers in assembling
   microbial communities and their dominant taxa, whose ecological
   responses could be useful to predict the fate of these subterranean
   environments in the context of climate change. Our work elucidates the
   intimate connection between caves microbiota and surface ecosystems
   highlighting the sensitivity of cave microbial communities to climatic
   changes and environmental degradation. This work also provides a natural
   benchmark for the biogeographic information for caves globally and for
   protection strategies aiming at conservation of underground
   environments.},

Abstract = {Background A key component of achieving universal health coverage is
   ensuring that all populations have access to quality health care.
   Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and
   within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for
   future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and
   Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access
   and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195
   countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven
   countries, from 1990 to 2016.
   Methods Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD
   2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the
   presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access
   and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential
   effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk
   factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to
   non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of
   environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure.
   Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used
   mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised
   death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal
   health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to
   a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed
   between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set
   these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to
   subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to
   construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an
   overall score of 0-100 of personal health-care access and quality by
   location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by
   quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of
   overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other
   data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index
   scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health
   spending per capita.
   Findings In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97.1
   (95\% UI 95.8-98.1) in Iceland, followed by 96.6 (94.9-97.9) in Norway
   and 96.1 (94.5-97.3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18.6
   (13.1-24.4) in the Central African Republic, 19.0 (14.3-23.7) in
   Somalia, and 23.4 (20.2-26.8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress
   achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements
   occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa
   and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and
   elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances
   in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities
   emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India
   having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and
   lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91.5 (89.1-936)
   in Beijing to 48.0 (43.4-53.2) in Tibet (a 43.5-point difference), while
   India saw a 30.8-point disparity, from 64.8 (59.6-68.8) in Goa to 34.0
   (30.3-38.1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational
   HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4.8-point difference), whereas differences
   between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index
   values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as
   high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat
   narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20.9-point to 17.0-point difference),
   whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during
   this time (a 17.2-point to 20.4-point difference). Performance on the
   HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and
   high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster
   gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the
   development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service
   areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases.
   Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated
   with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as
   health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous,
   particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.
   Interpretation GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past
   success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access
   and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many
   low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless
   heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to
   and quality of health care across key health services, especially
   non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements
   experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could
   reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary
   health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium
   Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health
   programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage upon improving both
   access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more
   comprehensive view and subsequent provision of quality health care for
   all populations. Copyright (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Document recommendation systems for locating relevant literature have
   mostly relied on methods developed a decade ago. This is largely due to
   the lack of a large offline gold-standard benchmark of relevant
   documents that cover a variety of research fields such that newly
   developed literature search techniques can be compared, improved and
   translated into practice. To overcome this bottleneck, we have
   established the RElevant LIterature SearcH consortium consisting of more
   than 1500 scientists from 84 countries, who have collectively annotated
   the relevance of over 180 000 PubMed-listed articles with regard to
   their respective seed (input) article/s. The majority of annotations
   were contributed by highly experienced, original authors of the seed
   articles. The collected data cover 76\% of all unique PubMed Medical
   Subject Headings descriptors. No systematic biases were observed across
   different experience levels, research fields or time spent on
   annotations. More importantly, annotations of the same document pairs
   contributed by different scientists were highly concordant. We further
   show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate
   recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term
   Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had
   similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods
   each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles,
   suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture
   all relevant articles. The established database server located at
   https://relishdb.ict.griffith.edu.au is freely available for the
   downloading of annotation data and the blind testing of new methods. We
   expect that this benchmark will be useful for stimulating the
   development of new powerful techniques for title and
   title/abstract-based search engines for relevant articles in biomedical
   research.},
