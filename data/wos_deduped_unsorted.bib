  ABSTRACT = {We present the first study on the quantity and diversity of the mycobiota in bottom sediments of the Chukchi Sea. During implementation of the RUSALCA-2012 program, 22 samples of bottom sediments from depths of 44-110 m were collected in late August-early September 2012. Fungi were isolated on agarized media (salinity 35 psu, temperature 6 degrees C). Species identification was performed by morphological-cultural and molecular-genetic methods based on the nucleotide sequences of ITS1-ITS2 rDNA. A total of 128 colonies of mycelial fungi were isolated; 0 to 22 propagules were obtained from each 1 cm(3) sample. The overall diversity was represented by 48 morphotypes belonging to 32 genera in 15 orders of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. Ascomycetes predominated both in number and diversity. A number of species were found in marine ecosystems for the first time. The taxonomic position of nonsporulating isolates (13\% of the total) was established using molecular techniques. Among them, high diversity was observed in the orders Pleosporales and Helotiales (Ascomycota).},

  ABSTRACT = {This is the first report on abundance and diversity of cultured filamentous fungi and on abundance of yeasts in the sediments of the Laptev and East Siberian seas. A total of 63 isolates of filamentous fungi belonging to 32 morphotypes were obtained from 35 sediment samples. Most morphotypes were represented by single colonies in individual samples; the most frequently occurring species were Pseudeurotiumzonatum, Pseudogymnoascuspannorum, and Cordycepsfarinos \& acy;. In both seas, the abundance of filamentous fungi (up to 12 colonies per 1 g wet sediment) was lower than that of yeasts (up to 68 colonies per 1 g wet sediment). In the Laptev Sea, yeast abundance was low at all stations, while in the East Siberian Sea higher values were found at near-estuarine stations.},

  TITLE = {Bird feather fungi from Svalbard Arctic},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {39},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {Despite feather fungi being an important component of the Arctic fungal flora, their ecological role and diversity are not fully known. In the current study, fungal cultures were isolated from feathers (barnacle goose, common eider, and glaucous gull) collected in the Ny-lesund region, Svalbard. Isolates were identified by ITS region sequences, which include the ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S rRNA. The result showed culturable yeast and filamentous fungi belonging to three classes: Ascomycota (Pyrenochaetopsis pratorum, Cladosporium herbarum, Thelebolus microsporus, Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium commune, and Venturia sp.), Basidiomycota (Mrakia blollopis and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa), and Zygomycota (Mucor flavus). Most of the fungal isolates appeared to be cold-tolerant, and about 60 \% of the isolates showed keratinase activity. The reasonably low fungal diversity colonizing feathers indicates that the birds of Svalbard are casual carriers of fungi which may result in a negligible impact on their health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of fungal communities present on the feathers of birds in the high Arctic.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {59},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Two strains of a psychrophilic basidiomycetous yeast species belonging to the genus Mrakia were isolated from a melt-pool mat community, on an ice island located in Disraeli Fjord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. Analysis of the large subunit rDNA D1/D2 domain and internal transcribed spacer region sequences indicated that these strains represent a novel species, and the name Mrakia arctica sp. nov. is proposed. This new species could grow at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free media. Moreover, lipase and cellulase enzymes of M. arctica were strongly active even at -3 degrees C. These results suggest an important role for M. arctica in the biogeochemical cycle of glacial ecosystems. (C) 2017 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fungi are widely distributed on our planet, including in extremely harsh habitats, such as the polar regions. The extreme conditions of those habitats limit the number of organisms capable of living there, but some fungi are adapted to the polar conditions and play essential roles in nutrient cycling. However, knowledge about their diversity, distribution, and functioning is fragmented, and approaches used to study them are diverse, often yielding difficult-to-compare results. We present maps with locations of mycological studies in the Arctic and Antarctica, as well as a list of mycelial fungi found on various terrestrial substrates through cultivation on nutrient media and/or molecular methods. These fungi were identified to the species level based on morphological-cultural features or gene-sequence analysis. Analysis of the methods applied to study fungi in different substrates shows that a combination of multiple methods is optimal to study species composition. The taxonomic affiliation of the identified species to different fungal divisions is largely determined by habitat conditions and research methods. The largest number of species belongs to the divisions Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The predominant ecological groups were saprotrophic and symbiotic fungi. The majority of 1324 discovered fungal species are known as cosmopolitan species. Approximately one-fifth of the fungi were identical between the Arctic and Antarctica, only a few species are known to be endemic to Antarctica or Arctic, and there are 1-6 identified bipolar species. Claims of endemism of polar-region fungi are relatively weakly supported.},

  ABSTRACT = {The basidiomycetous yeast, Glaciozyma antarctica, was isolated from various terrestrial materials collected from the Soya coast, East Antarctica, and formed frost-columnar colonies on agar plates frozen at -1 degrees C. Thawed colonies were highly viscous, indicating that the yeast produced a large number of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). G. antarctica was then cultured on frozen media containing red food coloring to observe the dynamics of solutes in unfrozen water; pigments accumulated in frozen yeast colonies, indicating that solutes were concentrated in unfrozen water of yeast colonies. Moreover, the yeast produced a small quantity of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) which inhibited ice crystal growth. Solutes in unfrozen water were considered to accumulate in the pore of frozen colonies. The extracellular IBPs may have held an unfrozen state of medium water after accumulation in the frost-columnar colony.},

Of the 197 plant-root systems and soil rhizospheres examined, 28\% were associated with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Roots of both F: brachyphylla and F: baffinensis were colonized, while none were detected in F. hyperborea root specimens. Five arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species were extracted from indigenous soils. The most frequent and abundant species was Glomus mosseae (Nicol. \& Gerd.) Gerdemann \& Trappe, which was isolated from 8 of the 13 sites sampled. Other Glomales species in Arctic soils were Glomus macrocarpum Tul \& Tul., Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxter sensu Gerd.) Gerd. \& Trappe emend. Walker \& Koske, and two other unidentified Glomus species. Trap cultures of the indigenous soil with leek (Allium porrum L.) plants confirmed the identity of the species previously identified from original soil and allowed the detection of an additional species, Glomus aggregatum Schenck. \& Smith. The novelty of these observations and the relationship between plant mycorrhizal status, fungal species, and soil disturbance are discussed.},

  TITLE = {Phosphate solubilization by filamentous fungi from Antarctic lichens and sediments},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {29},
  YEAR = {2025},
  ABSTRACT = {We aimed to investigate the phosphate solubilization by filamentous fungi isolated from Antarctic lichen and sediment. The results yielded a total of 80 strains, 9 of which were positive for phosphate solubilization in solid NBRIP medium. Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 and Penicillium steckii 5Y.P4 showed the largest halos, indicating their potential in phosphate solubilization. Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 was the most efficient phosphorus (P) solubilizer with maximum P levels of 106.14 mg/L at 15 degrees C and 80.89 mg/L at 25 degrees C. This strain also showed solubilization activity at 0.5 M NaCl with P levels of 127.93 mg/L. At pH 8.0, the P content was 137.93 mg/L, and glucose was the best carbon source (P 146.55 mg/L). Moreover, the isolated fungus showed activity only with tricalcium phosphate as an inorganic phosphate source. During the solubilization process, Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 released formic, malic, and succinic acids by the 15th day of incubation (P 208.99 mg/L). These findings indicate that Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 from Antarctic sediment has the potential to solubilize phosphate and thus unveils new possibilities for the agricultural sector, aimed to reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {93},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {The effect of hydrocarbon pollution on the fungal communities of littoral sediments of the cold-water White and Barents seas was investigated. The samples were collected at locations with different levels of pollution with oil products, from ports to relatively undisturbed areas. Using the diesel fuel-containing medium resulted in detection of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi in almost all studied samples, although in all cases they were less diverse than sugar-degrading fungi. In this relatively small group, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium brevicompactum were the most common organisms. Fungal communities isolated on a sugar-containing medium exhibited higher diversity and abundance, with being the most common sugar degraders. The major factors affecting the structure of the fungal communities were the percentage of hydrocarbons in the total mass of organic carbon in the samples in the case of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi and location, for sugar degraders. In the experiment, the highest hydrocarbon-degrading activity was shown for Penicillium chrysogenum (the loss of residual hydrocarbons was 77.4\%), Cadophora fastigiata (72\%), and Tolypocladium inflatum (67.2\%).},

  TITLE = {Nitrate is an important nitrogen source for Arctic tundra plants},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {115},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Plant nitrogen (N) use is a key component of the N cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. The supply of N to plants affects community species composition and ecosystem processes such as photo-synthesis and carbon (C) accumulation. However, the availabilities and relative importance of different N forms to plants are not well understood. While nitrate (NO3-) is a major N form used by plants worldwide, it is discounted as a N source for Arctic tundra plants because of extremely low NO3- concentrations in Arctic tundra soils, undetectable soil nitrification, and plant-tissue NO3- that is typically below detection limits. Here we reexamine NO3- use by tundra plants using a sensitive denitrifier method to analyze plant-tissue NO3-. Soil-derived NO3- was detected in tundra plant tissues, and tundra plants took up soil NO3- at comparable rates to plants from relatively NO3--rich ecosystems in other biomes. Nitrate assimilation determined by N-15 enrichments of leaf NO3- relative to soil NO3- accounted for 4 to 52\% (as estimated by a Bayesian isotope-mixing model) of species-specific total leaf N of Alaskan tundra plants. Our finding that in situ soil NO3- availability for tundra plants is high has important implications for Arctic ecosystems, not only in determining species compositions, but also in determining the loss of N from soils via leaching and denitrification. Plant N uptake and soil N losses can strongly influence C uptake and accumulation in tundra soils. Accordingly, this evidence of NO3- availability in tundra soils is crucial for predicting C storage in tundra.},

This system also allowed the isolation of typical soil yeasts from Colorado {[}USA] soils and of cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, filamentous fungi and chlorophyta. Marked inhibitory effects of conventional yeast media account for the failure of previous investigators to isolate these Antarctic yeasts. Their abundance remains unknown, since E-1 and 2 MC also have some inhibitory effects.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two new decalin-tetramic acid compounds, iqalisetin A (1) and iqalisetin B (2), were identified from a Tolypocladium sp. isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from Frobisher Bay, Nunavut, in Canada's arctic. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by NMR experiments. The relative stereochemistry of the decalin skeleton was determined by NOESY experiments and confirmed that 1 and 2 contained a trans-decalin ring system. The absolute stereochemistry of the tetramic acid was determined using Marfey's method. Compounds 1 and 2 did not exhibit any significant antimicrobial or cytotoxic activity.},

  TITLE = {Factors affecting water availability for high Arctic lichens},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {40},
  YEAR = {2017},
  ABSTRACT = {Lichen symbiosis is a successful nutritional strategy that drives lichen distributions in high Arctic ecosystems. However, the in situ effects of fungal partners (mycobionts) on water availability for the photosynthetic partners (photobionts) and their necessity for survival remain unclear. We investigated the factors creating differences in water availability in high Arctic lichen assemblages using observational and experimental analyses of substrates and thallus morphology in the high Arctic, near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (79 degrees N) during the snow-free season. We used five lichen species found on five substrate types: moss litter, vascular plant litter, mixed litter, biological soil crust (BSC) and gravel. BSC had significantly higher water content than the other substrates; although it had high levels of surface evaporation, BSC took up more ground water. Moreover, the structure of BSC supported greater water retention than the four other substrates in our study, providing the moistest environment for lichens. In fact, 60 \% of the surface area of the crustose lichen Ochrolechia frigida, which was mainly distributed on BSC, was in contact with the substrate. In contrast, the four fruticose lichens had larger surface areas than Och frig and roughly 90 \% air exposure. Initial rates of absorption and evaporation increased with greater thallus surface area, suggesting that water availability for photobionts is strongly affected by both morphological characteristics and substrate water properties, both of which depend on mycobionts. We conclude that lichens show preferences for both morphologies and substrates that promote autotrophic nutrition in the water-limited glacier foreland of the high Arctic region.},

  ABSTRACT = {The total of 98 strains of moulds were isolated from soils collected in arctic tundra (Spitzbergen). Among these strains Penicillium cyclopium 1, the most effective for production of catalase, was selected by the method of test-tube microculture. The time course of growth and catalase production by this strain showed the intracellular activity of this enzyme to be about 3-fold higher than its extracellular level. Some properties of crude catalase preparation, isolated from postculture liquids by lyophilization, were also examined. Catalase activity showed its maximum at 15 degreesC, indicating adaptation of the enzyme to lower temperatures of the arctic environment.},

  VOLUME = {51},
  YEAR = {2004},
  ABSTRACT = {The recovery of culturable microorganisms from ancient materials, ranging from a few thousand to several million years old, has generated interest in the long-term survival capabilities of micrororganisms. We report the occurrence of such paleobes for the first time from a deep-sea sediment core obtained from a depth of 5904 m from the Chagos trench in the Indian Ocean. Culturable fungi, direct counts of bacteria, age of the sediments based on the radiolarian assemblage, total organic carbon, Eh and CaCO3 were determined in these sediments. Culturable fungi were obtained from subsections up to 370 cm depth. The age of the sediments from which fungi were isolated was estimated to range from>0.18 to 0.43 million years (Ma), being the oldest recorded age for recovery of culturable fungi. Colony forming units of fungi ranged from 69 to 2493 g(-1) dry weight sediment with a maximum abundance recorded at 160 cm depth of the core, corresponding to similar to0.18 Ma. Bacterial numbers in the core showed oscillations corresponding to cycles of approximately 100 ka (kilo years). The fungi comprised non-sporulating forms and a sporulating form identified to be Aspergillus sydowii. Germination of spores of A. sydowii at 100, 300 and 500 bar hydrostatic pressures at 5 degreesC confirmed its barotolerance and its nativity to deep-sea sediments. We propose that deep-sea sediments are a source of paleobes, which could be useful in studies on palaeoclimate, long-term microbial survival and biotechnology. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {31},
  YEAR = {2012},
  ABSTRACT = {Fifty-six fungal isolates from Arctic soils were subjected to primary screening for their ability to solubilize insoluble inorganic phosphate. Nine of the isolates were further analysed quantitatively for phosphatase production using para-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate. Amongst these, a cold-tolerant fungus, Penicillium citrinum strain PG162 was found to be the best producer of intracellular acid phosphatase. Further characterization of the enzyme showed that it is most active in the temperature range of 40-60 degrees C and pH range of 4.2-4.8. The dried enzyme extract is stable at a temperature of up to 50 degrees C for at least 1 h. Its activity is affected by presence of metal ions. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis suggests the molecular weight of the enzyme to be between 20 and 29 kDa. The present study is important with respect to our understanding of the kind of enzymatic reactions that take place in the polar microbes, and the extent to which their activity is sustained.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {20},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {Endolichenic fungi within 17 lichen species in the area near Ny-lesund (Svalbard, High Arctic) were studied by a culture-based method. The 247 fungal isolates were obtained from 2712 lichen thallus segments. The colonization rate of endolichenic fungi ranged from 1.6 to 26.5 \%, respectively. These isolates were identified to 40 fungal taxa, including 35 Ascomycota (10 orders), 4 Basidiomycota (3 orders), and 1 unidentified fungus. Thelebolales was the most abundant order, while Sordariales were the most diverse order. The common fungal taxa shared by more than 3 lichen species were Thelebolus microsporus (93 isolates), Coniochaeta hoffmannii (7 isolates), Sarocladium kiliense (33 isolates), Coniochaeta sp. 1 (5 isolates), Coniochaeta sp. 4 (28 isolates), and Coniochaeta sp. 2 (5 isolates). Low Sorenson's similarity coefficients were observed among different lichen species, indicating that host-related factor may shape the endolichenic fungal communities in this region. In addition, no endolichenic fungal taxa were previously found in the Antarctica and Austrian Alps, suggesting endolichenic fungal communities in this region might be also shaped by the Arctic climate. The results demonstrate the existence of specific cultured endolichenic fungal species, which may be suitable objects for further study of their possible functional roles in the lichen thalli.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {28},
  YEAR = {2001},
  ABSTRACT = {2,000 microbial strains were isolated from soil samples and tested to determine their lipolytic activity by employing screening techniques on solid and in liquid media. Culture broths were initially tested with 1,2-O-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid-resorufinyl ester, a chromogenic substrate specific for lipases. Fourteen lipase-producing microorganisms were selected and their taxonomic identification was carried out. Hydrolysis of tributyrin or olive oil and the esterification of oleic acid with heptanol were selected to preliminary evaluate the catalytic activity of these lipases. All the selected lipases catalysed this esterification reaction with good yields. Resolution of (R,S)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid, (R,S)-1-phenylethanol, (R,S) 1-phenylethylamine and of (R) or (S) glycidol were performed to evaluate the stereoselectivity of these novel enzymes as biocatalysts in reactions in organic media. Lipases from the fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Ovadendron sulphureo-ochraceum gave the best yields and enantioselectivities in the resolution of racemic ibuprofen and 1-phenylethanol, Several lipases displayed a high stereoselectivity in the resolution of chiral amines by an alcoxycarbonylation reaction.

  TITLE = {Filamentous Soil Fungi from Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen, and Screening for Extracellular Enzymes},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {65},
  YEAR = {2012},
  ABSTRACT = {Soil filamentous fungi from Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen, were studied. A total of 30 fungal isolates were identified by morpho-taxonomy, and the identity of some morpho-taxonomically complex isolates was authenticated by ITS1-5.8S and ITS2 rDNA domain sequence similarity. The isolates belonged to 19 species under 14 genera (Acremonium, Arthrinium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Corynespora, Emericella, Geomyces, Mortierella, Mucor, Myrothecium, Penicillium, Phialophora, Preussia, Xylaria). To the best of our knowledge, Acremonium roseolum, Aspergillus aculeatus, Emericella nidulans, and Preussia sp. are the first northernmost records from Arctic soils. The viable fungal count in different soil samples varied from 0.5 x 10(4) to 2.0 x 10(5) g(-1). Species richness in different soil samples was also calculated. Mortierella was one of the most dominant genera in Arctic soils. A temperature tolerance study was carried out for all the isolates, and representative species were screened for their extracellular enzyme activity (amylase, cellulase, phosphatase, and pectinase) at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Among the 30 isolates, seven showed cellulolytic activity, two were phosphate solubilizers, three had amylolytic activity, and only one showed pectinolytic activity on solid media. CMCase (beta 1, 4-endoglucanase) activity was quantified in seven isolates that exhibited positive activity during preliminary screening. The records of enzyme activity for amylases, pectinases, and cellulases are the first from the fungi of Spitsbergen. The present study indicates the dominance in Ny-Alesund of cellulolytic strains, which may serve as potent decomposers in Arctic tundra. These isolates may be used to facilitate the mineralization of cellulolytic wastes generated by human activities in colder hilly areas across the world, including the Himalayas in India.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {19},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {Antarctica's extreme environment and geographical isolation offers a useful platform for testing the relative roles of environmental selection and dispersal barriers influencing fungal communities. The former process should lead to convergence in community composition with other cold environments, such as those in the Arctic. Alternatively, dispersal limitations should minimise similarity between Antarctica and distant northern landmasses. Using high-throughput sequencing, we show that Antarctica shares significantly more fungi with the Arctic, and more fungi display a bipolar distribution, than would be expected in the absence of environmental filtering. In contrast to temperate and tropical regions, there is relatively little endemism, and a strongly bimodal distribution of range sizes. Increasing southerly latitude is associated with lower endemism and communities increasingly dominated by fungi with widespread ranges. These results suggest that microorganisms with well-developed dispersal capabilities can inhabit opposite poles of the Earth, and dominate extreme environments over specialised local species.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {67},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {A unicellular, heterotrophic, eukaryotic parasite was isolated from nearshore Arctic marine sediment in association with the diatom Pleurosigma sp. The parasite possessed ectoplasmic threads that could penetrate diatom frustules. Healthy and reproducing Pleurosigma cultures would begin to collapse within a week following the introduction of this parasite. The parasite (2-10 mu m diameter) could reproduce epibiotically with biflagellate zoospores, as well as binary division inside and outside the diatom host. While the parasite grew, diatom intracellular content disappeared. Evaluation of electron micrographs from co-cultures revealed the presence of hollow tubular processes and amorphic cells that could transcend the diatom frustule, generally at the girdle band, as well as typical thraustochytrid ultrastructure, such as the presence of bothrosomes. After nucleotide extraction, amplification, and cloning, database queries of DNA revealed closest molecular affinity to environmental thraustochytrid clone sequences. Testing of phylogenetic hypotheses consistently grouped this unknown parasite within the Thraustochytriidae on a distinct branch within the environmental sequence clade Lab19. Reclassification of Arctic high-throughput sequencing data, with appended reference datasets that included this diatom parasite, indicated that the majority of thraustochytrid sequences, previously binned as unclassifiable stramenopiles, are allied to this new isolate. Based on the combined information acquired from electron microscopy, life history, and phylogenetic testing, this unknown isolate is described as a novel species and genus.},

  ABSTRACT = {Cold active extracellular hydrolytic enzymes produced by different groups of bacteria are a valuable source for biotechnological applications and for gathering knowledge about the eco-physiological role of these microbes in their habitat. Ny-angstrom lesund of Arctic region is one of the northernmost polar area of our world. In order to understand the geo-microbiological features of this unexplored habitat, a total of 51 heterotrophic bacterial isolates were isolated from Ny-angstrom lesund soil sample. More than 74\% (38 isolates) of the isolates showed significant extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity, such as amylase, protease, lipase, DNase, phosphatase etc. Combined hydrolytic degradation have been detected in a number of isolates. The best producers were identified on the basis of 16s rRNA gene Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic distribution of the identified strains shows high presence (71\%) of gamma-Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas sp.; Acinetobacter sp.) in the sample. Two other genera Paenibacillus and Planococcus were also identified.},

  ABSTRACT = {Eleven Fusarium species were isolated from 22 of 37 soil samples collected from 37 sites in Norway from grassy areas; 33 samples were near the Arctic Circle (61-68.degree. N). Fusarium oxysporum was abundant at 17 sites; F. merismoides at six sites; F. moniliforme at five sites; and F. acuminatum, F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. equiseti, F. proliferatum, F. sambucinum, F. semitectum, and F. solani were identified at 1-4 sites. Fusarium merismoides was found only in the most northern latitudes (65.degree.50''-68.degree.18''N). Three of the four isolates of F. moniliforme and 36 of 37 isolates of F. oxysporum tested for toxigenicity caused weight losses, hematuria and hemorrhage of tissues, and death of rats when rats were fed a rice medium in which Fusarium species were cultured Fusarium merismoides was not lethal but caused substantial weight losses to rats in the 5-day test period.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {34},
  YEAR = {2013},
  ABSTRACT = {We assessed culturable soil microfungal diversity in various habitats around Hornsund, Spitsbergen in the High Arctic, using potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. Thermal growth classification of the fungi obtained was determined by incubating them in 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C, permitting separation of those with psychrophilic, psychrotolerant and mesophilic characteristics. In total, 68 fungal isolates were obtained from 12 soil samples, and grouped into 38 mycelial morphotypes. Intergenic spacer regions of these morphotypes were sequenced, and they represented 25 distinct taxonomic units, of which 21 showed sufficient similarity with available sequence data in NCBI to be identified to species level. Soil under ornithogenic influence showed the highest species diversity, including sequences assigned to Mortierella macrocystis, M. elongata, Mortierella sp., Cudoniella sp., Varicosporium elodeae, Beauveria bassiana, Geomyces pannorum, Penicillium sp. and Atradidymella muscivora. Fourteen taxa were classified as psychrophilic, seven mesophilic, and four psychrotolerant.},

  ABSTRACT = {The composition of the terrestrial Antarctic flora and fauna and the distribution patterns of a number of species and of the principal vegetation types is now reasonably well established, at least in outline, for the Antarctic Peninsula region and the areas about McMurdo Sound as well as for some areas around the coastal ranges of East Antarctica. Detailed research at Signy Island has provided information concerning thebiomass and productivity of certain vegetation types, decomposer organisms, microbivores, and invertebrate herbivores and predators. The main pathways of energy and nutrient within the terrestrial study sites can be regarded as reasonably established. Net annual production locally reaches very high levels (up to 800 g m-2). Only a tiny part of this productivity is consumed by herbivores, the greater part passing to the decomposers or persisting as peat. Most of the animals are microbivores, or graze on fungi, and in turn sustain the small number of invertebrate predators. Analysis of the range of habitats even on Signy Island indicates however that the sites for which detailed ecological information is available represent only a part of the range of environmental and ecological variation. The island is characterized by a very high level of within-site diversity, some of it on a very small scale. Similarly, recent research which permits ecological comparisons with the Subantarctic islands of South Georgia and Macquarie, and with the McMurdo area, confirms that Signy Island displays only a small part of the very large range of diversity within the antarctic regions as a whole. It is a reasonably representative sample of the Maritime Antarctic zone in the Antarctic Peninsula region where conditions are particularly favorable for terrestrial life. Its ecological features resemble most closely those of the South Shetland Islands (except over permeable volcanic rocks) and the Palmer Archipelago on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. Very different plant and animal communities occur over much of the McMurdo Sound region and in the inland ranges of East Antarctica. Some general statements can now be made about the relationships between terrestrial antarctic eco-systems and climatic, edaphic and historical factors. There is a clearly marked attenuation of the vegetation and fauna and simplification of the ecological systems as one moves towards cold, arid continental conditions. But the biota of the Maritime Antarctic and the Subantarctic islands is more impoverished than ecological factors alone would indicate because of the isolation of these land habitats, many of which have only recently been deglaciated. If present environmental conditions persist, a slow increase in the complexity of these ecological systems is to be expected and in some areas, especially the subantarctic islands, this process is being accelerated by human influence.},

  YEAR = {1998},
  ABSTRACT = {Acid phosphatase production by 12 Hebeloma strains was usually derepressed when inorganic phosphorus in the growth medium was limited, but appeared to be constitutive in some strains. At low temperatures(less than or equal to 12 degrees) arctic strains produced more extracellular and wall-bound acid phosphatase, yet grew more slowly than the temperate strains. We suggest that low growth rates in arctic strains may be a physiological response to cold whereby resources are diverted into carbohydrate accumulation for cryoprotection. At near freezing temperatures, increased extracellular phosphatase production may compensate for a loss of enzyme activity at low temperature and serve to hydrolyse organic phosphorus in frozen soil over winter.},

  ABSTRACT = {Atmospheric sounding using the Tu-134 Optik aircraft-laboratory was conducted in September 2020 over the seas of the Russian sector of the Arctic Ocean, namely the Barents, Kara, Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi and Bering seas. Unique samples of atmospheric aerosols at altitudes from 200 and up to 10,000 m were taken, including samples for the identification of cultivated microorganisms and their genetic analysis. Data on the concentration and diversity of bacteria and fungi isolated from 24 samples of atmospheric aerosols are presented; the main phenotypic and genomic characteristics were obtained for 152 bacterial cultures; and taxonomic belonging was determined. The concentration of cultured microorganisms detected in aerosols of different locations was similar, averaging 5.5 x 103 CFU/m3. No dependence of the number of isolated microorganisms on the height and location of aerosol sampling was observed. The presence of pathogenic and condto shitionally pathogenic bacteria, including those referred to in the genera Staphylococcus, Kocuria, Rothia, Comamonas, Brevundimonas, Acinetobacter, and others, as well as fungi represented by the widely spread genera Aureobasidium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Penicillium, capable of causing infectious and allergic diseases were present in most analyzed samples. Obtained data reveal the necessity of systematic studies of atmospheric microbiota composition to combat emerging population diseases.},

  ABSTRACT = {Aims Competition has been shown to modify the niche breadth of coexisting species, but within-species interactions have received little attention. Establishing small juvenile individuals and established, larger, sexually reproducing adult individuals represent two life-history stages within species. We investigated the nitrogen and carbon resource use of adult and juvenile individuals and similarity of symbiotic fungal community composition in these two plant life stages. We used the plant Solidago virgaurea growing in a simplified system in the low Arctic as model species. Methods Isotopic signatures (foliar delta N-15 and foliar delta C-13) were analysed to characterize nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency of the plants. Symbiotic root fungal community composition was estimated by cloning and sequencing small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Important Findings The isotopic signatures differed significantly between the life stages, indicating that the establishing juvenile cohort used relatively more amino acids or gained N through mycorrhizal symbiosis in comparison to the established adult plants. Symbiotic fungal communities did not differ between the two plant cohorts suggesting a possibility that the plants shared the same mycorrhizal network. We conclude that competition-mediated differences in plant resource use may create niche differentiation between the two life-history stages and enable them to coexist.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {10},
  YEAR = {2014},
  ABSTRACT = {The 318m thick lacustrine sediment record from Lake El'gygytgyn, northeastern Russian Arctic cored by the international El'gygytgyn Drilling Project provides unique opportunities for the time-continuous reconstruction of the regional paleoenvironmental history for the past 3.6 Myr. Pollen studies of the lower 216 m of the lacustrine sediments demonstrate their value as an excellent archive of vegetation and climate changes during the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. About 3.5-3.35 Myr BP, the vegetation at Lake El'gygytgyn, now an area of tundra was dominated by spruce-larch-fir-hemlock forests. After ca. 3.35 Myr BP dark coniferous taxa gradually disappeared. A very pronounced environmental change took place ca. 3.31-3.28 Myr BP, corresponding to the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2, when treeless tundra-and steppe-like habitats became dominant in the regional vegetation. Climate conditions were similar to those of Late Pleistocene cold intervals. Numerous coprophilous fungi spores identified in the pollen samples suggest the presence of grazing animals around the lake. Following the MIS M2 event, larch-pine forests with some spruce mostly dominated the area until ca. 2.6 Myr BP, interrupted by colder and drier intervals ca. 3.043-3.025, 2.935-2.912, and 2.719-2.698 Myr BP. At the beginning of the Pleistocene, ca. 2.6 Myr BP, noticeable climatic deterioration occurred. Forested habitats changed to predominantly treeless and shrubby environments, which reflect a relatively cold and dry climate. Peaks in observed green algae colonies (Botryococcus) around 2.53, 2.45, 2.32-2.305, 2.20 and 2.16-2.15 Myr BP suggest a spread of shallow water environments. A few intervals (i.e., 2.55-2.53, ca. 2.37, and 2.35-2.32 Myr BP) with a higher presence of coniferous taxa (mostly pine and larch) document some relatively short-term climate ameliorations during Early Pleistocene glacial periods.},

  ABSTRACT = {Comparative characterization of Geomyces isolates was performed. The isolates were obtained from Arctic cryopegs and the surrounding ancient marine deposits, from nonsaline permafrost soils, and from temperate environments. Microbiological (cultural and morphological) and molecular criteria were used to confirm the identification of the isolates as Geomyces pannorum. The isolates from cryopegs and surrounding marine deposits were shown to differ from those obtained from nonsaline soils and temperate environments in their ability to grow at negative temperatures (-2 degrees C) under increased salt concentration (10\%). The results are discussed in relation to the possible inheritance of the adaptive characteristics acquired in specific environments.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {48},
  YEAR = {2012},
  ABSTRACT = {Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a common pathogen in domestic ruminants that causes granulomatous inflammation of the small intestine leading to emaciation and wasting. Clinical disease (Johne's disease) is also reported for several wild ruminant species. Between 2007 and 2009 we collected 561 fecal samples from caribou (Rangifer tarandus ssp.) representing 10 herds of migratory caribou, two herds of caribou from Greenland, and three populations of boreal woodland caribou. Feces were tested for MAP by bacterial culture and PCR targeting the IS900 insertion sequence. In total, 31 samples from eight different populations representing all three ecotypes were found positive for MAP by PCR, with one sample from the Riviere-aux-Feuilles herd also being culture positive for the type II (cattle) strain. The proportion of positive animals was particularly high in the Akia-Maniitsoq herd in Greenland, and Riviere-aux-Feuilles and Riviere-George herds in northeastern Canada (2:3.4, 11..5, and 10.0\%, respectively). Our results indicate that MAP is present in several caribou herds of different ecotypes in northern Canada and Greenland and that MAP circulates within wildlife populations that do not have ongoing contact with domestic livestock. The epidemiology, pathogenicity, and effects on the health of caribou in northern ecosystems remain unknown.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {255},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {The Deception Island, located in Maritime Antarctica, is a volcanic island with geothermal activity and one of the most visited by tourists. However, the extent of the anthropogenic impact remains largely unknown and the factors shaping the resistance/tolerance mechanisms in the microbiomes from Whalers Bay ecosystems have never been investigated. In this context, this study aimed to reveal the resistome profiles of Whalers Bay sediments and correlate them with environmental factors. Samples were collected at four sites during the summer 2014/2015 along a transect of 27.5 m in the Whalers Bay sediments. DNA isolated from sediment samples was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Bioinformatic analyses allowed the assembly of contigs and scaffolds, prediction of ORFs, and taxonomic and functional annotation using NCBI RefSeq database and KEGG orthology, respectively. Microorganisms belonging to the genera Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium and Polaromonas were shown to dominate all sites, representing 60\% of taxonomic annotation. Arsenic (As), copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) were the most abundant metal resistance/tolerance types found in the microbiomes. Beta-lactam was the most common class related to antibiotics resistance/tolerance, corroborating with previous environmental resistome studies. The acridine class was the most abundant amongst the biocide resistance/tolerances, related to antiseptic compounds. Results gathered in this study reveal a repertoire of resistance/tolerance classes to antibiotics and biocides unusually found in Antarctica. However, given the volcanic nature (heavy metals-rich region) of Deception Island soils, this putative impact must be viewed with caution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {97},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {Metabarcoding technologies for soil fungal DNA pools have enabled to capture the diversity of fungal community and the agreement of their beta-diversity with plant beta-diversity. However, processes underlying the synchrony of the aboveground-belowground biodiversity is still unclear. By using partitioning methods for plant beta-diversity, this study explored the process driving synchrony in tundra ecosystems, in which drastic vegetation shifts are observed with climate warming. Our methods based on Baselga's partitioning enabled the division of plant beta-diversity into two phenomena and three functional components. Correlation of fungal beta-diversity with the components of plant beta-diversity showed that the spatial replacement of fungi was promoted by plant species turnover, in particular, plant species turnover with functional exchange. In addition, spatial variety of graminoid or forbs species, rather than shrubs, enhanced fungal beta-diversity. These results suggest the importance of small-scale factors such as plant-fungal interactions or local environments modified by plants for the fungal community assemblage. The process-based understanding of community dynamics of plants and fungi allows us to predict the ongoing shrub encroachment in the Arctic region, which could weaken the aboveground-belowground synchrony.},

  YEAR = {1978},
  ABSTRACT = {The effect of temperature on the growth of Chrysosporium pannorum, Cylindrocarpon sp., Penicillium janthinellum and Phoma herbarum, isolated from tundra soils, was studied. The growth in 2 systems, glucose-mineral agar plates and sand, moistened with glucose-mineral broth, was compared. All isolates showed an exponential increase in mass (measured as protein increase) in sand and a linear rate of extension on agar. Radial increase on agar was shown not to be a good index of growth in sand. Trends in growth rates in the sand cultures indicated that all 4 fungi can grow at low temperatures. The growth rate for P. janthinellum at 15.degree. C was higher than at 20.degree. C, and Cylindrocarpon sp. and P. herbarum had higher growth rates at 2.5.degree. C than at 5.degree. C. These data suggest that there may be some adaptation by these fungi to growth in Arctic regions.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {88},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Adaptive reactions of Arctic and Antarctic strains of psychrophilic micromycetes Geomyces pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus to growth within a broad temperature range were studied. Adaptation of these species to different temperatures was found to result from both morphological and biochemical changes, including changes in the concentration of small molecules and lipid membrane components. These biochemical, morphological, and physiological mechanisms exhibited the patterns common to all strains, as well as species and strain differences. The general patterns included temperature-dependent changes in amounts of monosaccharides, some disaccharides, and free linoleic and linolenic acids. The differences between the Arctic and Antarctic strains were mainly associated with the differences in lipid composition, while interspecies differences resulted from metabolomic modifications. Antarctic strains showed lower ability to survive elevated temperatures, which correlated with weaker manifestation of the lipid-dependent adaptive mechanisms compared to the Arctic strains. Among the interstrain differences, higher growth parameters and mannitol accumulation were found in the Arctic isolates. Adaptation of T. microsporus was characterized by more diverse changes in the concentrations of small organic molecules in the metabolome profile and by pronounced changes in mycelial morphology. The results of metabolomic analysis and their subsequent treatment by the methods of multivariant statistics supported the suggestion of higher dispersion of metabolomic characteristics under unfavorable conditions and of lower dispersion of metabolomic data under optimal conditions.},

  TITLE = {Antarctic nematodes survival in Martian and Lunar regolith simulants under terrestrial conditions},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {96},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {The exploration of extraterrestrial environments has become a focal point of scientific inquiry, driven by advancements in technology and a growing interest in the potential for life beyond Earth. This study investigates the adaptability of Antarctic nematodes, known for thriving in extreme cold and isolation, to simulated Martian (MGS-1) and Lunar (LMS-1) soils. The experiment revealed differential responses in nematode survivability to the two simulants, with Lunar soil demonstrating better adaptability compared to Martian soil. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential survivability of Antarctic nematodes on real Martian and Lunar substrates with the use of the MGS-1 and the LMS-1 under terrestrial conditions. The observed results suggest differential survival responses to Lunar (6.92 +/- 0.74) and Martian (5.58 +/- 1.91) regolith simulants and highlight the complexity of factors influencing organismal survival. Considering their crucial role in soil food webs, and their relation with nutrient cycling and carbon dioxide emissions, the observed capacity of nematodes to thrive in Martian and Lunar regoliths positions them as potential candidates to sustain human habitats, helping on the development of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems, and forming the basis for a biological life-support system to facilitate human survival in extraterrestrial environments.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {99},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {The discordant trend of plant and fungal beta-diversity suggested an ecological rule reflecting plant-fungal interaction. Beta-diversity partitioning has shown that the nestedness component is developed with environmental stress in a variety of taxa. However, soil fungal community may maintain its turnover components in contrast to the development of plants' nestedness component, and the potential causes remain unclear. To investigate the process of species turnover of soil fungi along a stress gradient in the Arctic, we divided species turnover component into sub-components: beta(sim\_hete) and beta(sim\_homo) representing species turnover with and without a change in the guilds, respectively. The results indicate that fungal communities maintain their turnover components, unlike plant communities; however, their beta(sim\_hete) increased under stressful conditions. Additionally, GDM analysis showed that beta(sim\_hete) was mainly explained by stress gradient and plant nestedness, suggesting that the functionality of soil fungi was ecologically filtered by environmental stress and plant community structure. The discordant trend of beta-diversity values between plant and fungi (i.e. development of plant nestedness and maintenance of fungal turnover) is possibly not caused by different assembly rules working in parallel on the two taxa, but according to an ecological rule that reflects plant-fungal interaction.},

  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {The fungi and bacteria number, as well as the species composition of the fungi in the ground air layer in the European Arctic region of Russia, primarily in the tundra (the Rybachy Peninsula), in the subzone of the northern taiga (the Pasvik State Nature Reserve) and in the industrial areas (the Copper-Nickel Plant Pechenganickel, the Kandalaksha Aluminum Plant) have been studied. One hundred and ninety-two atmosphere air samples of various ecosystems have been analyzed. The sample collection took place in the summer-autumn period (June, July, September, in 2012-2015) with the aspirator, precipitating microorganisms on the surface of media. The number of microorganisms per 1m(3) of air was calculated. The portion of the airborne fungi in the ground air layer both in the tundra and in the taiga was higher in comparison with the bacteria, and amounted to 60-77\% of the total number colony forming units (CFU). The least number of microorganisms in the investigated period was registered in the Barents Sea coastal atmospheric air, only 11-15 microbial CFU per 1m(3). The airborne fungi diversity in the taiga zone was richer than in the tundra. The fungi of the g. Penicillium predominated in both zones air. Bacteria gram-positive (the division Fermicutes) predominated within the bacterial biota. The species Penicillium decumbens, P. raistrickii prevailed in the air of the background tundra zone regions. The representatives of the genus Torula and Sterilia mycelia, P. raistrickii predominated in the taiga zone. Close by the Copper-Nickel Plant (about 3km), the air bacterial contamination (100-600 CFU per 1m(3)) was revealed, with prevailing bacteria gram-negative (the division Gracilicutes). The species Cladosporium oxysporum predominated in the air to the greatest possible extent of the contaminated region due to the emissions of the Kandalaksha Aluminum Plant. The species Gongronella butleri were uppermost due to the emissions of the Copper-Nickel Plant << Pechenganickel >>. The quantity of the dark-pigmented fungi in the air for both zones amounted to 25\% of the total amount within the emphasized species. The composition of the air industrial emissions stimulated the development of specific airborne fungi which are essentially different from those of the background regions.},

  ABSTRACT = {The unusually harsh environmental conditions of terrestrial Antarctic habitats result in ecosystems with simplified trophic structures, where microbial processes are especially dominant as drivers of soil-borne nutrient cycling. We examined soil-borne Antarctic communities (bacteria, fungi and nematodes) at five locations along a southern latitudinal gradient from the Falkland Islands (51 degrees S) to the base of the Antarctic Peninsula (72 degrees S), and compared principally vegetated vs. fell-field locations at three of these sites. Results of molecular (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR), biochemical (ergosterol, phospholipid fatty acids) and traditional microbiological (temperature- and medium-related CFU) analyses were related to key soil and environmental properties. Microbial abundance generally showed a significant positive relationship with vegetation and vegetation-associated soil factors (e.g. water content, organic C, total N). Microbial community structure was mainly related to latitude or location and latitude-dependent factors (e.g. mean temperature, NO3, pH). Furthermore, strong interactions between vegetation cover and location were observed, with the effects of vegetation cover being most pronounced in more extreme sites. These results provide insight into the main drivers of microbial community size and structure across a range of terrestrial Antarctic and sub-Antarctic habitats, potentially serving as a useful baseline to study the impact of predicted global warming on these unique and pristine ecosystems.},

  YEAR = {1978},
  ABSTRACT = {Feeding habits of 25 spp. of oribatids from the North America arctic and subarctic were determined by gut content analysis. Over 50\% are panphytophages, a feeding habit considered to be ecologically advantageous, in that a particular species can survive in many different habitats. Microphytophagous species (11) were recorded, predominantly from the Damaeoidea, Eremaeoidea and Oppioidea. Individuals of 11 spp. of Oribatei were plated to examine the importance of mites in disseminating fungi. Fungal species (20) were identified from colonies growing on approximately 60\% of the plates. Most of the isolated fungi have a world-wide distribution, occurring in soils from tropical to arctic regions. Fecal pellets from 7 spp. were also plated. Fungal colonies grew from only 14\% of these pellets which may be a result of the feeding habits of the species examined. Most species being panphytophagous, the amount of fungal material in their gut would vary from meal to meal. The direct and indirect effects of oribatid mites on decomposition within the soil ecosystem is discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {A new species, Phalansterium arcticum sp. n., was isolated from an 8580-year-old Arctic permafrost layer. This organism typically lives as a sedentary uniflagellated cell enclosed in a thin flexible mucilaginous sheath, but can form naked swimming cells and amoeboid cells with eruptive pseudopodia accompanied with the formation of short, filopodia-like projections. In an SSU rDNA phylogenetic tree, it robustly groups with other species of this genus. Along with a description of the species, we also add new details to the description of the cell division of Phalansterium and the feeding process in this organism. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

  TITLE = {Resistance and change in a High Arctic ecosystem, NW Greenland: Differential sensitivity of ecosystem metrics to 15 years of experimental warming and wetting},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {28},
  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {Dramatic increases in air temperature and precipitation are occurring in the High Arctic (>70 degrees N), yet few studies have characterized the long-term responses of High Arctic ecosystems to the interactive effects of experimental warming and increased rain. Beginning in 2003, we applied a factorial summer warming and wetting experiment to a polar semidesert in northwest Greenland. In summer 2018, we assessed several metrics of ecosystem structure and function, including plant cover, greenness, ecosystem CO2 exchange, aboveground (leaf, stem) and belowground (litter, root, soil) carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations (\%) and pools, as well as leaf and soil stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Wetting induced the most pronounced changes in ecosystem structure, accelerating the expansion of Salix arctica cover by 370\% and increasing aboveground C, N, and biomass pools by 94\%-101\% and root C, N, and biomass pools by 60\%-122\%, increases which coincided with enhanced net ecosystem CO2 uptake. Further, wetting combined with warming enhanced plot-level greenness, whereas in isolation neither wetting nor warming had an effect. At the plant level, the effects of warming and wetting differed among species and included warming-linked decreases in leaf N and delta N-15 in S. arctica, whereas leaf N and delta N-15 in Dryas integrifolia did not respond to the climate treatments. Finally, neither plant- nor plot-level C and N allocation patterns nor soil C, N, delta C-13, or delta N-15 concentrations changed in response to our manipulations, indicating that these ecosystem metrics may resist climate change, even in the longer term. In sum, our results highlight the importance of summer precipitation in regulating ecosystem structure and function in arid parts of the High Arctic, but they do not completely refute previous findings of resistance in some High Arctic ecosystem properties to climate change.},

  TITLE = {Seasonal climate manipulations result in species-specific changes in leaf nutrient levels and isotopic composition in a sub-arctic bog},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {23},
  YEAR = {2009},
  ABSTRACT = {P>Climate change in cold biomes not only involves higher summer temperatures, but also warmer springs and more winter precipitation. So far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal components of climate change. We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the responses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia, the deciduous dwarf shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus. We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios) going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to N-limited plant growth. The natural abundance of N-15 varied very strongly among species and growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms, but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5 parts per thousand). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen shrubs < deciduous shrubs. After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming effects. This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of these climate changes.},

  ABSTRACT = {We introduced a novel combination of chromatographic techniques for the purification and analysis of a new UV-sunscreen mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) in the terrestrial green alga Prasiola calophylla. Prasiola calophylla (Carmichael ex Greville) Kutzing (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) is a typical member of terrestrial algal communities in temperate Europe, where it regularly experiences various stress conditions including strong diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in ultraviolet radiation (UVR). As a photoprotective mechanism Prasiola species and other related Trebouxiophycean taxa synthesize a mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) as natural sunscreen whose chemical structure was unknown so far. In the present study a new methodological approach is described for the isolation, purification and structural elucidation of this novel sunscreen in P. calophylla. The new compound exhibits an absorption maximum at 324 nm (in the short ultraviolet-A), a molecular weight of 333 and a molecular extinction coefficient of 12.393 M-1 cm(-1), and could be identified as N-{[}5,6 hydroxy-5(hydroxymethyl)-2-methoxy-3-oxo-1-cycohexen-1-yl] glutamic acid using one- and two-dimensional H-1 and C-13-NMR spectroscopy. As trivial name for this novel MAA we suggest `prasiolin'. The ecologically essential function of prasiolin for UVR-protection in terrestrial algae of the Trebouxiophyceae is discussed.},

  TITLE = {Rhizomarasmius epidryas (Physalacriaceae): phylogenetic placement of an arctic-alpine fungus with obligate saprobic affinity to Dryas spp.},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {103},
  YEAR = {2011},
  ABSTRACT = {As a part of a large-scale biogeographical study we examined the evolutionary relationships and taxonomic position of Marasmius epidryas, one of the most typical circumpolar arctic-alpine fungi, characterized by a specific, saprobic affinity to dead tissues of Dryas spp. A phylogenetic analysis based on nLSU and RPB2 DNA regions unequivocally indicated the phylogenetic placement of this species within the Physalacriaceae. The Bayesian MCMCMC analysis as well as other inference methods tested (ML, NJ) revealed a well supported affinity of M. epidryas to Rhizomarasmius pyrrhocephalus, type species of a recently circumscribed genus, Rhizomarasmius. As a consequence, based on these results, we introduce a new combination, Rhizomarasmius epidryas (Kuhner ex A. Ronikier) A. Ronikier and M. Ronikier. Thus our results demonstrate that neither the traditional taxonomic placement of the fungus in genus Marasmius nor the recent transfer into genus Mycetinis are phylogenetically correct. In contrast they support the importance of the third lineage of the polyphyletic Marasmius s. l., having evolutionary links with taxa forming the Physalacriaceae clade of agaricoid fungi. In addition the lineage of Rhizomarasmius was confirmed to be closely related to the representatives of Gloiocephala, comprising small, often narrowly specialized saprobic species previously also classified within Marasmius s. l.},

  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {Fungi are highly diverse, yet only a minor part of the total estimated species has been cultured and characterized. This might be especially true for Arctic, where studies on the fungal diversity are still scarce. For that reason, our aim was to analyze fungal diversity in the droppings of Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus. The samples of feces from 32 adult individuals were collected in the southern or central parts of the Wedel Jarlsberg Land (Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago) and assessed for micromycetes diversity using a combination of classical and molecular identification approaches. We found 16 fungal species, out of which three were described as mesophilic, two as psychrotolerant and eleven as psychrophilic. The identified Arctic fungi belonged to eleven genera out of which representatives of Naganishia genus (formerly belonging to Cryptococcus albidus clade) were the most abundant fungal species isolated. Additionally, to our knowledge, we firstly recorded Botrytis cinerea in polar areas. We conclude that droppings of R. tarandus platyrhynchus are a source of different fungal taxa, including fungi potentially pathogenic towards humans, plants and insects.},

  TITLE = {Characterization of psychrotolerant heterotrophic bacteria from Finnish Lapland},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {29},
  YEAR = {2006},
  ABSTRACT = {A total of 331 aerobic heterotrophic bacterial strains were isolated from various ecosystems of Finnish Lapland (68-69 degrees N) including forest soil, arctic alpine-tundra soil, stream water, lake and mire sediments, lichen and snow algae. Whole cell fatty acid and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and microscopy indicated that the isolates were dominated by Gram-negative bacteria, while only 20 Gram-positive strains were isolated. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences the isolates were members of alpha-, beta-, gamma-Proteobacteria, Gram-positives with low G+C content, Actinobacteria and the Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides group. More than one-third of the isolates could be tentatively identified as Pseudomonas spp. which were particularly abundant in the alpine-tundra soils where they represented 60\% of all isolates. Other frequently isolated Gram-negative taxa were Burkholderia sp., Collimonas sp., Pedobacter sp., Janthinobacter sp., Duganella sp., Dyella sp. and Sphingomonas sp. Growth temperature ranges and hydrolytic enzyme activities of selected ca. 100 strains were screened. The strains were psychrotolerant growing generally at temperatures ranging from 0 to 30 degrees C, as 82\% of the isolates grew at 0 degrees C while only 7\% grew at 35 degrees C. Protease and lipase activities at 5 degrees C were detected in more than half of the strains while approximately 20\% of the strains possessed amylase and/or cellulase activities.

  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Aim To screen and identify a potential biosurfactant-producing yeast strain isolated from Antarctic soil and to evaluate the fermentation process kinetics of the most promising strain on biosurfactant production using glycerol as carbon source. Methods and Results From the 68 isolated yeast strains, 11 strains were able to produce biosurfactants after Emulsification Index (E.I.) and Drop Collapse tests, reaching an E.I. higher than 10\%. Strain 1\_4.0 was the best producer, identified as Candida glaebosa based on molecular analysis. Yeast was cultivated in a medium composed of glycerol supplemented with yeast extract for 120 h to determine the process kinetics. The increased C/N ratio affected yeast growth and biosurfactant production. Biosurfactant release was associated with the end of exponential and beginning of the stationary growth phases. Results indicated an E.I. of 30\% at the end of the fermentation. Conclusions The feasiability of C. glaebosa to produce biosurfactant from a low-cost medium cultivation shows a great impact on the development of bioresource in the Antarctica terrestrial environment. Significance and Impact of the Study Although the diversity of psychrophilic/psychrotolerant micro-organisms from Antarctica has been the preferred subject of study by microbiologists, terrestrial microfungal communities are scarcely investigated and literature about the biotechnological potential of such micro-organisms should cover important biomolecules in addition to cold-adapted enzymes. In the present study, for the first time, the Maritime Antarctica environment was screened as a novel source of biosurfactants produced by micro-organisms.},

  ABSTRACT = {We quantified the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of fungi associated with dead moss tissues and conifer needles in a forest-tundra ecotone in a sub-Arctic region, Quebec, Canada. We detected 615 operational taxonomic units, in total, of fungi in 84 families with 97\% sequence similarity by metabarcoding the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Saprotrophs were the dominant functional guild. The results indicated the effects of host plant species and local environmental heterogeneity on fungal diversity in the cold region. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity indices of fungal communities were significantly greater in moss than in conifers. The greater phylogenetic diversity in moss was mainly attributable to the presence of families in Mucoromycota, compared to those in conifers, in which relatively closely related families of Dikarya were present. The taxonomic diversity was also related to local variations in vegetation and soil properties, suggesting that the local colonization and establishment of vegetation and the concomitant development of soil contributed to the taxonomic diversity of fungi. In contrast, functional diversity was not significantly affected by the host, vegetation, or soil properties, indicating that the fungal community members were relatively redundant in terms of the evaluated functional traits.},

  TITLE = {Detection and diversity of the mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) gene cluster and lipase A and B genes of Moesziomyces antarcticus isolated from terrestrial sites chronically contaminated with crude oil in Trinidad},

  ABSTRACT = {Background Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) belong to the class of glycolipid biosurfactants and are produced by members of the Ustilago and Moesziomyces genera. Production of MELs is regulated by a biosynthetic gene cluster (MEL BGC). Extracellular lipase activity is also associated with MEL production. Most microbial glycolipid-producers are isolated from oil-contaminated environments. MEL-producing yeast that are capable of metabolizing crude oil are understudied, and there is very limited data on indigenous strains from tropical climates. Analysis of the MEL BGC and lipase genes in Trinidad M. antarcticus strains, using a gene-targeted approach, revealed a correlation between their intrinsic capability to degrade crude oil and their adaptation to survive in a chronically polluted terrestrial environment. Results M. antarcticus was isolated from naturally-occurring crude oil seeps and an asphaltic mud volcano in Trinidad; these are habitats that have not been previously reported for this species. Genus identification was confirmed by the large-subunit (LSU) and the small-subunit (SSU) sequence comparisons and species identification was confirmed by ITS sequence comparisons and phylogenetic inference. The essential genes (Emt1, Mac1, Mac2, Mmf1) of the MEL BGC were detected with gene-specific primers. Emt1p, Mac1p and Mmf1p sequence analyses confirmed that the Trinidad strains harboured novel synonymous amino acid (aa) substitutions and structural comparisons revealed different regions of disorder, specifically for the Emt1p sequence. Functionality of each protein sequence was confirmed through motif mining and mutation prediction. Phylogenetic relatedness was inferred for Emt1p, Mac1p and Mmf1p sequences. The Trinidad strains clustered with other M. antarcticus sequences, however, the representative Trinidad M. antarcticus sequences consistently formed a separate, highly supported branch for each protein. Similar phylogenetic placement was indicated for LipA and LipB nucleotide and protein sequences. The Trinidad strains also demonstrated lipolytic activity in culture, with an ability to utilize different carbon sources. Comparative evolution of MEL BGC and LipA gene suggested early and late duplication events, depending on the gene, followed by a number of speciation events within Ustilaginaceae. M. antarcticus and M. aphidis were separated from all other members of Ustilaginaceae and two gene homologues were detected, one for each species. Conclusions Sequence analyses was based on a novel gene-targeted approach to analyze the essential genes of the MEL BGC and LipA and LipB genes of M. antarcticus strains from Trinidad. The findings indicated that these strains accumulated nucleotide mutations to a threshold level that did not affect the function of specific proteins encoded by the MEL BGC and LipA and LipB genes. The biosurfactant and lipase enzymes secreted by these Trinidad M. antarcticus strains facilitated their survival in oil-contaminated terrestrial environments. These findings suggest that the Trinidad strains should be explored as promising candidates for the commercial production of MEL biosurfactants and lipase enzymes.},

  ABSTRACT = {A study of the fungal flora of soils, plant leaves and litter was undertaken on the Truelove Lowland, on the north coast of Devon Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. A total of 53 taxa from 33 genera were identified, 27 from leaves and litter and 46 from soil, using soil-washing and plating as isolation methods. The predominant fungi on leaves and litter of Carex stans and Dryas integrifolia were sterile fungi, associated with Cladosporium, Phoma herbarum, Penicillium spp. and yeasts. Sterile fungi, Penicillium spp. and Chrysosporium pannorum were predominant in raised beach soils, whereas a new species of Cylindrocarpon (not ascribed here), a sterile fungi, Penicillium and Aspergillus species predominated in meadow soils. Use of direct observation methods showed that fungal biomass in meadow soils was much higher than in raised beach soils. In raised beach soils fungal biomass was heavily influenced by the distribution of cushion plants. In comparison with other tundra regions, the Truelove Lowland appears to have a moderately rich mycoflora, containing taxa common both in temperate regions and in other tundra soils. Total fungal biomass in Truelove Lowland soils was low in comparison with many tundra regions.},

  TITLE = {Inocybe praetervisa group - A clade of four closely related species with partly different geographical distribution ranges in Europe},
  TYPE = {Article; Proceedings Paper},
  VOLUME = {59},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Sequence data from a broad geographical region and different habitats show that the Inocybe praetervisa clade is comprised of four closely related species. These species of section Marginatae are characterized by having nodulose spores and a stipe that is abundantly pruinose only in the upper half. Inocybe praetervisa occurs in Southern Europe in mountainous mixed coniferous forests, and is not confirmed from Northern Europe. Inocybe rivularis occurs in northern boreal forests up to the lower alpine zone, associated with Betula in moist habitats, and is not confirmed from Southern Europe. Inocybe taxocystis is confirmed as a later synonym of I. favrei. The species has a wide geographical distribution range in Europe, mainly restricted to the alpine zone and moist soils, associated with Salix herbacea. Inocybe arctica is here described as a new species. It occurs in the arctic and higher alpine zones, associated with Dryas octopetala, Salix polaris, S. reticulata and S. herbacea. All species except I. arctica are shown to have an intercontinental distribution range and are confirmed from North America. Sequence data suggest the occurrence of one additional species in the alpine zone of China. A key to the species in the I. praetervisa group is provided. (C) 2017 The Mycological Society of Japan.

  TITLE = {Mycorrhizal fungi supply nitrogen to host plants in Arctic tundra and boreal forests: <SUP>15</SUP>N is the key signal},
  TYPE = {Article; Proceedings Paper},
  VOLUME = {55},
  YEAR = {2009},
  ABSTRACT = {Symbiotic fungi's role in providing nitrogen to host plants is well-studied in tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska, but little-studied in the adjoining boreal forest ecosystem. Along a 570 km north-south transect from the Yukon River to the North Slope of Alaska, the N-15 content was strongly reduced in ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plants including Betula, Salix, Picea mariana (P. Mill.) B. S. P., Picea glauca Moench (Voss), and ericaceous plants. Compared with the N-15 content of soil, the foliage of nonmycorrhizal plants (Carex and Eriophorum) was unchanged, whereas content of the ectomycorrhizal fungi was very much higher (e. g., Boletaceae, Leccinum and Cortinarius). It is hypothesized that similar processes operate in tundra and boreal forest, both nitrogen-limited ecosystems: (i) mycorrhizal fungi break down soil polymers and take up amino acids or other nitrogen compounds; (ii) mycorrhizal fungi fractionate against N-15 during production of transfer compounds; (iii) host plants are accordingly depleted in N-15; and (iv) mycorrhizal fungi are enriched in N-15. Increased N availability for plant roots or decreased light availability to understory plants may have decreased N allocation to mycorrhizal partners and increased delta N-15 by 3 parts per thousand-4 parts per thousand for southern populations of Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. and Salix. Fungal biomass, measured as ergosterol, correlated strongly with soil organic matter and attained amounts similar to those in temperate forest soils.},

  ABSTRACT = {Quantitative changes in bacterial, fungal and algal populations in the surface peat (0-5 cm depth) were studied during the spring thaw period at a tundra hummocky sedge-moss meadow (Devon Island, N.W.T. {[}Northwest Territories], Canada). A significant peak in numbers of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and in amounts of filamentous algae was observed during the thaw period. No significant maximum in fungal standing crop was evident during this period but an increase in the hyphae containing protoplasm after thaw was indicative of increased fungal activity. Data obtained at each sampling time were highly variable. This was probably due to the topographic heterogeneity of the site which gave rise to variation in soil moisture content and microenvironment. Qualitative changes in bacterial populations were studied before and after the thaw. Gram-negative psychotrophic types predominated and Bacillus spp. were rarely isolated. Certain gram-negative groups, the fluorescent pseudomonads and the Cytophaga/Flexibacter types, were isolated less frequently after thaw while gram-negative orange pigmented rods, Arthrobacter spp. and other coryneforms occurred more frequently after the thaw.},

  ABSTRACT = {The effect of 36 l m-2 of 20\% and 100\% methanol spillage on the microflora of a soil near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, was assessed. GLC was used to monitor the residual methanol in the soil. Associated with residual methanol determination were measurements of changes in numbers of bacteria, fungal standing crop, respiration and isolation of methanol-utilizing bacteria. Methanol spillage (20\%) had 2 different effects on the surface vegetation, in that the vegetation was killed in some plots and not others. The applied methanol disappeared completely between 1-4 wk. No increased soil activity (as indicated by respiration, bacterial numbers, fungal standing crop) was detected when methanol was present in the soil. Because only 1 bacterium (i.e., pink gram negative rods) metabolized only very small concentrations of methanol, biodegradation of methanol was not considered a significant agent affecting methanol loss from the soil.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {54},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {Using the method of inoculation of elective nutrient media, the abundance and taxonomic diversity of ecological and trophic groups of microorganisms in soils of the northern part of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago were evaluated. The content of aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen fixers, as well as denitrifiers, was low (tens and hundreds of CFU/g soil). The number of saprotrophic bacteria varied from 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) CFU/g soil; actinomycetes, from 1.3 x 10(3) to 4.0 x 10(5) CFU/g soil; and micromycetes, from 2.5 x 10(2) to 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/g soil. The abundances of all studied groups of microorganisms (except for aerobic nitrogen fixers) in the studied soils sharply decreased down the profile, and this correlated positively with the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen. The community of soil microorganisms was dominated by gram-positive bacteria of the genera Arthrobacter and Bacillus; actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces and Micromonospora; and micromycetes of the genera Goffeauzyma, Phoma, Pseudogymnoascus, and Thelebolus. In general, the abundance and taxonomic diversity of cultured microorganisms in the soils of the northern part of Novaya Zemlya were lower than in the soils of the more northern territories of the Franz Josef Land Archipelago. This phenomenon is associated with the drying and cooling effect of the largest glacier in Russia on the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper reports the discovery of endolithic algae from vertical limestone cliffs associated with the Niagara Escarpment, southern Ontario, Canada. The endolithic habitat forms a distinctive dark green layer 1-3 mm below the surface of the porous dolomitic limestone. Samples of the algal layer were isolated from freshly cleaved rock samples using sterile probes and grown on a solid (agarized) standard algal mineral medium supplemented with soil extract. A diverse assemblage of organisms grew on the agar plates, including bacteria, fungi, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), green algae, yellow-green algae, and occasionally the protonemata of mosses. Isolated algae belong to unicellular, colonial, and filamentous morphological types. Algal genera that have been identified include seven blue-green algae (Cyanophyta or Cyanobacteria), six green algae (Chlorophyta), and one yellow-green alga (Xanthophyceae). Six of the algal genera found in Ontario rocks also occur inside rocks of the Colorado plateau in northern Arizona, and one genus also occurs inside Antarctic rocks.},

  TITLE = {Characterization of Franz Josef Land Soil Mycobiota by Microbiological Plating and Real-time PCR},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {91},
  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {The mycobiota of the following soils of the Franz Josef Land archipelago was characterized using the classical plating techniques and real-time PCR methods: Cryosols (Arenic), Cryosols (Loamic), Oxyaquic Cryosols (Loamic), Leptosols (Loamic), and Cryosols (Loamic, Humic). The total abundance of microscopic fungi varied from 3.10 x 10(1) CFU/g soil in deep mineral horizons to 6.56 x 10(3) CFU/g soil in the upper organogenic soil horizons. A total of 47 micromycete species were isolated, which belonged to 32 genera from three divisions. Psychrotolerant strains growing at both 5 and 25 degrees C were predominant. The genera Penicillium (five species), Cadophora (four species), Cladosporium, Phoma, and Thelebolus (three species each) exhibited the highest species diversity. The most numerous genera: Penicillium, Hyphozyma, Phoma, Antarctomyces, and Pseudogymnoascus, were saprotrophic and common in cold ecosystems. Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Hyphozyma variabilis var. variabilis, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, Thelebolus microsporus, and Goffeauzyma gilvescens were the species most often revealed by plating (over 40\% occurrence). A significant part (30\%) of identified species were those included in the BSL database of species pathogenic for humans and animals. The number of copies of fungal rRNA gene ITSs varied from 1.00 x 10(9) to 4.40 x 10(10) copies/g soil in the mineral and organogenic layers, respectively. Spatial heterogeneity of mycobiota in the soils of the Franz Josef Land archipelago was revealed within the upper 5-cm layer, while deeper horizons were characterized by a uniform structure of micromycete communities.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {436},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {AimsThe aim of this study was to cross correlate data on physico-chemical parameters of soil with rhizosphere microorganisms and plant species in order to gain more knowledge about formation of soil and development of plants in the face of the changing climate on Spitsbergen and relations between them.MethodsWe investigated physico-chemical parameters of soil samples and the number and biodiversity of microorganisms, bacteria (oligotrophic and copiotrophic), and fungi. Moreover, heavy metal concentrations in 6 species of vascular plants collected in different areas were analysed.ResultsThe soil samples varied considerably in pH - from acid to alkaline, texture - from sand to loamy sand, and C:N ratio - from very low to high. In the soils, only partial Cd elevation expressed as the geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and the enrichment factor (EF) was detected. In the plants, the most significantly elevated concentrations of heavy metals expressed as I-geo and EF as well as the biological accumulation factor, bioconcentration factor, and translocation factor were detected in Salix polaris, Dryas octopetala, and Draba corymbosa. The high number of bacteria corresponded with an increase in the ecophysiological diversity index and the low colony development index, whereas a reverse relationship was found for fungi.ConclusionsThere was no significant impact of the geochemical properties on the total content of heavy metals in soil. The similar position of Cd and Pb in the order of heavy metal accumulation in the soil and plants was confirmed. TF showed that mainly these two metals were transported efficiently from roots to shoots. In the plants, the metals were distributed depending on the life form and their higher levels were detected in the woody perennials, e.g. S. polaris, D. octopetala, D. corymbosa, than in the herbaceous perennials. Very high numbers of culturable microorganisms were determined, regardless of the soil properties and plant species, which indicated that they were involved in the transformation of compounds containing C, N, and P and in the availability of heavy metals. The microorganisms and plants colonizing Spitsbergen soils showed great plasticity and adaptability to low temperatures and elevated Cd content.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {16},
  YEAR = {2025},
  ABSTRACT = {The genus Pseudogymnoascus includes several species frequently isolated from extreme environments worldwide, including cold environments such as Antarctica. This study describes three new species of Pseudogymnoascus-P. russus sp. nov., P. irelandiae sp. nov., and P. ramosus sp. nov.-isolated from Antarctic soils. These species represent the first Pseudogymnoascus taxa to be formally described from Antarctic soil samples, expanding our understanding of fungal biodiversity in this extreme environment. Microscopic descriptions of asexual structures from living cultures, along with measurements of cultural characteristics and growth on various media types at different temperatures, identify three distinct new species. In addition, phylogenetic analyses based on five gene regions (ITS, LSU, MCM7, RPB2, TEF1) and whole-genome proteomes place these new species within three distinct previously described clades: P. irelandiae in clade K, P. ramosus in clade Q, and P. russus in clade B. These results provide further evidence of the extensive undescribed diversity of Pseudogymnoascus in high-latitude soils. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on Antarctic mycology and the broader ecology of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant fungi.},

  ABSTRACT = {Soil microorganisms play fundamental roles in cycling of soil carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients, yet we have a poor understanding of how soil microbiomes are shaped by their nutritional and physical environment. In this study, we investigated the successional dynamics of a soil microbiome during 21 weeks of enrichment on chitin and its monomer, N-acetylglucosamine. We examined succession of the soil communities in a physically heterogeneous soil matrix as well as a homogeneous liquid medium. The guiding hypothesis was that the initial species richness would influence the tendency for the selected consortia to stabilize and maintain a relatively constant community structure over time. We also hypothesized that long-term, substrate-driven growth would result in consortia with reduced species richness compared to the parent microbiome and that this process would be deterministic with relatively little variation between replicates. We found that the initial species richness does influence the long-term community stability in both liquid media and soil and that lower initial richness results in a more rapid convergence to stability. Despite use of the same soil inoculum and access to the same major substrate, the resulting community composition differed greatly in soil from that in liquid medium. Hence, distinct selective pressures in soils relative to homogenous liquid media exist and can control community succession dynamics. This difference is likely related to the fact that soil microbiomes are more likely to thrive, with fewer compositional changes, in a soil matrix than in liquid environments. IMPORTANCE The soil microbiome carries out important ecosystem functions, but interactions between soil microbial communities have been difficult to study due to the high microbial diversity and complexity of the soil habitat. In this study, we successfully obtained stable consortia with reduced complexity that contained species found in the original source soil. These consortia and the methods used to obtain them can be a valuable resource for exploration of specific mechanisms underlying soil microbial community ecology. The results of this study also provide new experimental context to better inform how soil microbial communities are shaped by new environments and how a combination of initial taxonomic structure and physical environment influences stability.},

  ABSTRACT = {The modern concept of the evolution of Mars assumes that life could potentially have originated on the planet Mars, possibly during the end of the late heavy bombardment, and could then be transferred to other planets. Since then, physical and chemical conditions on Mars changed and now strongly limit the presence of terrestrial-like life forms. These adverse conditions include scarcity of liquid water (although brine solutions may exist), low temperature and atmospheric pressure, and cosmic radiation. Ionizing radiation is very important among these life-constraining factors because it damages DNA and other cellular components, particularly in liquid conditions where radiation-induced reactive oxidants diffuse freely. Here, we investigated the impact of high doses (up to 2 kGy) of densely-ionizing (197.6 keV/mu m), space-relevant iron ions (corresponding on the irradiation that reach the uppermost layer of the Mars subsurface) on the survival of an extremophilic terrestrial organism-Cryomyces antarcticus-in liquid medium and under atmospheric conditions, through different techniques. Results showed that it survived in a metabolically active state when subjected to high doses of Fe ions and was able to repair eventual DNA damages. It implies that some terrestrial life forms can withstand prolonged exposure to space-relevant ion radiation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp \& Endl.) Krasser, known as ``lenga{''} is the most important timber wood species in southernmost Patagonia (Argentina). Humicolopsis cephalosporioides Cabral \& Marchand is a soil fungus associated with Nothofagus pumilio forests, which has outstanding cellulolytic activity. However, there is no information about the ability of this fungus to use organic substrates other than cellulose, and its ability to produce different enzyme systems, as well as its response to temperature. Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the role of H. cephalosporioides in degradation processes in N. pumilio forests in detail by evaluating the in vitro ability of four isolates of this fungus to grow and produce different lytic enzyme systems, and their response to incubation temperature. Methods: The ability of the fungi to grow and produce enzyme systems was estimated by inoculating them on agar media with specific substrates, and the cultures were incubated at three temperatures. Results: A differential behavior of each strain in levels of growth and enzyme activity was found according to the medium type and/or incubation temperature. Conclusions: A intra-specific variability was found in H. cephalosporioides. Likewise a possible link between the saprotrophic role of this fungus in N. pumilio forests and the degradation of organic matter under stress conditions, such as those from frosty environments, was also discussed.

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {58},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Psychrotolerant yeast Rhodotorula sp. Y-23 was isolated from the sediment core sub-samples of Nella Lake, East Antarctica. Isolate was screened for lipase production using plate assay method followed by submerged fermentation. Production optimization revealed the maximum lipase production by using palmolein oil (5\% v/v), pH 8.0 and inoculum size of 2.5\% v/v at 15 degrees C. The potential inducers for lipase were 1\% w/v of galactose and KNO3, and MnCl2 (0.1\% w/v). Final productions with optimized conditions gave 5.47-fold increase in lipase production. Dialyzed product gave a purification fold of 5.63 with specific activity of 26.83Umg(-1) and 15.67\% yields. This lipase was more stable at pH 5.0 and -20 degrees C whereas more activity was found at pH 8.0 and 35 degrees C. Stability was more in 50mM Fe3+, EDTA-Na (20mM), sodium deoxycholate (20mM), H2O2 (1\% v/v), and almost all organic solvents (50\% v/v). Tolerance capacity at wider range of pH and temperature with having lower K-m value i.e., 0.08mgml(-1) and higher V-max 385.68Umg(-1) at 15 degrees C make the studied lipase useful for industrial applications. Besides this, the lipase was compatible with commercially available detergents, and its addition to them increases lipid degradation performances making it a potential candidate in detergent formulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {The role of organo-mineral interactions, microbial dynamics, and vertical plant input profiles are hypothesized to be important in controlling soil organic matter (SOM) stocks and dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we enhanced and applied a model (Biotic and Abiotic Model of SOM BAMSI) that represents microbial dynamics and organo-mineral interactions integrated with a multiphase reactive transport solver for variably saturated porous media. The model represents aqueous chemistry, aqueous advection and diffusion, gaseous diffusion, sorption processes, bacterial and fungal activity, and archetypal monomer-and polymer-carbon substrate groups, including dead cell wall material. This model structure is fundamentally different, and produces different SOM dynamics, than the pseudo-first order relationships that are used in most site-and global-scale terrestrial SOM models. We simulated two grasslands, a seven-site chronosequence (-3.9-240 K gamma) in Northern California, and a Russian Chernozem site where soils were sampled 100 years apart. We calibrated the model's vertically-resolved soil bulk specific surface area (SBSSA) using observed bulk SOM content, and then tested the model against observed triangle C-14 profiles. The modeled microbial processes, organo-mineral interactions, and vertical aqueous transport produced realistic vertically-resolved predictions of bulk SOM content, triangle C-14 values of SOM, lignin content, and fungi -to-aerobic bacteria biomass ratios. Using sensitivity analyses, we found that vertical carbon input profiles were important controls over the triangle C-14 depth distribution. Shallower carbon input profiles lead to older carbon at depth. In addition, the SBSSA was the dominant control over the magnitude and vertical distribution of SOM stocks. The findings of this study demonstrate the value of explicitly incorporating microbial activity, sorption, and vertical transport into land models to predict SOM dynamics.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities have been studied worldwide; however, those in the very cold and dry continental climate zone of northern Eurasia remain understudied. We investigated EM fungal community structure on plant roots and its determinants in eastern Siberia. We identified 291 EM fungal taxa belonging to 37 fungal genera from nine sites spanning 2100 km. In a variation partitioning analysis, host plant phylogeny was the primary factor that explained variation in fungal community composition, followed by spatial distance, soil, and climate. Host specificity and preference were attributed to differences in EM fungal community composition among host plants. The EM fungal community on Larix cajanderi, the dominant canopy tree in the region, was characterized by a high proportion of Suillus and Rhizopogon species. This implies that these specialist fungal symbionts have a close ecological relationship with pioneer Larix trees to adapt to the harsh continental climate of Siberia.},

  TYPE = {Article; Proceedings Paper},
  VOLUME = {55},
  YEAR = {2009},
  ABSTRACT = {Investigations of microbial diversity in Antarctic are important to begin to understand ecosystem functioning and decomposition processes. This study documents fungi at 9 historic sites on the Antarctic Peninsula collected from wooden structures, other organic materials, and soils during a joint National Science Foundation and British Antarctic Survey expedition in 2007. Many of these sites had wooden structures built by the British during the World War II Operation Tabarin, but others visited included the American ``East Base'' on Stonington Island and the Swedish hut on Snow Hill Island. Fungi were cultured on several different media and pure cultures were obtained and identified by DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Cadophora species previously found to attack historic wooden structures on Ross Island, Antarctica, were found at all but 1 location sampled in the Peninsula region. Fungi causing decay in the historic wooden structures and artifacts and those causing mold problems inside the structures are of great concern, and conservation efforts are urgently needed to help preserve these important polar heritage structures. The results presented also expand our knowledge on the identity of fungi present throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region and provide insights into the organisms responsible for decomposition and nutrient recycling.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {27},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {Shrub encroachment and soil respiration (SR) are predicted to increase in the tundra ecosystem under climate warming, but little is known regarding potential causal relationships between shrubs and SR at a local scale. Multiple and complex belowground processes exist between the two phenomena, and consolidation is logistically difficult. Our study aimed to identify and integrate multiple belowground processes to elucidate the impact of shrub coverage on SR, using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results indicated that shrub coverage enhanced SR through root biomass, fungal community composition and soil temperature. SEM also revealed a potential indirect effect via interactions among those soil factors. Soil factors relating heterotrophic respiration affected on SR through more complex interaction among the factors. However, total effect sizes on SR were similar between factors relating autotrophic respiration and that relating heterotrophic respiration, suggesting that SR increases with shrub coverage would be unlikely to result from decreases in soil organic matter.},

In this study, we introduce the new genus Pseudoxenochalara gen. nov. to the Dermateaceae family, which is supported by morphological observations and multilocus phylogenetic analysis. Partial sequences of the loci encoding beta-tubulin (BenA), ribosomal polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), 28S rDNA (LSU) and internal transcribed spacer rDNA region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) were analysed. This genus comprises one new species, P. grumantiana, isolated from the soil of the Arctic tundra near the settlement of Barentsburg (the Svalbard archipelago). The asexual morph of P. grumantiana was described. The sequences data, as well as the macroand micromorphological characteristics distinguish P. grumantiana from all known species in the Dermateaceae family.},

  ABSTRACT = {The fungal communities associated with three bryophytes species (the liverwort Barbilophozia hatcheri, the mosses Chorisodontium aciphyllum and Sanionia uncinata) in the Fildes Region, King George Island, maritime Antarctica, were studied using clone library analysis. Fungal communities showed low diversity; the 680 clones belonged to 93 OTUs. Of these, 78 belonged to the phylum Ascomycota, 13 to the phylum Basidiomycota, 1 to the phylum Zygomycota, and 1 to an unknown phylum. Among the OTUs, the most common orders in the Ascomycota were Helotiales (42 OTUs) and Chaetothyriales (14 OTUs) and the most common orders in the Basidiomycota were Sebacinales (3 OTUs) and Platygloeales (3 OTUs). Most OTUs clustered within clades that contained phylotypes identified from samples in Antarctic or Arctic ecosystems or from bryophytes in other ecosystems. In addition, we found that host-related factor may shape the fungal communities associated with bryophytes in this region. This is the first systematic study of the fungal community in Antarctic bryophytes to be performed using culture-independent method and the results may improve understanding of the endophytic fungal evolution and ecology in the Antarctic ecosystem.},

  ABSTRACT = {A strain of Phialocephala fortinii isolated from Luetkea pectinata was used to inoculate axenically grown 1-wk-old Menziesia ferruginea (Ericaceae) seedlings in cellulose agar petri dish cultures. After 3 mo, P. fortinii was observed in cortical cells of whole root mounts. but not in the stele. The fungus produced dark, simple septate hyphae forming extensive wefts on the root surface and intracortical sclerotia consisting of compact masses of darkly pigmented and irregularly lobed, thick-walled hyphae. Isolates of P. fortinii also formed numerous sclerotia in the cellulose agar medium. Presence of P. fortinii caused a ten-fold increase in seedling mortality over controls. Growth rates, based on whole plant fresh weight, were not affected by the presence of P. fortinii. Cenococcum geophilum, Phialocephala dimorphospora, and Phialophora finlandia, which were also used as inoculum for comparative purposes, did not form sclerotia in M. ferruginea. This is the first report to show that the distinct fungus-root associations formed between P.fortinii and subalpine plants can be reproduced consistently in pure culture under laboratory conditions.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {38},
  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {Seven chromate-reducing yeasts isolated from Antarctic soils (with no history of Cr(VI) contamination) were evaluated as promising candidates for alleviating Cr(VI)-contamination. These yeast species have not been extensively studied regarding Cr(VI) tolerance and reduction abilities. Based on their tolerance (up to 2 mM) and ability to remove Cr(VI) from culture media, two representative isolates of Candida sake \#14 and Debaryomyces hansenii \#35 were chosen. The resistant yeasts were cultivated in YM medium plus 1 mM Cr(VI) at 25 degrees C, causing a removal of similar to 90 and similar to 70\% hexavalent chromium before reaching 96 h of culture according to growth curves of C. sake \#14 and D. hansenii \#35, respectively. Cr(VI) removal kinetic analysis indicated that both isolates removed Cr(VI) by reduction to Cr(III), and incorporated a small portion into the biomass. Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) confirms the biosorption process, indicating the existence of a complex remediation mechanism. In conclusion, Antarctica is an extreme environment with a potential to discover promising new candidates for the removal of Cr(VI). These results are interesting from a biotechnological point of view since psychrotolerant yeasts could be involved in the design of a profitable technology for the elimination of the toxic form of Cr.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {243},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {Climate warming is severely affecting high-latitude regions. In the Arctic tundra, it may lead to enhanced soil nutrient availability and interact with simultaneous changes in grazing pressure. It is presently unknown how these concurrently occurring global change drivers affect the root-associated fungal communities, particularly mycorrhizal fungi, and whether changes coincide with shifts in plant mycorrhizal types. We investigated changes in root-associated fungal communities and mycorrhizal types of the plant community in a 10-yr factorial experiment with warming, fertilisation and grazing exclusion in a Finnish tundra grassland. The strongest determinant of the root-associated fungal community was fertilisation, which consistently increased potential plant pathogen abundance and had contrasting effects on the different mycorrhizal fungal types, contingent on other treatments. Plant mycorrhizal types went through pronounced shifts, with warming favouring ecto- and ericoid mycorrhiza but not under fertilisation and grazing exclusion. Combination of all treatments resulted in dominance by arbuscular mycorrhizal plants. However, shifts in plant mycorrhizal types vs fungi were mostly but not always aligned in their magnitude and direction. Our results show that our ability to predict shifts in symbiotic and antagonistic fungal communities depend on simultaneous consideration of multiple global change factors that jointly alter plant and fungal communities.},

  YEAR = {1993},
  ABSTRACT = {The potential for Pythium species to reduce sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) seedling growth and for rhizobia and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi to enhance seedling growth were studied under controlled conditions. Seedling emergence and shoot dry weights of cvs. Nova and Melrose in pasteurized soils infested with each of 18 isolates of Pythium spp. were reduced. Seedlings inoculated with arctic rhizobia grew more rapidly than noninoculated seedlings. Plant growth, nodule dry weight, nitrogenase activity, and mycorrhizal colonization of sainfoin dually inoculated with Rhizobium plus either Glomus fasciculatus or G. intraradices were greater than those of uninoculated plants or those inoculated with either rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungus alone; nitrogen content was higher in plants concomitantly inoculated with Rhizobium plus G. intraradices. Seedling survival and growth in Pythium-infested soil increased for seeds treated with metalaxyl. Interactions of VA mycorrhizal fungi and two isolates of Pythium were investigated under controlled conditions. Shoot dry weights of sainfoin plants inoculated with VA mycorrhizal fungi significantly exceeded those of nonmycorrhizal plants. Seedlings inoculated with VA mycorrhizal fungi had a lower incidence of root rot than non-mycorrhizal ones. This study suggested that a combination of rhizobia, metalaxyl, and VA mycorrhizal fungi could be used to improve the establishment and vigor of sainfoin in Pythium-infested soils.},

  ABSTRACT = {Soils support a vast amount of carbon (C) that is vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic global change stressors (for example, drought and human-induced nitrogen deposition). However, the simultaneous effects of an increasing number of global change stressors on soil C storage and persistence across ecosystems are virtually unknown. Here, using 1,880 surface soil samples from 68 countries across all continents, we show that increases in the number of global change stressors simultaneously exceeding medium-high levels of stress (that is, relative to their maximum levels observed in nature) are negatively and significantly correlated with soil C stocks and mineral association across global biomes. Soil C is particularly vulnerable in low-productivity ecosystems (for example, deserts), which are subjected to a greater number of global change stressors exceeding medium-high levels of stress simultaneously. Taken together, our work indicates that the number of global change stressors is a crucial factor for soil C storage and persistence worldwide. Soil carbon storage is vulnerable to various climatic and anthropogenic global change stressors (for example drought, warming, land-use intensification). Here the authors show that multiple stress factors act simultaneously to reduce soil carbon storage and persistence across global biomes.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper provides the results of a study on fungal species diversity in the active and permafrost layers of peatlands within frozen peatbogs in the flatland areas of the cryolitozone, European Northeast of Russia (forest-tundra zone, southern and northern tundra subzones). Fungal taxonomic list includes eighty-three species from seventeen genera and two forms of Mycelia sterilia. The phylum Mucoromycota is represented by fifteen species (18\% of total isolate number), and these species exhibit the following distribution by genus: Mucor (four), Mortierella (seven), Umbelopsis (three), Podila (one). Ascomycota is represented by sixty-eight species from thirteen genera. The genus Penicillium dominates the species saturation (thirty-seven species, 44\%). Soil microfungal complex is represented by rare species (51\%), random species (32\%), frequent species (15\%), and dominant species (2\%). In peat soils, dominant species are Penicillium canescens (72\%) and non-pigmented (albino) Mycelia sterilia (61\%); abundant species are Talaromyces funiculosus (41\%), Pseudogymnoascus pannorum (36\%), albino Mycelia sterilia (29\%), Umbelopsis vinacea (25\%), Mortierella alpina (17\%), Penicillium decumbens (21\%), P. spinulosum (20\%), and P. canescens (17\%). In active layers of peat soils, abundant species are Penicillium thomii (14\%), Mycelia sterilia (13\%), Penicillium spinulosum (13\%), Penicillium simplicissimum (13\%) in forest-tundra; Talaromyces funiculosus (21\%), albino Mycelia sterilia (15\%), Umbelopsis vinacea (14\%) in southern tundra; Penicillium decumbens (23\%), P. canescens (17\%), P. thomii (13\%) in northern tundra. In permafrost peat layers, abundant species are Penicillium spinulosum (17\%), Talaromyces funiculosus (34\%), and Umbelopsis vinacea (15\%) in forest-tundra; Pseudogymnoascus pannorum (30\%) and Mortierella alpina (28\%) in southern tundra; Pseudogymnoascus pannorum (80\%) in northern tundra.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {168},
  YEAR = {2001},
  ABSTRACT = {Fossil evidence of a high southern palaeolatitude (approximately 75-78 degrees South) Middle Jurassic (Temaikan) forest from Gondwana is investigated from the Murihiku Supergroup exposed at Kawhia Harbour. North Island, New Zealand. Horizons of fossilised tree stumps, preserved in growth position and rooted within coal-rich layers at bedding contacts, are exposed within cross-bedded medium-grained sandstone on the present-day shore platform. Interbedded siltstone and fine-grained sandstone contain terrestrial palynomorphs, fossilised leaves and other macroflora material (including cones and seeds). The sediments are interpreted as three fluvial facies (vegetated bar top, major sheet flood and channel fill and migration) within a sandy braided river palaeoenvironment. The fossil flora suggest the original vegetation was multi-layered and dominated by gymnosperms and ferns. Lycopods, bryophytes, fungi and algae also grew on the forest floor and in bar top pools. A model of plant communities is presented reflecting changing habitats up the side of interdistributary bars. The model is based on stratigraphically successive taphocenoses within vegetated bar top facies and the preferred growing conditions and life forms of comparable modern relatives. Lycopods and bryophytes on the saturated channel banks became less frequent higher up the bar on the damp, partially drained soil preferred by ferns and cycad trees. Favouring the drier bar top, arborescent gymnosperms thrived around probably ephemeral pools containing lycopods, bryophytes and algae. The characteristics of this fossil forest at Kawhia Harbour compare well to a similar Middle Jurassic site at Curie Bay in South Island, New Zealand, and other high southern palaeolatitude fossil floras from the late Mesozoic. A humid, warm climate with high average annual rainfall and large storms is interpreted from the Kawhia Harbour fossil forest for the New Zealand Middle Jurassic. These palaeoclimatic conditions are comparable to the modern mesothermal zone. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  TITLE = {Environmental DNA - An emerging tool in conservation for monitoring past and present biodiversity},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {183},
  YEAR = {2015},
  ABSTRACT = {The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {54},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {We provide the first assessment of fungal diversity associated with historic wooden structures at Whalers Bay (Heritage Monument 71), Deception Island, maritime Antarctic, using DNA metabarcoding. We detected a total of 177 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) dominated by the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Rozellomycota, and Zoopagomycota. The assemblages were dominated by Helotiales sp. 1 and Herpotrichiellaceae sp. 1. Functional assignments indicated that the taxa detected were dominated by saprotrophic, plant and animal pathogenic, and symbiotic taxa. Metabarcoding revealed the presence of a rich and complex fungal community, which may be due to the wooden structures acting as baits attracting taxa to niches sheltered against extreme conditions, generating a hotspot for fungi in Antarctica. The sequences assigned included both cosmopolitan and endemic taxa, as well as potentially unreported diversity. The detection of DNA assigned to taxa of human and animal opportunistic pathogens raises a potential concern as Whalers Bay is one of the most popular visitor sites in Antarctica. The use of metabarcoding to detect DNA present in environmental samples does not confirm the presence of viable or metabolically active fungi and further studies using different culturing conditions and media, different growth temperatures and incubation periods, in combination with further molecular approaches such as shotgun sequencing are now required to clarify the functional ecology of these fungi.},

  TITLE = {Brazilian research on extremophiles in the context of astrobiology},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {11},
  YEAR = {2012},
  ABSTRACT = {Extremophiles are organisms adapted to grow at extreme ranges of environmental variables, such as high or low temperatures, acid or alkaline medium, high salt concentration, high pressures and so forth. Most extremophiles are micro-organisms that belong to the Archaea and Bacteria domains, and are widely spread across the world, which include the polar regions, volcanoes, deserts, deep oceanic sediments, hydrothermal vents, hypersaline lakes, acid and alkaline water bodies, and other extreme environments considered hostile to human life. Despite the tropical climate, Brazil has a wide range of ecosystems which include some permanent or seasonally extreme environments. For example, the Cerrado is a biome with very low soil pH with high Al+3 concentration, the mangroves in the Brazilian coast are anaerobic and saline, Pantanal has thousands of alkaline-saline lakes, the Caatinga arid and hot soils and the deep sea sediments in the Brazilian ocean shelf. These environments harbour extremophilic organisms that, coupled with the high natural biodiversity in Brazil, could be explored for different purposes. However, only a few projects in Brazil intended to study the extremophiles. In the frame of astrobiology, for example, these organisms could provide important models for defining the limits of life and hypothesize about life outside Earth. Brazilian microbiologists have, however, studied the extremophilic micro-organisms inhabiting non-Brazilian environments, such as the Antarctic continent. The experience and previous results obtained from the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) provide important results that are directly related to astrobiology. This article is a brief synopsis of the Brazilian experience in researching extremophiles, indicating the most important results related to astrobiology and some future perspectives in this area.

  ABSTRACT = {Context Soil fungi and bacteria play a crucial role in decomposing soil organic matter (SOM) and providing nutrients to terrestrial ecosystems. However, in polar environments, their relative contributions to decomposition remain unclear.Aims This study aimed to determine whether fungi or bacteria contributes more to humic substances (HS) decomposition (the largest constituent of SOM) in maritime Antarctic soils under controlled laboratory conditions with elevated temperature and moisture levels.Methods Soil culturing method was used to select for soil microbes that efficiently degrade HS. During culturing at 18 degrees C for 30 days, Antarctic soils were treated with selective antimicrobials to manipulate microbial communities. After culturing, HS degradation and bacterial communities were analysed. The effects of soil culturing on plant growth were also evaluated using Arabidopsis thaliana as a surrogate for Antarctic plants.Key results HS decomposition and solubilisation were more pronounced in antifungal-treated soils compared to antibacterial-treated soils. Antifungal treatment reduced bacterial alpha diversity, altered bacterial composition, and increased the abundance of rhizosphere-associated Saccharibacteria. Bacterial growth resumed quickly after antibacterial treatment indicating resilience to antimicrobials. Soil culturing resulted in a higher water-soluble HS fraction, which significantly enhanced the fresh and dry weights of A. thaliana.Conclusions Antarctic bacteria exhibit higher degradative activity and resilience to antimicrobials compared to fungi, promoting HS decomposition and solubilisation. This indicates that bacteria have a greater impact on Antarctic soil functioning than fungi.Implications These findings highlight the critical role of bacteria in nutrient cycling and plant growth in polar ecosystems.},

  ABSTRACT = {A total of 969 microbial strains were isolated from soil samples and tested to determine their lipolytic activity by employing screening techniques on solid and in liquid media. Ten lipase-producing microorganisms were selected and their taxonomic identification was carried out. From these strains Achremonium murorum, Monascus mucoroides, Arthroderma ciferri, Fusarium poae, Ovadendron sulphureo-ochraceum and Rhodotorula araucariae are described as lipase-producers for the first time. Hydrolysis activity of the crude lipases against both tributyrin and olive oil was measured. Heptyl oleate synthesis was carried out to test the activity of the selected lipases as biocatalysts in organic medium. All the selected lipases were tested as biocatalysts in several organic reactions using unnatural substrates. Lipases from the fungi Fusarium. oxysporum and O. sulphurco-ochraceum gave the best yields and enantioselectivities in the esterification of carboxylic acids. F: oxysporum and Penicillium chrysogenum lipases were the most active ones for the acylation of alcohols without steric hindrance. A. murorum lipase is very useful for the esterification of menthol. F: oxysporum and Fusarium. solani lipases were very stereoselective in the synthesis of carbamates. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {99},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {Primary succession and microtopography result in environmental changes and are important processes influencing the community assembly of soil fungi in the Arctic region. In glacier forefields that contain a series of moraine ridges, both processes contribute synchronously to fungal spatial diversity. To reveal the synergistic effects of succession and microtopography, we investigated the fungal community structure and environmental variables in the moraines of the Arklio Glacier, Ellesmere Island. The study sites were established at four locations from the top to the bottom of the ridge slope within each of the three moraine ridges of different post-glacial ages. The location-dependent community composition was equally diverse in both the initial and later stages of succession, suggesting that successional time could alter the effects of microtopography on the fungal community. Moreover, our results suggest that fungal communities at different locations follow different successional trajectories, even if they have passed through the same time lapse. Such a synergistic effect of succession and microtopography of moraines does not allow for parallel changes in fungal communities among moraines or among locations, suggesting that the moraine series contributes substantially to fungal spatial diversity in the glacier forefield.},

  TITLE = {New species of aquatic chytrids from Oman},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {112},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {Oman is a desert country in the south of the Middle East. Springs and other water sources that harbor aquatic organisms can be separated by hundreds of kilometers. In Oct 2019, we isolated four freshwater aquatic fungi (Chytridiomycota) from benthic detritus baited with pine pollen on a general nutrient medium near Salalah, Oman. Database queries of nuc 28S rRNA (28S) and internal transcribed spacer region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) revealed that one of these strains wasDinochytrium kinnereticum, a recently described algal pathogen from the Sea of Galilee. The other three strains had low molecular identity to available ITS sequences. These unknown strains varied in size and released endogenously swarming zoospores through papillae from mature zoosporangia. Zoospore ultrastructure was consistent with described species in the Rhizophydiales, and molecular phylogenetic results grouped these three strains into a clade in the genusRhizophydium. We circumscribe these three strains as a sp. nov., thereby expanding the diversity withinRhizophydiumdescribed as the new speciesR. jobii. In doing so, we provide the first report of Chytridiomycota from Oman.},

  TITLE = {Keratinase production by newly isolated antarctic actinomycete strains},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {21},
  YEAR = {2005},
  ABSTRACT = {The ability of actinomycete strains newly isolated from Antarctic soils to produce keratinolytic enzymes during growth on sheep wool waste was investigated. The strains which displayed highest keratinase activity and identified as Streptomyces flavis 2BG (mesophilic) and Microbispora aerata IMBAS-11A (thermophilic) were selected for a more detailed analysis. The addition of starch to the growth medium affected keratinase secretion by both strains. After 5 days of cultivation, a 6-fold increase in keratinase activity of strain 11A was observed in the presence of 11 g starch/l and a 9-fold increase in keratinase activity of the strain 2BG in the presence of 5 g starch/l. The results obtained showed that both newly isolated strains are very promising for effective processing of native keratinous wastes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Antarctic actinomycete strains that were able to grow on keratin-containing wastes by producing keratinolytic enzymes.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {23},
  YEAR = {2010},
  ABSTRACT = {In Iceland, extensive afforestation programmes have been initiated, often involving the outplanting of nursery seedling stock on eroded land. In some areas high seedling mortality, to a large extent due to root damage caused by Otiorhynchus spp. larvae, has been reported. Even though recent studies have shown that inoculation with entomopathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi may reduce the effects of Otiorhynchus spp. on seedling mortality, information on the occurrence and distribution of these key fungal species in Icelandic soils is limited. The present study reports findings of a targeted survey on the occurrence and distribution of entomopathogenic fungi and birch (Betula pubescens) root symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in Icelandic soils from key habitats representing birch woodland, heathland and degraded/eroded land. Entomopathogenic fungi were isolated from soil by baiting with Tenebrio molitor and Galleria mellonella larvae. Identification to species was achieved based on standard morphotyping of cultures that included conidiophores and conidia. Birch seedling root symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungal distribution in eroded and birch woodland soil was determined following baiting with birch seedlings over 9 months and classification based on gross morphology. Significant lower frequency and diversity of both entomopathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi were detected in soil collected from eroded areas compared to soil from vegetated areas (birch and heathland). Three species of entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae and Isaria farinosa were present in soil samples collected from the birch woodland and heathland sites. In contrast, no insect pathogenic fungi were found in soil collected from the eroded sites. B. bassiana and M. anisopliae were recorded for the first time in Iceland. The incidence of mycorrhizal root tips was higher on seedlings grown in soil from birch woodland than in soil from eroded land and a higher diversity of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was found in birch soil. The importance of these findings is discussed in relation to afforestation in Iceland.},

  TITLE = {Genomic characterization of three marine fungi, including Emericellopsis atlantica sp. nov. with signatures of a generalist lifestyle and marine biomass degradation},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {12},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {Marine fungi remain poorly covered in global genome sequencing campaigns; the 1000 fungal genomes (1KFG) project attempts to shed light on the diversity, ecology and potential industrial use of overlooked and poorly resolved fungal taxa. This study characterizes the genomes of three marine fungi: Emericellopsis sp. TS7, wood-associated Amylocarpus encephaloides and algae-associated Calycina marina. These species were genome sequenced to study their genomic features, biosynthetic potential and phylogenetic placement using multilocus data. Amylocarpus encephaloides and C. marina were placed in the Helotiaceae and Pezizellaceae (Helotiales), respectively, based on a 15-gene phylogenetic analysis. These two genomes had fewer biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) than Emericellopsis sp. TS7 isolate. Emericellopsis sp. TS7 (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) was isolated from the sponge Stelletta normani. A six-gene phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in the marine Emericellopsis clade and morphological examination confirmed that the isolate represents a new species, which is described here as E. atlantica. Analysis of its CAZyme repertoire and a culturing experiment on three marine and one terrestrial substrates indicated that E. atlantica is a psychrotrophic generalist fungus that is able to degrade several types of marine biomass. FungiSMASH analysis revealed the presence of 35 BGCs including, eight non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), six NRPS-like, six polyketide synthases, nine terpenes and six hybrid, mixed or other clusters. Of these BGCs, only five were homologous with characterized BGCs. The presence of unknown BGCs sets and large CAZyme repertoire set stage for further investigations of E. atlantica. The Pezizellaceae genome and the genome of the monotypic Amylocarpus genus represent the first published genomes of filamentous fungi that are restricted in their occurrence to the marine habitat and form thus a valuable resource for the community that can be used in studying ecological adaptions of fungi using comparative genomics.},

  ABSTRACT = {Eighteen taxa of terrestrial predacious fungi (nematode-trapping species and endozoic parasites of nematodes) are reported from the maritime Antarctic (15 taxa from Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, and 10 taxa from Galindez Island, Argentine Islands {[}Monacrosporium ellipsosporum (Preuss), (Grove), Cooke and Dickinson, M. cionopagum (Drechsler), (Subramanian), Cooke and Dickinson, M. lypsipagum (Drechsler), Cooke and Dickinson, M. psychrophilum (Drechsler), Cooke and Dickinson, Dactylaria gracilis Duddington, D. candida (Nees), Sace, (Drechsler), Dactylella phymatopaga Drechsler, D. stenobrocha Drechsler, ?Cystopage lateralis Drechsler, Harposporium anguillulae (Lohde), Karling, H. oxycoracum Drechsler, H. lilliputanum Dixon, Meria coniospora Drechsler, Acrostalagmus obovatus Drechsler, Haptoglossa heterospora Dreschler, Cephalosporium balanoides Drechsler, unidentified species a and unidentified species b. {[}Of the 15 identified species only M. coniospora was previously confirmed from the Antarctic.] Fifteen are positively identified to species level, 12 of which have not previously been recorded in the Antarctic. They were isolated from several locally dominant moss species and soil associated with the 2 native phanerogams. Monacrosporium ellipsosporum and M. cionopagum were the most widely distributed trapping hypomycetes while Harposporium anguillulae was the most frequently occurring endozoic fungus. All taxa were isolated from cultures maintained at 18.5.degree. C but only 5 of these were recorded in cultures kept at 7.degree. C. Eight different trapping mechanisms were recorded with adhesive knobs being the commonest structure. The relationship between fungal taxon and moss species or soil type is discussed. Although several species were recorded only in single samples M. ellipsosporum appeared associated with calcicolous mosses. M. cionopagum and H. anguillulae have comparatively wide ecological amplitudes. No nematophagous fungi were isolated from permanently saturated moss carpets or from the strongly acidic turf-forming Polytrichaceae. The possible importance of these fungi in the energy dynamics and their influence on nematode populations of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems is considered.},

  TITLE = {Trace element, rare earth element and trace carbon compounds in Subglacial Lake Whillans, West Antarctica},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {892},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {Whillans Subglacial Lake (SLW) lies beneath 801 m of ice in the lower portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part of an extensive and active subglacial drainage network. Here, the geochemical characterization of SLW rare earth elements (REE), trace elements (TE), free amino acids (FAA), and phenolic compounds (PC) measured in lakewater and sediment porewater are reported. The results show, on average, higher values of REEs in the lakewater than in the porewater, and clear changes in all REE concentrations and select redox sensitive trace element concentrations in porewaters at a depth of similar to 15 cm in the 38 cm lake sediment core. This is consistent with prior results on the lake sediment redox conditions based on gas chemistry and microbiological data. Low concentrations of vanillyl phenols were measured in the SLW water column with higher concentrations in porewater samples and their concentration profiles in the sediments may also reflect changing redox conditions in the sediments. Vanillin concentrations increased with depth in the sediments as oxygenation decreases, while the concentrations of vanillic acid, the more oxidized component, were higher in the more oxygenated surface sediments. Collectively these results indicate redox changes occurring with the upper 38 cm of sediment in SLW and provide support for the existence of a seawater source, already hypothesized, in the sediments below the lowest measured depth, and of a complex and dynamic geochemical system beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Our results are the first to detail geochemical properties from an Antarctic subglacial environment using direct sampling technology. Due to their isolation from the wider environment, subglacial lakes represent one of our planets last pristine environments that provide habitats for microbial life and natural biogeochemical cycles but also impact the basal hydrology and can cause ice flow variations.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {6},
  YEAR = {2013},
  ABSTRACT = {Cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces are ice-cold hot spots of microbial diversity and activity but still little is known about their fungal inhabitants. We provide the first report of distinctive fungal communities in cryoconite debris from three valley glaciers at Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Multivariate analysis of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of rRNA ITS amplicons revealed that quite distinct fungal communities were found in cryoconite holes compared with soils from adjacent moraine and tundra sites, and that communities on glaciers with contrasting ice-surface hydrology also differed. Most of the fungi cultured from cryoconite sediment were basidiomycetous yeasts or filamentous Ascomycota (Helotiales/Pleosporales). The latter included aeroaquatic fungi, such as Articulospora and Varicosporium, implying a role for these important freshwater decomposers in the carbon dynamics of cryoconite holes. Matching of the dominant peaks from T-RFLP analysis to predicted peaks of cultured isolates confirmed the abundance of these aeroaquatic fungi but also revealed that most of the dominant T-RFLP peaks did not match any cultured isolates. Considering the prevalence and endangerment of glacial environments worldwide, these findings would suggest that their potential as reservoirs of fungal diversity should not be overlooked.

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {14},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {Microbial communities inhabiting the Antarctic Ocean show psychrophilic and halophilic adaptations conferring interesting properties to the enzymes they produce, which could be exploited in biotechnology and bioremediation processes. Use of cold- and salt-tolerant enzymes allows to limit costs, reduce contaminations, and minimize pretreatment steps. Here, we report on the screening of 186 morphologically diverse microorganisms isolated from marine biofilms and water samples collected in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) for the identification of new laccase activities. After primary screening, 13.4 and 10.8\% of the isolates were identified for the ability to oxidize 2,2 `-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and the dye azure B, respectively. Amongst them, the marine Halomonas sp. strain M68 showed the highest activity. Production of its laccase-like activity increased six-fold when copper was added to culture medium. Enzymatic activity-guided separation coupled with mass spectrometry identified this intracellular laccase-like protein (named Ant laccase) as belonging to the copper resistance system multicopper oxidase family. Ant laccase oxidized ABTS and 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, working better at acidic pHs The enzyme showed a good thermostability, with optimal temperature in the 40-50 degrees C range and maintaining more than 40\% of its maximal activity even at 10 degrees C. Furthermore, Ant laccase was salt- and organic solvent-tolerant, paving the way for its use in harsh conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report concerning the characterization of a thermo- and halo-tolerant laccase isolated from a marine Antarctic bacterium.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {16},

  ABSTRACT = {The dictyostelids (also called cellular slime molds or social amoebae) are among the more abundant and widespread groups of microorganisms in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this fact, they are totally unknown to most people, who sometimes confuse the dictyostelids with myxomycetes (or plasmodial slime molds). The first dictyostelid (Dictyostelium mucoroides) was described by the German Oskar Brefeld in 1869. More than 180 species are now known, and these organisms have been recorded from the high arctic to the subantarctic. The primary microhabitat for dictyostelids is the soil/humus layer on a forest floor, but they also occur in a number of other microhabitats. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of dictyostelids, including their occurrence, distribution, relationships with other organisms, methods used for isolation, history of their study, and classification. The assemblages of species associated with each major type of ecosystem (tropical forest, temperate forest, boreal forest, tundra, grassland, savanna, and desert) are described. In addition, the compounds produced by dictyostelids and their possible applications are discussed.},

  TITLE = {Proteomic characterization of Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolates from polar and temperate regions},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {116},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {Proteomics has been used extensively in the field of mycology, mainly in trying to understand the complex network of protein-protein interactions that has been implicated in the molecular functions of fungi. It is also a useful tool to compare metabolic differences within a genus. Species of Pseudogymnoascus, a genus under the phyla Ascomycota, have been shown to play an important role in the soil environment. They have been found in both polar and temperate regions and are a known producer of many extracellular hydrolases that contribute to soil decomposition. Despite the apparent importance of Pseudogymnoascus spp. in the soil ecosystem, investigations into their molecular functions are still very limited. In the present study, proteomic characterization of six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolated from three biogeographic regions (the Arctic, Antarctic, and temperate regions) was carried out using tandem mass spectrometry. Prior to proteomic analysis, the optimization for protein extraction was carried out. Trichloroacetic acid-acetone-phenol was found to be the best extraction method to be used for proteomic profiling of Pseudogymnoascus spp. The proteomic analysis identified 2003 proteins that were successfully mapped to the UniProtKB database. The identified proteins were clustered according to their biological processes and molecular functions. The shared proteins found in all Pseudogymnoascus spp. (1201 proteins) showed a significantly close relationship in their basic cellular functions, despite differences in morphological structures. Analysis of Pseudogymnoascus spp. proteome also identified proteins that were unique to each region. However, a high number of these proteins belonged to protein families of similar molecular functions, namely, transferases and hydrolases. Our proteomic data can be used as a reference for Pseudogymnoascus spp. across different global regions and a foundation for future soil ecosystem function research.},

  ABSTRACT = {Purpose The ecological importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in plant acquisition of inorganic and organic sources of nitrogen (N) is not clear. To improve understanding of the plant N nutrition ecology, we tested the effect of intraspecific competition and AMF in plant N source use in growth and N acquisition. Methods Solidago virgaurea was grown in microcosms in a fully factorial experiment under greenhouse conditions. The factors tested were intraspecific competition between seedlings and adult plants (yes, no), N source (NH4, glycine) and AMF (inoculated with Glomus hoi, not inoculated). Results When grown separately, non-mycorrhizal seedling growth was highest when grown with ammonium, but non-mycorrhizal adults grew best with glycine as the sole N source. Mycorrhizal symbiosis with Glomus hoi evened out this initial niche partitioning in terms of differences in N source use and all mycorrhizal plants grew best with ammonium. Competition shaped plant benefit from mycorrhizal symbiosis depending on the N source. Competition reduced mycorrhizal growth benefit in glycine-grown seedlings, but not in adults. Plant performance did not show uniform relationship with delta N-15, but delta N-15 was affected by life stage, competition and mycorrhiza. Conclusions Plant competition and AMF shape plant N source use. Plant and AMF benefit of the symbiosis depend on the N source.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {82},
  YEAR = {2012},
  ABSTRACT = {This study assessed the diversity and distribution of filamentous fungi obtained from water sampled from six lakes in the Antarctic Peninsula. One hundred and twenty-eight fungal isolates were purified and identified by analysis of nuclear rDNA ITS region sequences as belonging to 31 fungal different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most frequently isolated fungi were Geomyces pannorum and Mortierella sp.; these species occurred in six and three of the lakes sampled, respectively, and displayed the highest total colony-forming unit per L. Different species that have not been found to these lakes and/or had adapted to cold conditions were found. In general, the fungal community displayed low richness and high dominance indices. The species Cadophora cf. luteo-olivacea, Cadophora malorum, Davidiella tassiana, G.pannorum, Mortierella cf. alpina and Thelebolus cf. microsporus that were found in the lakes in question were also previously found in other cold ecosystems, such as Arctic, temperate and Alpine regions. The results of this study suggest the presence of an interesting aquatic fungal web, including symbionts, weak and strong saprophytes and parasite/pathogen fungal species. This aquatic web fungal may be a useful community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies of extreme habitats.},

  TYPE = {Article; Proceedings Paper},
  VOLUME = {63},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {Growing interest in understanding the relevance of marine fungi to food webs, biogeochemical cycling, and biological patterns necessitates establishing a context for interpreting future findings. To help establish this context, we summarize the diversity of cultured and observed marine planktonic fungi from across the world. While exploring this diversity, we discovered that only half of the known marine fungal species have a publicly available DNA locus, which we hypothesize will likely hinder accurate highthroughput sequencing classification in the future, as it does currently. Still, we reprocessed >600 high-throughput datasets and analyzed 4.9 x 10(9) sequences (4.8 x 10(9) shotgun metagenomic reads and 1.0 x 10(8) amplicon sequences) and found that every fungal phylum is represented in the global marine planktonic mycobiome; however, this mycobiome is generally predominated by three phyla: the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Chytridiomycota. We hypothesize that these three clades are the most abundant due to a combination of evolutionary histories, as well as physical processes that aid in their dispersal. We found that environments with atypical salinity regimes (>5 standard deviations from the global mean: Red Sea, Baltic Sea, sea ice) hosted higher proportions of the Chytridiomycota, relative to open oceans that are dominated by Dikarya. The Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea had the highest fungal richness of all areas explored. An analysis of similarity identified significant differences between oceanographic regions. There were no latitudinal gradients of marine fungal richness and diversity observed. As more high-throughput sequencing data become available, expanding the collection of reference loci and genomes will be essential to understanding the ecology of marine fungi.},

  ABSTRACT = {Bacterial growth at low pressure is a new research area with implications for predicting microbial activity in clouds and the bulk atmosphere on Earth, and for modeling the forward contamination of planetary surfaces like Mars. Here, we describe experiments on the recovery and identification of 23 species of bacterial hypobarophiles (def., growth under hypobaric conditions of approximately 1-2 kPa) in 11 genera capable of growth at 0.7 kPa. Hypobarophilic bacteria, but not archaea or fungi, were recovered from soil and non-soil ecosystems. The highest numbers of hypobarophiles were recovered from Arctic soil, Siberian permafrost, and human saliva. Isolates were identified through 16S rRNA sequencing to belong to the genera Carnobacterium, Exiguobacterium, Leuconostoc, Paenibacillus, and Trichococcus. The highest population of culturable hypobarophilic bacteria (5.1 x 10(4) cfu/g) was recovered from Colour Lake soils from Axel Heiberg Island in the Canadian Arctic. In addition, we extend the number of hypobarophilic species in the genus Serratia to six type-strains that include S. ficaria, S. fonticola, S. grimesii, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, and S. quinivorans. Microbial growth at 0.7 kPa suggests that pressure alone will not be growth-limiting on the martian surface or in Earth's atmosphere up to an altitude of 34 km.},

  TITLE = {Increasing aridity reduces soil microbial diversity and abundance in global drylands},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {112},
  YEAR = {2015},
  ABSTRACT = {Soil bacteria and fungi play key roles in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, yet our understanding of their responses to climate change lags significantly behind that of other organisms. This gap in our understanding is particularly true for drylands, which occupy similar to 41\% of Earth ` s surface, because no global, systematic assessments of the joint diversity of soil bacteria and fungi have been conducted in these environments to date. Here we present results from a study conducted across 80 dryland sites from all continents, except Antarctica, to assess how changes in aridity affect the composition, abundance, and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi. The diversity and abundance of soil bacteria and fungi was reduced as aridity increased. These results were largely driven by the negative impacts of aridity on soil organic carbon content, which positively affected the abundance and diversity of both bacteria and fungi. Aridity promoted shifts in the composition of soil bacteria, with increases in the relative abundance of Chloroflexi and alpha-Proteobacteria and decreases in Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Contrary to what has been reported by previous continental and global-scale studies, soil pH was not a major driver of bacterial diversity, and fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota. Our results fill a critical gap in our understanding of soil microbial communities in terrestrial ecosystems. They suggest that changes in aridity, such as those predicted by climate-change models, may reduce microbial abundance and diversity, a response that will likely impact the provision of key ecosystem services by global drylands.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {46},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Aim Polar and alpine ecosystems appear to be particularly sensitive to increasing temperatures and the altered precipitation patterns linked to climate change. However, little is currently known about how these environmental drivers may affect edaphic organisms within these ecosystems. In this study, we examined communities of plant root-associated fungi (RAF) over large biogeographical scales and along climatic gradients in the North Atlantic region in order to gain insights into the potential effects of climate variability on these communities. We also investigated whether selected fungal traits were associated with particular climates. Locations Austria, Scotland, Mainland Norway, Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Taxa Root fungi associated with the ectomycorrhizal and herbaceous plant Bistorta vivipara. Methods DNA metabarcoding of the ITS1 region was used to characterize the RAF of 302 whole plant root systems, which were analysed by means of ordination methods and linear modelling. Fungal spore length, width, volume and shape, as well as mycelial exploration type (ET) of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes were summarized at a community level. Results The RAF communities exhibited strong biogeographical structuring, and both compositional variation as well as fungal species richness correlated with annual temperature and precipitation. In accordance with general island biogeography theory, the least species-rich RAF communities were found on Jan Mayen, a remote and small island in the North Atlantic Ocean. Fungal spores tended to be more elongated with increasing latitude. We also observed a climate effect on which mycelial ET was dominating among the ectomycorrhizal fungi. Main conclusions Both geographical and environmental variables were important for shaping root-associated fungal communities at a North Atlantic scale, including the High Arctic. Fungal OTU richness followed general biogeographical patterns and decreased with decreasing size and/or increasing isolation of the host plant population. The probability of possessing more elongated spores increases with latitude, which may be explained by a selection for greater dispersal capacity among more isolated host plant populations in the Arctic.},

  TITLE = {An Antarctic Hot Spot for Fungi at Shackleton's Historic Hut on Cape Royds},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {60},
  YEAR = {2010},
  ABSTRACT = {The historic expedition huts located in the Ross Sea Region of the Antarctic and the thousands of artifacts left behind by the early explorers represent important cultural heritage from the ``Heroic Era{''} of Polar exploration. The hut at Cape Royds built by Ernest Shackleton and members of the 1907-1908 British Antarctic Expedition has survived the extreme Antarctic environment for over 100 years, but recent studies have shown many forms of deterioration are causing serious problems, and microbial degradation is evident in the historic wood. Conservation work to reduce moisture at the hut required removal of fodder, wood, and many different types of organic materials from the stables area on the north side of the structure allowing large numbers of samples to be obtained for these investigations. In addition, wood from historic food storage boxes exposed in a ravine adjacent to the hut were also sampled. Fungi were cultured on several different media, and pure cultures were obtained and identified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA. From the 69 cultures of filamentous fungi obtained, the most predominant genera were Cadophora (44\%) followed by Thielavia (17\%) and Geomyces (15\%). Other fungi found included Cladosporium, Chaetomium, and isolates identified as being in Pezizomycotina, Onygenales, Nectriaceae, and others. No filamentous basidiomycetes were found. Phylogenetic analyses of the Cadophora species showed great species diversity present revealing Cadophora malorum, Cadophora luteo-olivacea, Cadophora fastigiata, as well as Cadophora sp. 4E71-1, a C. malorum-like species, and Cadophora sp. 7R16-1, a C. fastigiata-like species. Scanning electron microscopy showed extensive decay was present in the wood samples with type 1 and type 2 forms of soft rot evident in pine and birch wood, respectively. Fungi causing decay in the historic wooden structures and artifacts are of great concern, and this investigation provides insight into the identity and species diversity of fungi found at the site. The historic woods and other organic materials at this site represent a large input of carbon into the Antarctic environment. This as well as nutrient additions from the nearby Ad,lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony and favorable conditions for fungal growth at Cape Royds appear responsible for the significant fungal diversity, and where extensive decay is taking place in wood in contact with the ground.},

  ABSTRACT = {Here we present the first culture-independent microbiological and biogeochemical study of the mineral soils from 6000 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.) on some the highest volcanoes in the Atacama region of Argentina and Chile. These soils experience some of the harshest environmental conditions on Earth including daily temperature fluctuations across the freezing point (with an amplitude of up to 70 degrees C) and intense solar radiation. Soil carbon and water levels are among the lowest yet measured for a terrestrial ecosystem and enzyme activity was near or below detection limits for all microbial enzymes measured. The soil microbial communities were among the simplest yet studied in a terrestrial environment and contained novel Bacteria and Fungi and only one Archaeal phylotype. No photosynthetic organisms were detected but several of the dominant bacterial phylotypes are related to organisms involved in carbon monoxide oxidation on other volcanoes (e.g., Pseudonocardia and Ktedonobacter spp.). Focused studies of a gene responsible for carbon monoxide oxidation, the large subunit of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (coxL of CODH), revealed several novel lineages and a broad diversity of coxL genes. Overall our results suggest that a unique microbial community, sustained by diffuse atmospheric and volcanic gases, is barely functioning on these volcanoes, which represent the highest terrestrial ecosystems yet studied.},

  TITLE = {Temporal Changes in Soil Bacterial Diversity and Humic Substances Degradation in Subarctic Tundra Soil},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {69},
  YEAR = {2015},
  ABSTRACT = {Humic substances (HS), primarily humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), are the largest constituent of soil organic matter. In microcosm systems with subarctic HS-rich tundra soil (site AK 1-75; approximately 5.6 A degrees C during the thawing period) from Council, Alaska, the HA content significantly decreased to 48 \% after a 99-day incubation at 5 A degrees C as part of a biologically mediated process. Accordingly, levels of FA, a putative byproduct of HA degradation, consistently increased to 172 \% during an identical incubation process. Culture-independent microbial community analysis showed that during the microcosm experiments, the relative abundance of phyla Proteobacteria (bacteria) and Euryarchaeota (archaea) largely increased, indicating their involvement in HS degradation. When the indigenous bacteria in AK 1-75 were enriched in an artificial mineral medium spiked with HA, the changes in relative abundance were most conspicuous in Proteobacteria (from 60.2 to 79.0 \%), specifically Betaproteobacteria-related bacteria. One hundred twenty-two HA-degrading bacterial strains, primarily from the genera Paenibacillus (phylum Firmicutes) and Pseudomonas (class Gammaproteobacteria), were cultivated from AK 1-75 and nearby sites. Through culture-dependent analysis with these bacterial isolates, we observed increasing HS-degradation rates in parallel with rising temperatures in a range of 0 A degrees C to 20 A degrees C, with the most notable increase occurring at 8 A degrees C compared to 6 A degrees C. Our results indicate that, although microbial-mediated HS degradation occurs at temperature as low as 5 A degrees C in tundra ecosystems, increasing soil temperature caused by global climate change could enhance HS degradation rates. Extending the thawing period could also increase degradation activity, thereby directly affecting nearby microbial communities and rhizosphere environments.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {41},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {Here we investigate the microbiomes of the soil samples from the Yamal Peninsula (the surroundings of Salekhard city, Russian Federation) using a high-throughput sequencing approach. The main goal was to investigate the impact of mining on soils within the following regeneration, both during the reclamation practice and natural self-growth. Several quarries were studied, engaged in sand, clay and chromatic ores mining. The taxonomic analysis of the soil microbiomes revealed 50 bacterial and archaeal phyla; among the dominant phyla were: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chroloflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, AD3, and Nitrospirae. Compared to the typical tundra soil, which was chosen as a control, the disturbed soils had increased biodiversity and total counts for soil bacteria, archaea, and fungi, especially in the cryosolic horizon. The different mining strategies caused significantly different transformations of soil microbiomes, which was less pronounced for self-growth compared to reclaimed quarries. This isolation of the reclaimed quarry was mainly associated with the increase of the amount of acidobacteria (fam. Koribacteraceae and Acidobacteriaceae and order Ellin6513), some proteohacterial taxa (lam. Syntrophobacteraceae), and Chlorollexi (fam. Thennogeintnatisporaceae). The study also revealed bacteria, which tend to be specific for marine tundra environments: gemmatinionadetes from the order N1473WL and Chlorotlexi bacteria from the order Gitt-GS-136.},

  TITLE = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in sandy soils in Iceland},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {34},
  YEAR = {2002},
  ABSTRACT = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were extracted from samples of eight different sites of sandy soils in Iceland. Eleven species of AMF were identified directly from original soil samples or trap culture using the host plant Allium porrum. Six AMF species were successfully subcultured in pots with the host plant Plantago lanceolata. Species from four genera of the order Glomerales (Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Glomus, and Scutellospora) were identified. The AMF species identified from subcultured pots included Glomus hoi, G. clarum, and a species of Scutellospora resembling S. dipurpurascens. Three other, as yet unidentified, species of Glomus were also isolated. AMF root colonization was estimated on Leymus arenarius (lymegrass), the main dune-building grass in Iceland during the growing season. Total AMF root colonization did not depend upon the season. However, percentage root colonization of arbuscules was significantly highest in July, indicating the highest peak of functional AMF activity. This survey of AMF is the first conducted in Iceland. The importance of this work is discussed in relation to occurrence of AMF species in polar regions and in relation to sand dune reclamation.},

  TITLE = {Conifer Root Nodules Colonized by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Jurassic Geothermal Settings from Patagonia, Argentina},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {181},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {Premise of research. Despite the ecological significance of arbuscular mycorrhizae in modern terrestrial ecosystems, knowledge about their evolution based on the fossil record is still scarce, especially concerning the case of root nodules harboring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, as in some extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. Exceptionally preserved conifer nodular roots were found in the Jurassic fossil-bearing chert deposits of the Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz, Argentina), raising the possibility of studying them in association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The aim of this study is to describe the plant organs and their fungal partners and to discuss the ecological significance of the interactions observed, particularly with respect to their occurrence in the hot spring settings. Methodology. Thin sections of chert samples from the Canadon Nahuel locality of the La Matilde Formation, Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz, Argentina) were observed using light microscopy. Pivotal results. The cortex of the nodules is occupied by several glomeromycotan fungal structures. The structures occur in a specific zone of the cortex-toward its center-and include intracellular hyphal coils and arbuscules. Glomoid spores and coenocytic hyphae possibly penetrating the epidermal cells are also described and analyzed. Conclusions. The root nodules have affinities with the Araucariales, representing the oldest record of such structures for this conifer clade. This is also the first record of nodules harboring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for the Jurassic; it extends our knowledge of the fossil record for this particular type of fungal association.},

  ABSTRACT = {While a vast number of studies have addressed the prokaryotic diversity in permafrost, characterized by subzero temperatures, low water activity, and extremely low rates of nutrient and metabolite transfer, fungal patterns have received surprisingly limited attention. Here, the fungal diversity and community structure were investigated by culture-dependent technique combined with cloning-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of sediments in a 10-m-long permafrost core from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. A total of 62 fungal phylotypes related to 10 distinct classes representing three phyla were recovered from 5031 clones generated in 13 environmental gene libraries. A large proportion of the phylotypes (25/62) that were distantly related to described fungal species appeared to be novel diversity. Ascomycota was the predominant group of fungi, with respect to both clone and phylotype number. Our results suggested there was the existence of cosmopolitan psychrophilic or psychrotolerant fungi in permafrost sediments, the community composition of fungi varied with increasing depth, while these communities largely distributed according to core layers.},

  TITLE = {Identifying Functional Impacts of Heat-Resistant Fungi on Boreal Forest Recovery After Wildfire},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {3},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {Fungi play key roles in carbon (C) dynamics of ecosystems: saprotrophs decompose organic material and return C in the nutrient cycle, and mycorrhizal species support plants that accumulate C through photosynthesis. The identities and functions of extremophile fungi present after fire can influence C dynamics, particularly because plant-fungal relationships are often species-specific. However, little is known about the function and distribution of fungi that survive fires. We aim to assess the distribution of heat-resistant soil fungi across burned stands of boreal forest in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and understand their functions in relation to decomposition and tree seedling growth. We cultured and identified fungi from heat-treated soils and linked sequences from known taxa with high throughput sequencing fungal data (Illumina MiSeq, ITS1) from soils collected in 47 plots. We assessed functions under controlled conditions by inoculating litter and seedlings with heat-resistant fungi to assess decomposition and effects on seedling growth, respectively, for black spruce (Picea mariana), birch (Betula papyrifera), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana). We also measured litter decomposition rates and seedling densities in the field without inoculation. We isolated seven taxa of heat-resistant fungi and found their relative abundances were not associated with environmental or fire characteristics. Under controlled conditions,Fayodia gracilipesandPenicillium arenicoladecomposed birch, but no taxa decomposed black spruce litter significantly more than the control treatment. Seedlings showed reduced biomass and/or mortality when inoculated with at least one of the fungal taxa.Penicillium turbatumreduced growth and/or caused mortality of all three species of seedlings. In the field, birch litter decomposed faster in stands with greater pre-fire proportion of black spruce, while black spruce litter decomposed faster in stands experiencing longer fire-free intervals. Densities of seedlings that had germinated since fire were positively associated with ectomycorrhizal richness while there were fewer conifer seedlings with greater heat-resistant fungal abundance. Overall, our study suggests that extremophile fungi present after fires have multiple functions and may have unexpected negative effects on forest functioning and regeneration. In particular, heat-resistant fungi after fires may promote shifts away from conifer dominance that are observed in these boreal forests.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {61},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {We documented relative growth rates (RGRs) and activities of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes (EHEs) of one marine-derived tropical strain of Fusarium equiseti originally isolated from Malaysia and two polar strains of Pseudogymnoascus spp. from the Arctic and Antarctic under various temperatures and different nutrient conditions. RGRs and relative enzyme activities (RAs) of protease, amylase and cellulase were screened in seawater nutrient assay plates augmented with either skim milk, soluble starch or carboxymethylcellulose with trypan blue, respectively, across culture temperatures between 5 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Measures of RGR were fitted into third-degree polynomial and Briere-2 temperature-dependent models to estimate optimum temperatures for growth (T-opt) and maximum growth rates (RGR(max)), and were used to calculate temperature coefficients (Q(10)) and activation energies (E-a) for growth. All studied strains showed highest RGR and RA when grown using a skim milk nutrient assay. T-opt for growth was 25 degrees C in F. equiseti and 20 degrees C in Pseudogymnoascus spp. Only F. equiseti showed cellulase activity. These data suggest a preference for protein-based substrates over plant-derived substrates for metabolism in these fungal strains. The tropical F. equiseti could utilise higher levels of thermal energy for growth than the polar strains of Pseudogymnoascus spp., implying adaptation of these fungi to different bioclimatic regions.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {17},
  YEAR = {2013},
  ABSTRACT = {To move beyond targeted approaches to the biochemical characterization of psychrophilic yeast and provide a more holistic understanding of the chemistry of physiological adaptation of psychrophiles at the molecular level, ultraperformance liquid chromatography combined with simultaneous acquisition of low- and high-collision energy mass spectra (UPLC/MSe) was employed for a preliminary comparative analysis of cell extracts of psychrophilic Antarctic yeasts Cryptococcus vishniacii CBS 10616 and Dioszegia cryoxerica CBS 10919 versus the mesophile Saccharomyces cerevisiae `cry havoc'. A detailed workflow for providing high-confidence preliminary identifications of psychrophilic yeast-specific molecular features is presented. Preliminary identifications of psychrophile-specific features in C. vishniacii and D. cryoxerica determined with the described method include the glycerophospholipids lysophosphatidylcholine 18:2, lysophosphatidylcholine 18:3, lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:3, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:2. In addition, levels of guanosine diphosphate appear significantly elevated in cell extracts of the psychrophilic yeasts as compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Finally, five psychrophilic yeast-specific peptides have been discovered. All of these are demonstrated to be glycine- and/or proline-rich, a known structural characteristic of many naturally occurring bioactive peptides. The potential of this untargeted metabolite profiling approach as a tool for knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation in the study of biodiversity and microbial adaptation is highlighted.},

  YEAR = {2005},
  ABSTRACT = {Microorganisms were isolated from lignite freshly excavated in the Zahorie coal mine (southwestern Slovakia) under conditions excluding contamination with either soil or air-borne microorganisms. The isolates represented both Prokarya and Eukarya (fungi). All were able to grow on standard media, although some microorganisms were unstable and became extinct during storage of coal samples. Bacteria belonged to the genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Rhodococcus, according to both morphological criteria and ITS sequences. Several bacterial isolates were resistant to antibiotics. The presence of anaerobic bacteria was also documented, although they have not yet been identified. Fungal isolates were typified by using their ITS sequences. They belonged to the genera Trichoderma (Hypocrea), Penicillium, Epicoccum, Metarhizium (Cordyceps), and Cladosporium. Several fungi produced compounds with antibiotic action against standard bacterial strains. The evidence for the presence of microorganisms in native lignite was obtained by means of fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electron microprobe analysis. Results demonstrated that microorganisms were able to survive in the low-rank coal over a long time period. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Some of the coldest and driest permafrost soils on Earth are located in the high-elevation McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica, but little is known about the permafrost microbial communities other than that microorganisms are present in these valleys. Here, we describe the microbiology and habitable conditions of highly unique dry and ice-cemented permafrost in University Valley, one of the coldest and driest regions in the MDVs (1700 m above sea level; mean temperature -23 degrees C; no degree days above freezing), where the ice in permafrost originates from vapour deposition rather than liquid water. We found that culturable and total microbial biomass in University Valley was extremely low, and microbial activity under ambient conditions was undetectable. Our results contrast with reports from the lower-elevation Dry Valleys and Arctic permafrost soils where active microbial populations are found, suggesting that the combination of severe cold, aridity, oligotrophy of University Valley permafrost soils severely limit microbial activity and survival.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {34},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {The Antarctic continent hosts heterogeneous regions, which are in general exposed to extreme conditions, mainly low temperatures. Thus, microorganisms that thrive in this environment are supposed to harbor a metabolic versatility of great biotechnological interest, which includes the production of cold-adapted enzymes. The present study aimed to investigate chitinase production by bacteria isolated from marine and terrestrial samples from the Maritime Antarctica. For this, a collection of 560 bacteria was evaluated. Seventy-three (13\%) isolates, belonging to 13 bacterial genera affiliated to Proteobacteria (6), Actinobacteria (4) and Firmicutes (3), were positive in preliminary assays, and twenty strains were further selected based on individual plate assays at 5 and 15 degrees C. These strains were identified such as Arthrobacter psychrochitiniphilus, Arthrobacter cryoconite and Curto bacterium luteum, all belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria. The best chitinase producer was A. psychrochitiniphilus 492, which showed 43.39 U/L in 80 h of incubation. After optimization of nine independent variables by Plackett-Burman experimental design, followed by a fractional factorial (25-1) and a central composite design (CCD) 23, the best condition for chitinase production was achieved using yeast extract 1.0 g/L, NH4NO3 2.0 g/L, colloidal chitin 5.0\% and initial pH 6.0, which allowed an increase of 7.7-fold in chitinase production as compared with the initial condition without optimiza tion. Results gathered herein reinforce the Antarctic environment as a rich source for chitinase prospecting and open perspectives for further optimization strategies aiming future biotechnological application of such molecules in ecologically-friendly and sustainable processes.},

  VOLUME = {95},
  YEAR = {2003},
  ABSTRACT = {We molecularly assesed the ascomycetous fungal communities inhabiting the rhizoid environment of Cephaloziella varians, collected at Rothera Point on the western Antarctic Peninsula. The RFLP-phenotyped and cloned PCR products of a partial small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene were sequenced and analyzed with neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP). Both analyses identified four bootstrap-supported groups: (i) a sister group to Onygenales, (ii) a well-supported clade with Phialocephala fortinii, (iii) a large group of clones nested within Chaetothyriales, and (iv) a group nested within Eurotiales with a likely affinity to the genus Aspergillus. An additional marginally supported clade, including helotialean Hymenostyphus fructigenus, was detected in the NJ analysis. Placement of one clone (possibly helotialean) was not supported by either analysis. We included Hymenoscyphus ericae (Helotiales) in our analyses to test for its presence in clone libraries. None of our clones showed strongly supported affinity to H. ericae. The culture-independent technique proved useful for assessing the composition of rhizoid fungal communities, although it remains unknown whether any of these fungi colonize C varians tissues. Direct-community assays of this kind might be best combined with traditional isolation techniques to get a more holistic view of fungi occupying plant tissues.},

  ABSTRACT = {The main objective of the ongoing and future space exploration missions is the search for traces of extant or extinct life (biomarkers) on Mars. One of the main limiting factors on the survival of Earth-like life is the presence of harmful space radiation, that could damage or modify also biomolecules, therefore understanding the effects of radiation on terrestrial biomolecules stability and detectability is of utmost importance. Which terrestrial molecules could be preserved in a Martian radiation scenario? Here, we investigated the potential endurance of fungal biomolecules, by exposing de-hydrated colonies of the Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus mixed with Antarctic sandstone and with two Martian regolith analogues to increasing doses (0, 250 and 1000 Gy) of accelerated ions, namely iron (Fe), argon (Ar) and helium (He) ions. We analyzed the feasibility},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {57},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {Microbial biomass, diversity of culturable bacteria and micromycetes, and the number of functional nitrogen cycle genes in the supraglacial systems of the Aldegonda and Bertil glaciers have been studied. The biomass of microorganisms varies from 2.54 to 722 mu g/g substrate. It is shown for the first time that the major part (78.7-99.8\%) of microbial biomass in supraglacial objects is represented by fungi rather than by prokaryotes, and the main part (70 to 90\%) of the fungal biomass consists of mycelium with the length varying from 6.70 to 537.51 m/g substrate. The counts of prokaryotes vary from 2.4 x 10(8) to 1.95 x 10(9) cells/g substrate. The length of actinomycete mycelium falls into the range of 2.6-62.61 m/g substrate. The counts of culturable bacteria and actinomycetes vary from 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) CFU/g substrate and of micromycetes, from 2.2 x 10(1) to 1.7 x 10(4) CFU/g substrate. Bacteria of the genera Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and micromycetes of the genera Antarctomyces, Cadophora, Hyphozyma, Teberdinia and Thelebolus are dominants. The micromycetes Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Hyphozyma variabilis and Teberdinia hygrophila are found in Svalbard for the first time. The copy number of amoA genes in ammonium-oxidizing bacteria varies from 5.33 x 10(6) to 4.86 x 10(9)/g substrate; of nitrogen fixation genes nifH, from 9.89 x 10(7) to 9.81 x 10(10)/g substrate; and denitrification genes nirK, from 4.82 x 10(7) to 3.34 x 10(10)/g substrate. These results indirectly suggest the leading role of fungi in the microbiome of the supraglacial objects in Svalbard and a considerable contribution of prokaryotes to the emission of greenhouse gases there.},

  TITLE = {Tolerance of Rare-Earth Elements in Extremophile Fungus Umbelopsis isabellina from Polar Loparite Ore Tailings in Northwestern Russia},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {9},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {In this study, extremophile fungal species isolated from pure loparite-containing sands and their tolerance/resistance to the lanthanides Ce and Nd were investigated. The loparite-containing sands were collected at the tailing dumps of an enterprise developing a unique polar deposit of niobium, tantalum and rare-earth elements (REEs) of the cerium group: the Lovozersky Mining and Processing Plant (MPP), located in the center of the Kola Peninsula (northwestern Russia). From the 15 fungal species found at the site, one of the most dominant isolates was identified by molecular analysis as the zygomycete fungus Umbelopsis isabellina (GenBank accession no. OQ165236). Fungal tolerance/resistance was evaluated using different concentrations of CeCl3 and NdCl3. Umbelopsis isabellina exhibited a higher degree of tolerance/resistance to cerium and neodymium than did the other dominant isolates (Aspergillus niveoglaucus, Geomyces vinaceus and Penicillium simplicissimum). The fungus began to be inhibited only after being exposed to 100 mg L-1 of NdCl3. The toxic effects of Ce were not observed in fungus growth until it was subjected to 500 mg center dot L-1 of CeCl3. Moreover, only U. isabellina started to grow after extreme treatment with 1000 mg center dot L-1 of CeCl3 one month after inoculation. This work indicates, for the first time, the potential of Umbelopsis isabellina to remove REEs from the loparite ore tailings, making it a suitable candidate for the development of bioleaching methods.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {33},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Numerous studies have recognized a biogeographic boundary (i.e., Blakiston's Line) between Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan, where the Tsugaru Strait probably functions as a geographic barrier to the movement of terrestrial species. To clarify if this biogeographic boundary applies to soil microbes, we examined community structures of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi across the Tsugaru Strait. We sampled 266 soil cores from six conifer-dominated forests, and collected EM roots for fungal species identification based on internal transcribed spacer sequences. We found that EM fungal communities were primarily influenced by contemporary climate, but not significantly by the geographic barrier or spatial distance. Fungal OTUs appeared to be widespread in the Holarctic regions, suggesting long-distance dispersal capabilities or ancient migrations before the separation of Japanese islands from the continent. The significant effects of climate in this and previous studies imply that EM fungal communities may be sensitive to future climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

  TITLE = {Extreme overall mushroom genome expansion in Mycena s.s. irrespective of plant hosts or substrate specializations},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {4},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {Mycena s.s. is a ubiquitous mushroom genus whose members degrade multiple dead plant substrates and opportunistically invade living plant roots. Having sequenced the nuclear genomes of 24 Mycena species, we find them to defy the expected patterns for fungi based on both their traditionally perceived saprotrophic ecology and substrate specializations. Mycena displayed massive genome expansions overall affecting all gene families, driven by novel gene family emergence, gene duplications, enlarged secretomes encoding polysaccharide degradation enzymes, transposable element (TE) proliferation, and horizontal gene transfers. Mainly due to TE proliferation, Arctic Mycena species display genomes of up to 502 Mbp (2-83 3 the temperate Mycena), the largest among mushroom-forming Agaricomycetes, indicating a possible evolutionary convergence to genomic expansions sometimes seen in Arctic plants. Overall, Mycena show highly unusual, varied mosaic-like genomic structures adaptable to multiple lifestyles, providing genomic illustration for the growing realization that fungal niche adaptations can be far more fluid than traditionally believed.},

  YEAR = {2004},
  ABSTRACT = {Dark septate root endophytes (DSE) are an artificial assemblage of fungi that have darkly pigmented, septate hyphae and that are frequent or distinctive intracellular associates of roots of apparently healthy plants. Based oil isolates obtained from the roots of Salix spp., the distribution of a common DSE fungus, Phialocephala fortinii, was examined along a latitudinal transect in Canada running from the high arctic to the 49degrees N parallel. Non-sporulating isolates were provisionally identified as P.fortinii through analysis of DNA sequence data of the ITS2 region of rDNA. P. fortinii was isolated frequently from boreal and arctic habitats, but rarely from grassland habitats. Patterns of genetic variation were examined through analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). All AFLP profiles were unique with the majority of genetic variation occurring among individuals within the collecting sites at each latitude. Neighbour-joining analysis of genetic distances yielded eight well-supported clusters, three of which included individuals from more than one latitude. Some linkage disequilibrium, possibly due to partial clonality, was detected.},

  ABSTRACT = {To date over 1 000 non-lichenized fungal species have been recorded by collection or isolation from Antarctica, and additional taxa are now being identified by molecular studies. The number and variety of species recorded so far suggest that the fungi may be the most diverse biota in the Antarctic, and the additional taxa identified by molecular surveys suggest that the true diversity may be far greater than is currently estimated. Fungi occupy many different ecological niches in the Antarctic, and their significance in these niches is only poorly understood. The majority of species described from the region have been identified as members of broadly cosmopolitan groups, but there is some evidence for both endemic strains and populations. This review brings together the current broad systematic and ecological findings for the non-lichenized Antarctic fungi. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

  TITLE = {Temperature downshift induces antioxidant response in fungi isolated from Antarctica},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {13},
  YEAR = {2009},
  ABSTRACT = {Although investigators have been studying the cold-shock response in a variety of organisms for the last two decades or more, comparatively little is known about the difference between antioxidant cell response to cold stress in Antarctic and temperate microorganisms. The change of environmental temperature, which is one of the most common stresses, could be crucial for their use in the biotechnological industry and in ecological research. We compared the effect of short-term temperature downshift on antioxidant cell response in Antarctic and temperate fungi belonging to the genus Penicillium. Our study showed that downshift from an optimal temperature to 15A degrees or 6A degrees C led to a cell response typical of oxidative stress: significant reduction of biomass production; increase in the levels of oxidative damaged proteins and accumulation of storage carbohydrates (glycogen and trehalose) in comparison to growth at optimal temperature. Cell response against cold stress includes also increase in the activities of SOD and CAT, which are key enzymes for directly scavenging reactive oxygen species. This response is more species-dependent than dependent on the degree of cold-shock. Antarctic psychrotolerant strain Penicillium olsonii p14 that is adapted to life in extremely cold conditions demonstrated enhanced tolerance to temperature downshift in comparison with both mesophilic strains (Antarctic Penicillium waksmanii m12 and temperate Penicillium sp. t35).},

  TYPE = {Article; Early Access},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {Understanding the regeneration and succession of belowground communities, particularly in forests, is vital for maintaining ecosystem health. Despite its importance, there is limited knowledge regarding how fungal communities change over time during ecosystem development, especially under different forest restoration strategies. In this study, we focused on two restoration methods used in northern Japan: monoculture planting and natural regeneration. We examined the responses of the fungal community to monoculture plantations (active tree planting) and naturally regenerated (passive regeneration) forests over a 50-year chronosequence, using natural forests as a reference. Based on DNA metabarcoding, we assessed the richness of fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and their dissimilarity. Our findings revealed that soil fungal richness remained stable after natural regeneration but declined in monoculture plantations, from 354 to 247 OTUs. While the compositional dissimilarity of fungal assemblages between monoculture plantations and natural forests remained consistent regardless of the time since tree planting, it significantly decreased after natural regeneration, suggesting recovery to a state close to the reference level. Notably, the composition of key functional fungal groups-saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal- has increasingly mirrored that of natural forests over time following passive natural regeneration. In summary, our study suggests that monoculture plantations may not be effective for long-term ecosystem function and service recovery because of their limited support for soil fungal diversity. These results underscore the importance of natural regeneration in forest restoration and management strategies.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microbial communities in alpine environments >7,500 m.a.s.l. have not been well studied using modern cultivation-independent sequencing approaches due to the challenges and danger associated with reaching such high elevations. For this reason, we know little about the microorganisms found in sediments on Earth's tallest mountains, how they reach these surfaces, and how they survive and remain active at such extreme elevations. Here, we explore the microbial diversity recovered from three sediment samples collected from the South Col (similar to 7,900 m.a.s.l.) of Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) using both culturing and next generation sequencing approaches (16S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer {[}ITS] region, and 18S rRNA gene sequencing). Both approaches detected very low diversity of bacteria, protists, and fungi that included a combination of cosmopolitan taxa and specialized microorganisms often found at high elevations like those of the genera Modestobacter and Naganishia. Though we managed to grow viable cultures of many of these taxa, it remains likely that few, if any, can be active in situ at the South Col. Instead, these high-elevation surfaces may act as deep-freeze collection zones of organisms deposited from the atmosphere or left by climbers scaling the Earth's highest mountain.},

  TITLE = {Endolithic Fungal Diversity in Antarctic Oligocene Rock Samples Explored Using DNA Metabarcoding},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {13},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {Simple Summary We investigated the environmental DNA fungal diversity present in cores of Oligocene rocks from Antarctica using a DNA metabarcoding approach. After eDNA extraction and analysis, we identified 198 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycota, Rozellomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Zoopagomycota, Aphelidiomycota (Fungi), and the fungal-like Oomycota (Stramenopila). The dominant taxa detected were Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Aspergillaceae sp., and Diaporthaceae sp. We also detected 22 fungal ASVs as intermediate and 170 as minor components of the assigned fungal diversity. The samples displayed a high fungal diversity; however, rarefaction analysis suggested that further diversity remains to be detected. The endolithic fungal community detected contains a rich and complex mycobiome comprising taxa with different lifestyles, comparable to the diversity reported in other Antarctic habitats. Our results suggest the need for further research to develop strategies for isolating these fungi into culture for evolutionary, physiological, and biogeochemical studies, and to assess their potential roles in biotechnological applications.Abstract In this study, we evaluated the fungal diversity present associated with cores of Oligocene rocks using a DNA metabarcoding approach. We detected 940,969 DNA reads grouped into 198 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycota, Rozellomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Zoopagomycota, Aphelidiomycota (Fungi) and the fungal-like Oomycota (Stramenopila), in rank abundance order. Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Aspergillaceae sp. and Diaporthaceae sp. were assessed to be dominant taxa, with 22 fungal ASVs displaying intermediate abundance and 170 being minor components of the assigned fungal diversity. The data obtained displayed high diversity indices, while rarefaction indicated that the majority of the diversity was detected. However, the diversity indices varied between the cores analysed. The endolithic fungal community detected using a metabarcoding approach in the Oligocene rock samples examined contains a rich and complex mycobiome comprising taxa with different lifestyles, comparable with the diversity reported in recent studies of a range of Antarctic habitats. Due to the high fungal diversity detected, our results suggest the necessity of further research to develop strategies to isolate these fungi in culture for evolutionary, physiological, and biogeochemical studies, and to assess their potential role in biotechnological applications.},

  YEAR = {2025},
  ABSTRACT = {Primer selection and PCR methods can potentially lead to biased descriptions of microbial communities. Here, we investigated soil total fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community composition and diversity from diverse sites using several primers and amplification methods. The results showed that regardless of site, the ITS3tagmix1-5/ITS4ngs primer set generated a higher proportion of high-quality reads, targeted more fungal ASVs and revealed a higher total fungal alpha diversity compared to ITS3tagmix4/ITS4ngs. Among specific primers targeting the 18S rRNA gene, AMV4.5NF/AMDGR had differential specificity for Glomeraceae, whereas SSU515Fngs/Euk742R had differential specificity for Paraglomeraceae. Regardless of site, PCR approaches (nested vs non-nested) had higher influence on the AMF community structure than primer selection, though primer selection significantly influenced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi richness. Overall, the findings suggest that the specificity of amplification in relation to primer selection and PCR stringency should guide the best interpretation of fungal community diversity data from high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples.},

  ABSTRACT = {Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) represents one of the two vascular plants that have colonized the Antarctic continent, which is usually exposed to extreme environmental conditions. In this work, we have characterized the endophytic fungi associated with the leaves of D. antarctica. Endophytic fungi were recovered from 91 individual plants from different points of Admiralty Bay at King George Island, Antarctica. A total of 26 fungal isolates were obtained from 273 leaf fragments. All isolates were identified by analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the rDNA. Alternaria and Phaeosphaeria were the most frequent genera associated with the plant. Other fungal isolates were identified as Entrophospora sp. and several undescribed Ascomycete species. An interesting result was obtained for the isolates UFMGCB 215 and UFMGCB 262, which were related to fungi associated with bryophytes present in boreal ecosystems. Some isolates showed low identity in the ITS sequences to sequences of fungal species deposited in GenBank, suggesting that these fungi could be new species. This work is the first report on fungal endophytes associated with leaves of the Antarctic grass D. antarctica.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {44},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {Antarctica is a continent that presents extreme conditions for life. Numerous buildings that served as housing for expeditioners and scientists are considered historical heritage, including Casa Moneta Museum, located at the Orcadas Base on Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands (Antarctic Peninsula). It is built entirely of wood, and currently shows visible signs of deterioration. In this work, we studied the mycobiota present in the deteriorated wood of the museum to characterize the fungal diversity present. Macro-, micro-morphological and phylogenetic studies were carried out to identify the fungi isolated. Temperature tests were also performed to study the growth of different strains. Almost 20\% of the fungi isolated belonged to Cadophora. Other frequently obtained genera were Tulasnella (16\%), Cerinosterus (12\%), Coniochaeta (7\%), Geomyces (7\%), Acremonium (7\%) and Penicillium (7\%). Temperature tests indicated all strains isolated are psychrotolerant. Five species have been reported for the first time for Antarctica. Deterioration of historic wooden structures and artifacts in extreme environments is currently causing great concern, and in this study the identification of the fungi present in Casa Moneta's wood and the characterization of their metabolism could be a guide to the development of preservation strategies for this historical building.},

  TYPE = {Article; Proceedings Paper},
  VOLUME = {53},
  YEAR = {2005},
  ABSTRACT = {Lignin mineralization activity of three basidiomycetous litter-decomposing fungi (LDF) was studied with humus layer samples taken from a boreal forest soil. The total Pb concentration in the samples was 32,000 mg kg(-1) and water soluble Pb 67 mg kg(-1). Synthetic lignin mineralization by Collybia dryophila and Clitocybe (Lepista) nebularis was strongly inhibited, whereas Stropharia coronilla was more tolerant to Pb stress in soil and liquid Cultures. Purified laccases maintained their activity and purified MnPs remained partly active up to a concentration of 1450 mg Pb l(-1). High concentrations of Pb inhibited the growth of LDF and affected the activity of ligninolytic enzymes, but the extent of inhibition varied among different LDF species. In consequence, Pb contamination in soil may have a negative impact on recycling of organic carbon. (c) 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {60},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Rhizopogon (Boletales) is an ectomycorrhizal fungal genus that exhibits a strong specificity to Pinaceae. This strict association occurs almost exclusively with Pinus and Pseudotsuga, while associations with other genera in Pinaceae are inconclusive. Here, we describe Rhizopogon laricinus sp. nov. associated with Larix cajanderi distributed in northeastern Siberia, where forest fires are frequent. We confirmed the host identity by comparing rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences obtained from basidiomata and ectomycorrhizal root tips collected at the same sites. Morphological characteristics and molecular identification revealed that R. laricinus is a new species associated with Larix unequivocally. The molecular phylogeny based on ITS sequences placed this species sister to the subgenus Roseoli, which is specific to Pinus, and not to the Pseudotsuga-specific subgenus Villosuli. Thus, R. laricinus evolution does not correspond to host phylogeny as Larix and Pseudotsuga form a monophyletic Glade. Instead, ecological traits of Rhizopogon for adapting to disturbed habitats may have driven the host shift to Larix under high-frequency fire ecosystems. (C) 2019 The Mycological Society of Japan.

  TITLE = {Mycosporine-like amino acids and phylogenies in green algae:: Prasiola and its relatives from the Trebouxiophyceae (Chlorophyta)},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {41},
  YEAR = {2005},
  ABSTRACT = {A UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acid (324 nm-MAA), so far only known from the green macroalgal genus Prasiola (Trebouxiophyceae), was also identified in other morphologically diverse green algae closely related to Prasiola spp. in 18S rDNA phylogenies. Using HPLC, a second UV-absorbing compound was found only in Myrmecia incisa Reisigal among all studied strains. This substance showed an absorption maximum at 322 nm and hence was designated as putative 322 nm-MAA. Preliminary UV-exposure experiments indicated that all species containing one or the other MAA showed a strong accumulation of the respective compound, thus supporting their function as putative UV sunscreen. Both UV-absorbing substances were only identified in the studied members of the Trebouxiophyceae but were absent in members of the Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae. When mapped on an 18S rDNA phylogeny, the distribution of 324 nm-MAA was found to be scattered within the Trebouxiophyceae but was consistent with a distribution that follows phylogenetic patterns rather than ecological adaptations. The 324 nm-MAA was also detected in two phylogenetically related species from freshwater as well as from subaerial habitats, Watanabea reniformis Hanagata et al. and isolate UR7/5, which were phylogenetically independent of Prasiola and its closer allies. MAAs were absent in another Trebouxiophyceae clade comprising lichen photobionts (Coccomyxa pringsheimii Jaag) as well as freshwater picoplanktonic algae (Choricystis minor (Skuja) Fott). The data presented suggest a chemotaxonomic value of the 324 nm-MAA in green algal taxonomy. To address the paraphyly of the genus Myrmecia Printz as presently circumscribed, we propose the new combination Lobosphaera incisa.},

  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Antarctica includes different pristine environments dominated by extremophile microbial communities. Despite the ecological role importance of Antarctic microorganisms, some of them can represent interesting sources of bioproducts with potential industrial application. In the present study, we analysed the agarolytic and carrageenolytic activities of algicolous fungi from seven different macroalgal species of maritime Antarctica. After a selective isolation process, 44 fungal isolates were recovered and identified by biology molecular methods as belonging to the genera Antarctomyces, Beauveria, Cladosporium, Coprinellus, Doratomyces, Leucosporidiella, Metschnikowia, Penicillium, and Pseudogymnoascus. Rhodophyta macroalgae sheltered the fungi with the best potential for agarolytic and carrageenolytic activities. Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium sp., and Cladosporium sp. 2 simultaneously displayed the best carrageenolytic and agarolytic activities. Our results indicated that the Antarctic macroalgae shelter saprobe fungi that produce enzymes with the potential to degrade algal biomass and might release essential nutrients into the Antarctic Ocean. These agarolytic and/or carrageenolytic Antarctic fungi may also be useful in further industrial processes involving the biological extraction of agar and carrageenan, or their byproducts, to be used as substrates of third-generation bioethanol.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {37},
  YEAR = {2014},
  ABSTRACT = {Spore-forming bacteria are known to produce various enzymes and bioproducts valuable to different industries and to bear the harsh conditions found in the Antarctic environment. However, aerobic or facultative spore-forming bacterial communities found in maritime Antarctic soils yet remain poorly studied. In this study, 80 spore-forming and cold-adapted bacterial strains were isolated from nine different soil samples of King George Island, in maritime Antarctica, and further clustered into amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis groups within each soil. Representative strains were then identified as belonging to Bacillus, Rummeliibacillus, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The ability to produce extracellular enzymes, antimicrobial substances and biosurfactants was determined in all isolates. The enzymatic activities most frequently found among the isolates were as follows: esterase (45 \%), caseinase (30 \%), amylase (16.2 \%) and gelatinase (15 \%). Biosurfactant production was detected in 25 \% of the isolates. The growth inhibition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was observed in 13.7 \% of the strains tested, but only two strains inhibited the growth of Candida albicans. The isolated spore-forming bacterial species were also compared with the characteristics of the different Antarctic soils sampled based on their physicochemical properties, showing that pH, C and P were the main factors correlated with the distribution of this group of bacteria in the Antarctic soils studied. These Antarctic endospore-forming bacterial strains may have a potential for industrial processes occurring at low temperatures.},

  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {Recently, the study of the interactions within a microcosm between hosts and their associated microbial communities drew an unprecedented interest arising from the holobiont concept. Lichens, a symbiotic association between a fungus and an alga, are redefined as complex ecosystems considering the tremendous array of associated microorganisms that satisfy this concept. The present study focuses on the diversity of the microbiota associated with the seashore located lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum, recovered by different culture-dependent methods. Samples harvested from two sites allowed the isolation and the molecular identification of 68 fungal isolates distributed in 43 phylogenetic groups, 15 bacterial isolates distributed in five taxonomic groups and three microalgae belonging to two species. Moreover, for 12 fungal isolates belonging to 10 different taxa, the genus was not described in GenBank. These fungal species have never been sequenced or described and therefore non-studied. All these findings highlight the novel and high diversity of the microflora associated with R. geographicum. While many species disappear every day, this work suggests that coastal and wild environments still contain an unrevealed variety to offer and that lichens constitute a great reservoir of new microbial taxa which can be recovered by multiplying the culture-dependent techniques.},

  ABSTRACT = {This work describes the distribution and diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of Colobanthus quitensis, a dicotyledonous plant that lives in Antarctica. A total of 188 fungal isolates were obtained from six different sites located across a 25.5-km transect through Admiralty Bay, at King George Island. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene was sequenced and the endophytic fungi were identified as species belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Cadophora, Davidiella, Entrophospora, Fusarium, Geomyces, Gyoerffyella, Microdochium, Mycocentrospora, and Phaeosphaeria. Davidiella tassiana was the prevalent species with 20.2\% abundance. The endophytic fungal community showed low richness and high dominance indexes. Eleven endophytic taxa (58\%) were fungi able to produce melanin in their hyphae, which may confer resistance against freezing temperatures and high rates of UV radiation and may increase their fitness in the extreme conditions of the Antarctic environment. In addition, phytopathogenic and decomposer species associated with healthy leaves of C. quitensis were found. The results obtained in this work show that C. quitensis is an interesting reservoir of saprobic and pathogenic fungal species, and could be a community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies, as well as studies of the adaptation mechanisms these microorganisms have to the extreme conditions in Antarctica.},

The nematode species used in this study was Caenorhabditis elegans, feeding on Escherichia coli cultures. Determination of collagenase activity was made using insoluble collagen from bovine Achilles tendon and determining the amount of solubilized hydroxyproline produced. The results show that the total amount of collagenase produced by the Antarctic strain of A. tortor was about threefold higher than that observed for the other species. In the Antarctic strain, collagenase was shown to be a constitutive enzyme.},

  TITLE = {Some aspects of the great success of lichens in Antarctica},
  TYPE = {Article; Proceedings Paper},
  VOLUME = {12},
  YEAR = {2000},
  ABSTRACT = {The terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica is restricted to small, very isolated, ice-free areas on the continent and on the islands adjacent to the Peninsula region. Lichens, a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, form the most prominent component in the vegetation. They have the greatest number of species compared with other cryptogamic and unicellular organisms. They are able to colonize all types of solid substrata and have a low mineral nutrient demand. Their physiological vigour is derived from high freezing tolerance and the ability to be photosynthetically activated by water vapour uptake from snow at temperatures as low as c. -20 degrees C. Long-term monitoring in their natural habitats demonstrates that lichens are photosynthetically active at suboptimal temperatures. Locally, however, they can benefit from meltwater on insolated rocks, but only for short periods in early summer. Although at this time they may be exposed to substrate temperatures of > 20 degrees C and strong light they do not suffer from photostress. If, in winter, lichens are covered and kept dark by snow with temperatures close to 0 degrees C, lichens enter a negative carbon balance. This effect may be relevant to lichens under conditions of global or regional warming.},

  VOLUME = {33},
  YEAR = {2010},
  ABSTRACT = {Filamentous fungi and yeasts associated with the marine algae Adenocystis utricularis, Desmarestia anceps, and Palmaria decipiens from Antarctica were studied. A total of 75 fungal isolates, represented by 27 filamentous fungi and 48 yeasts, were isolated from the three algal species and identified by morphological, physiological, and sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region and D1/D2 variable domains of the large-subunit rRNA gene. The filamentous fungi and yeasts obtained were identified as belonging to the genera Geomyces, Antarctomyces, Oidiodendron, Penicillium, Phaeosphaeria, Aureobasidium, Cryptococcus, Leucosporidium, Metschnikowia, and Rhodotorula. The prevalent species were the filamentous fungus Geomyces pannorum and the yeast Metschnikowia australis. Two fungal species isolated in our study, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and M. australis, are endemic to Antarctica. This work is the first study of fungi associated with Antarctic marine macroalgae, and contributes to the taxonomy and ecology of the marine fungi living in polar environments. These fungal species may have an important role in the ecosystem and in organic matter recycling.},

  TITLE = {Internal transcribed spacer primers and sequences for improved characterization of basidiomycetous orchid mycorrhizas},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {177},
  YEAR = {2008},
  ABSTRACT = {Despite advances owing to molecular approaches, several hurdles still obstruct the identification of fungi forming orchid mycorrhizas. The Tulasnellaceae exhibit accelerated evolution of the nuclear ribosomal operon, causing most standard primers to fail in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) trials. Insufficient sequences are available from well characterized isolates and fruitbodies. Lastly, taxon-specific PCR primers are needed in order to explore the ecology of the fungi outside of the orchid root. Here, progress in overcoming these hurdles is reported. Broad-spectrum basidiomycete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers that do not exclude most known Tulasnellaceae are presented. BLAST searches and empirical PCR tests support their wide utility within the Basidiomycota. Taxon-specific ITS primers are presented targeted to orchid-associated Tulasnella, and a core component of the Thelephora-Tomentella complex. The efficiency and selectivity of these primer sets are again supported by BLAST searches and empirical tests. Lastly, ITS DNA sequences are presented from several strains of Epulorhiza, Ceratorhiza, Ceratobasidium, Sistotrema, Thanatephorus and Tulasnella that were originally described in the landmark mycorrhizal studies of Currah and Warcup. Detailed phylogenetic analyses reveal some inconsistencies in species concepts in these taxonomically challenging resupinate basidiomycetes, but also help to place several sequences from environmental samples.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {4},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Dispersal is a critical yet poorly understood factor underlying macroecological patterns in microbial communities(1). Airborne microbial transport is assumed to occupy a central role in determining dispersal outcomes(2,3), and extra-range dispersal has important implications for predicting ecosystem resilience and response to environmental changes. One of the most pertinent biomes in this regard is Antarctica, given its geographic isolation and vulnerability to climate change and human disturbances. Here, we report microbial diversity in near-ground and high-altitude air above the largest ice-free Antarctic habitat, as well as that of underlying soil microbial communities. We found that persistent local airborne inputs were unable to fully explain Antarctic soil community assembly. Comparison with airborne microbial diversity from high-altitude and non-polar sources suggests that strong selection occurs during long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of selection during airborne transit and at sink locations varied between microbial phyla. Overall, the communities from this isolated Antarctic ecosystem displayed limited connectivity to the non-polar microbial pool, and alternative sources of recruitment are necessary to fully explain extant soil diversity. Our findings provide critical insights into the role of airborne transport limitation in determining microbial biogeographic patterns.},

  TITLE = {A Phylogenetic and Functional Perspective on Volatile Organic Compound Production by Actinobacteria},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {4},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Soil microbes produce an immense diversity of metabolites, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can shape the structure and function of microbial communities. VOCs mediate a multitude of microbe-microbe interactions, including antagonism. Despite their importance, the diversity and functional relevance of most microbial volatiles remain uncharacterized. We assembled a taxonomically diverse collection of 48 Actinobacteria isolated from soil and airborne dust and surveyed the VOCs produced by these strains on two different medium types in vitro using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We detected 126 distinct VOCs and structurally identified approximately 20\% of these compounds, which were predominately C-1 to C-5 hetero-VOCs, including (oxygenated) alcohols, ketones, esters, and nitrogen-and sulfur-containing compounds. Each strain produced a unique VOC profile. While the most common VOCs were likely by-products of primary metabolism, most of the VOCs were strain specific. We observed a strong taxonomic and phylogenetic signal for VOC profiles, suggesting their role in finer-scale patterns of ecological diversity. Finally, we investigated the functional potential of these VOCs by assessing their effects on growth rates of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic pseudomonad strains. We identified sets of VOCs that correlated with growth inhibition and stimulation, information that may facilitate the development of microbial VOC-based pathogen control strategies. IMPORTANCE Soil microbes produce a diverse array of natural products, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Volatile compounds are important molecules in soil habitats, where they mediate interactions between bacteria, fungi, insects, plants, and animals. We measured the VOCs produced by a broad diversity of soil- and dust-dwelling Actinobacteria in vitro. We detected a total of 126 unique volatile compounds, and each strain produced a unique combination of VOCs. While some of the compounds were produced by many strains, most were strain specific. Importantly, VOC profiles were more similar between closely related strains, indicating that evolutionary and ecological processes generate predictable patterns of VOC production. Finally, we observed that actinobacterial VOCs had both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria that represent a plant-beneficial symbiont and a plant-pathogenic strain, information that may lead to the development of novel strategies for plant disease prevention.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {23},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {The Antarctic continent is characterized by extreme conditions and encompasses peculiar environments which represent promising habitats for the recovery of well-adapted microorganisms with unique metabolic capabilities. Enzymatic activity combined to salinity and pH tolerance of bacteria that thrive in low temperature environment have attracted attention of researchers in recent years and, as scarce information on that topic is available, the aim of this study was to prospect bacteria isolated from Antarctic samples for extracellular amylase activity and to determine their salinity and pH tolerances. Ninety-one bacteria isolated from Antarctic environmental samples, including marine sponges and invertebrates, sediments and soil biofilm, were screened. Fourty-two isolates were selected as putative amylase producers based on their ability to produce clearing zones in agar plates. Eighty-six and forty-four isolates were able to grow at 5 and 10\% NaCl concentrations, respectively. The best enzymatic activities for isolates 226 and 227 were 768.5 U dL 1 (20 degrees C) and 1410,16 U dL 1 (20 degrees C), respectively, both influenced by the temperature. All variables assayed showed statistically significant differences for isolates 227 and 226, demonstrating that enzyme activities respond differently to the applied conditions. This is the first report that describes the amylase activity from Carnobacterium and Psychrobacter strains isolated from Antarctic samples. These results encourage subsequent investigations of enzymes produced by microorganisms adapted to low temperatures and high osmolarity conditions, aiming future biotechnological application in pharmaceutical, textile or food industries.},

  ABSTRACT = {The Antarctic black meristematic fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 occurs endolithically in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, one of the best analogue for Mars environment on Earth. To date, this fungus is considered one of the best eukaryotic models for astrobiological studies and has been repeatedly selected for space experiments in the last decade. The obtained results are reviewed here, with special focus on responses to space relevant irradiation, UV radiation, and both sparsely and densely ionizing radiation, which represent the major injuries for a putative space-traveller. The remarkable resistance of this model organism to space stress, its radioresistance in particular, and mechanisms involved, significantly contributed to expanding our concept of limits for life and provided new insights on the origin and evolution of life in planetary systems, habitability, and biosignatures for life detection as well as on human protection during space missions.

  TYPE = {Article},

  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities are self-supporting borderline ecosystems spreading across the extreme conditions of the Antarctic desert and represent the predominant life-form in the ice-free areas of McMurdo Dry Valleys, accounted as the closest terrestrial Martian analogue. Components of these communities are highly adapted extremophiles and extreme-tolerant microorganisms, among the most resistant known to date. Recently, studies investigated biodiversity and community composition in these ecosystems but the metabolic activity of the metacommunity has never been investigated. Using an untargeted metabolomics, we explored stress-response of communities spreading in two sites of the same location, subjected to increasing environmental pressure due to opposite sun exposure, accounted as main factor influencing the diversity and composition of these ecosystems. Overall, 331 altered metabolites (206 and 125 unique for north and south, respectively), distinguished the two differently exposed communities. We also selected 10 metabolites and performed two-stage Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to test them as potential biomarkers. We further focused on melanin and allantoin as protective substances; their concentration was highly different in the community in the shadow or in the sun. These results clearly indicate that opposite insolation selected organisms in the communities with different adaptation strategies in terms of key metabolites produced.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {24},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Species with narrow niche breadths are assumed to be more susceptible to environmental changes than those with wide niche breadths. Although information on niche properties is necessary for predicting biological responses to environmental changes, such information is largely missing for soil microbes. In this study, we present the temperature niche positions and breadths of a functionally important group of eukaryotic soil microbes, ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. We compiled high-quality EM fungal sequence data from 26 forested sites in Japan (with mean annual temperatures ranging from 1.6 to 23.6 degrees C) to create temperature niche profiles for each individual fungal species. Nested theory and a newly developed weighted-randomization null model were applied to 75 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with high occurrence records to examine potential preferences for certain temperature positions and breadths. Our analyses revealed that (a) many EM fungal OTUs were restricted to habitats with low mean annual temperatures, (b) fungal OTUs observed at colder sites exhibited narrower temperature breadths than expected by chance, (c) the composition of EM fungal OTUs exhibited a nested pattern along the temperature gradient, and (d) EM fungal richness was highest at colder sites, where the greatest degree of overlap in OTU occurrence was observed. These findings imply that future warming may limit the distribution of many EM fungal species that are currently adapted to only cold climates. This could eventually reduce EM fungal biodiversity, which is linked to forest function through symbiotic associations with trees. This study demonstrates the distribution and environmental ranges of various EM fungal species and can contribute to develop species distribution models with the aim of conserving microbes in the face of climate change.},

  TITLE = {Cloning and expression of a Melanocarpus albomyces steryl esterase gene in Pichia pastoris and Trichoderma reesei},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {94},
  YEAR = {2006},
  ABSTRACT = {The ste1 gene encoding a steryl esterase was isolated from the thermophilic fungus Melanocarpus albomyces. The gene has one intron, and it encodes a protein consisting of 576 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the steryl esterase was shown to be related to lipases and other esterases such as carboxylesterases. Formation of mature protein requires post-translational removal of a putative 18-amino-acid signal sequence and a 13-residue propeptide at the N-terminus. The intronless version of the Melanocarpus albomyces ste1 gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris under the inducible AOX1 promoter. The production level was low, and a large proportion of the total activity yield was found to be present intracellularly. However, the fact that steryl esterase activity was produced by P. pastoris cells carrying the expression cassette confirmed that the correct gene had been cloned. The stet gene was subsequently expressed in T reesei under the inducible cbh1 promoter, and a clearly higher production level was obtained. About 60\% of the total activity was bound to the fungal mycelium or to solid components of the culture medium, or existed as aggregates. Triton X-100 was successfully used to recover this activity. The heterologous production system in T. reesei provides a means of producing M. albomyces steryl esterase STE1 reliably in large scale for future studies. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  ABSTRACT = {The search for traces of extinct or extant life in extraterrestrial environments is one of the main goals for astrobiologists; due to their ability to withstand stress producing conditions, extremophiles are perfect candidates for astrobiological studies. The BIOMEX project aims to test the ability of biomolecules and cell components to preserve their stability under space and Mars-like conditions, while at the same time investigating the survival capability of microorganisms. The experiment has been launched into space and is being exposed on the EXPOSE-R2 payload, outside of the International Space Station (ISS) over a time-span of 1.5 years. Along with a number of other extremophilic microorganisms, the Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 has been included in the experiment. Before launch, dried colonies grown on Lunar and Martian regolith analogues were exposed to vacuum, irradiation and temperature cycles in ground based experiments (EVT1 and EVT2). Cultural and molecular tests revealed that the fungus survived on rock analogues under space and simulated Martian conditions, showing only slight ultra-structural and molecular damage.},

  TITLE = {Basal ice formation in snow cover in Northern Finland between 1948 and 2016},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {13},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Basal ice formation in the terrestrial snow cover is a common phenomenon in northern circumpolar areas, onehaving significant impacts on ecosystems, vegetation, animals and human activities. There is limited knowledge on the spatial and temporal occurrence of basal ice formation because of the sparse observation network and challenges involved in detecting formation events. We present a unique dataset on the annual extent of ice formation events in northern Finland between 1948 and 2016 based on reindeer herders' descriptions of the cold season in their management reports. In extreme years, basal ice can form over wide geographical extents. In approximately half of the herding districts studied, it occurred more frequently in the period 1983-2016 than in the period 1948-1982. Furthermore, five out of seven of the most extensive basal ice formation events (90th percentile) occurred between 1991 and 2016. Themost commonly reported processes related to ice formation were thaw or rain-on-snow events followed by freezing of the snow cover. Years with extensive basal ice formation were often characterized by above-average October-December air temperatures, air temperature variations around 0 degrees C and relatively high precipitation. However, basal ice did not occur during all warm and wet early winters, and formation events were generally weakly linked to the large-scale atmospheric teleconnections. Another risk factor for reindeer grazing associated with warm and rainy earlywinters is the growth of mycotoxin-producing molds below the snow. Approximately 24\% of all reported mold formation events co-occurred with basal ice formation. The prevalence and frequency of basal ice formation events can be assessed based on our results. Ourwork contributes to understanding long-term fluctuations and changes in snow and ice conditions and the impacts of this variability in circumpolar areas.},

  ABSTRACT = {Twenty-seven strains of basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia spp. were collected from lake sediment and soil surrounding the lakes in the Skarvsnes area, East Antarctica. Based on sequence similarity of their ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions and D1/D2 domains, the isolated strains were classified into three species; Mrakia blollopis (18 strains), M. gelida (7 strains), and M. robertii (2 strains). All of the strains produced ethanol from glucose at 10 degrees C. Six strains selected from the 27 isolates were then tested for ethanol fermentation and ethanol tolerance at 100 g/l glucose. Mrakia blollopis SK-4 and M. blollopis NRI-4 completely consumed the glucose within 13 d and 6 d of fermentation respectively, and demonstrated high ethanol yields and ethanol tolerance. In contrast, M. blollopis AGK-3 and M. blollopis TKG1-2 exhibited low ethanol yields and poor ethanol tolerance. These results indicate that ethanol yields of different Mrakia species may depend on ethanol tolerance in individual strains. (C) 2015 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems are largely dominated by lichens, while shallow coastal environments are mainly covered by macroalgae. The aim of this study was to isolate and to evaluate the diversity of yeasts in different species of macroalgae and lichens collected in South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. A total of 405 yeasts were recovered (205 from macroalgae and 200 from lichens). The yeast community from macroalgae was most diversity than the yeast community from lichen. The dominance index was similar for both substrates. A total of 24 taxa from macroalgae and 18 from lichens were identified, and only 5 were common to both substrates. Metschnikowia australis, Mrakia sp., Rhodotorula glacialis and Glaciozyma litorale were the most abundant yeasts in macroalgae and Cryptococcus victoriae, Rhodotorula laryngis, Rhodotorula arctica, Trichosporon sp. 1 and Mrakia sp. were the most abundant in lichens. Based on molecular and phylogenetic analyses, four yeast from macroalgae and six from lichens were considered potential new species. This is the first study to report the yeast communities from the Antarctic macroalgae Himantothallus grandifolius and lichen Ramalina terebrata. Results suggest that Antarctic phyco and lichensphere represent a huge substrate for cold-adapted yeasts and enhanced the knowledge of the microbiota from extreme environments.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {117},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {In the multifaceted soil habitat, predation is one of the most successful strategies for obtaining food. An example of prokaryotic predators is myxobacteria. Although the prey spectra of some myxobacteria have been the subject of numerous studies, these myxobacteria are usually rare in soils compared to other myxobacterial families. Consequently, predation assays featuring easily cultivable myxobacteria provide only limited information on the myxobacterial potential and their interactions with organisms in the soil. Therefore, the prey spectrum of representatives of more common families was tested and compared with members of the model family Myxococcaceae. In a newly developed assay, the extent of lysis was tested against various Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, as well as four yeasts. It was shown that Kofleria flava and Haliangium ochraceum have an equally diverse prey spectrum as the model genera Myxococcus and Corallococcus. However, less well-studied myxobacteria often lyse the prey colonies to a larger extent. Yeasts were lysed just as efficiently as bacteria. Furthermore, it was tested whether different myxobacteria can inhibit the growth of filamentous fungi. Almost every strain was able to prevent the spread of at least one fungus. H. ochraceum showed the highest activity and inhibited all fungi, including plant pathogenic Fusarium. These multiple interactions together with the high relative abundance in situ, suggest that myxobacteria, especially understudied families, could have a more important role in the soil food web than previously thought. The individual interaction spectra of the different myxobacteria provide only a glimpse at the complex relationships between the organisms in soil, which still remain understudied.},

  VOLUME = {21},

  ABSTRACT = {We assessed the diversity of culturable fungi associated with rocks of continental Antarctica to evaluate their physiological opportunistic virulence potential in vitro. The seventy fungal isolates obtained were identified as nine species of Acremonium, Byssochlamys, Cladosporium, Debaryomyces, Penicillium, and Rhodotorula. Acremonium sp., D. hansenii, P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, P. tardochrysogenum, and R. mucilaginosa were able to grow at 37 degrees C; in addition, B. spectabilis displayed a high level of growth at 37 and 45 degrees C. Thirty-one isolates of P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, and P. tardochrysogenum were able to produce partial haemolysis on blood agar at 37 degrees C. Acremonium sp., P. citrinum, and P. tardochrysogenum showed spore sizes ranging from 2.81 to 5.13 mu m diameters at 37 degrees C. Of these, P. chrysogenum and P. tardochrysogenum displayed macro- and micro morphological polymorphism. Our results suggest that rocks of the ultra-extreme cold and dry environment of Antarctica harbour cryptic fungi phylogenetically close to opportunistic pathogenic and mycotoxigenic taxa with physiologic virulence characteristics in vitro.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {326},
  YEAR = {2025},
  ABSTRACT = {Isolation and extreme environmental conditions have significantly impacted terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity in Antarctica, with glacial cycles further limiting animal diversity to a small number of species. Among these, springtails are relatively abundant, though their taxonomic diversity remains low. Antarctic glaciers may serve as major dispersal barriers, leading to high levels of genetic divergence among isolated populations. In Victoria Land (continental Antarctica), the Tucker Glacier has been proposed as an example of such a barrier; however, different species or taxa may respond differently to the same geographical features. In this study, we tested whether geographic distance, major glacier tongues, and seawater channels influence the distribution of Kaylathalia klovstadi (Collembola; Isotomidae) in Northern Victoria Land. We conducted mitochondrial DNA haplotype analysis on fragments of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and ATP synthase 6 (atp6) in 62 individuals from six K. klovstadi populations. Our analysis provides new insights into the genetic diversity and distribution patterns of K. klovstadi by incorporating additional sampling sites, specimens, and molecular markers. We challenge previous views regarding the role of the Tucker Glacier as a significant physical barrier to springtail dispersal in Northern Victoria Land. Our findings suggest that the impact of physical barriers on the genetic diversity of Antarctic Collembola, including the species studied here, requires a more careful evaluation. L'isolamento e le condizioni ambientali estreme hanno avuto un impatto significativo sulla biodiversit \& agrave; degli invertebrati terrestri in Antartide, con i cicli glaciali che hanno ulteriormente limitato la diversit \& agrave; animale a un numero ridotto di specie. Tra queste, i collemboli sono relativamente abbondanti, sebbene la loro diversit \& agrave; tassonomica rimanga bassa. I ghiacciai antartici possono fungere da barriere significative per la dispersione delle specie, portando a livelli elevati di divergenza genetica tra popolazioni isolate.

In questo studio, abbiamo valutato se la distanza geografica, i principali ghiacciai e i canali d'acqua marina influenzano la distribuzione di Kaylathalia klovstadi (Collembola; Isotomidae) nella parte settentrionale della Terra di Vittoria. Abbiamo condotto un'analisi aplotipica del DNA mitocondriale su frammenti della subunit \& agrave; 1 della citocromo c ossidasi (cox1) e della ATP sintasi 6 (atp6) in 62 esemplari provenienti da sei popolazioni di K. klovstadi. La nostra analisi fornisce nuove informazioni sulla diversit \& agrave; genetica e sui modelli di distribuzione di K. klovstadi, incorporando siti di campionamento aggiuntivi, nuovi esemplari e marcatori molecolari. I risultati mettono in discussione il ruolo del Ghiacciaio Tucker come barriera fisica significativa per la dispersione di alcune specie di collemboli nella parte settentrionale della Terra di Vittoria. I nostri risultati suggeriscono che l'impatto delle barriere fisiche sulla diversit \& agrave; genetica dei collemboli antartici, inclusa la specie studiata in questo caso, debba essere valutato pi \& ugrave; accuratamente.},

  TITLE = {Cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) of Pseudomonas putida MCCC 1A00316 Isolated from Antarctic Soil: Identification and Characterization of Activity against Meloidogyne incognita},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {24},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Pseudomonas putida MCCC 1A00316 was originally isolated from an Antarctic soil and has demonstrated potential nematicidal activity. Thus, it has promising applications for the biological control of Meloidogyne incognita. The larval mortality and egg-hatching inhibition rates of M. incognita will increase with the rising concentration of culture filtrates of P. putida MCCC 1A00316 and the duration of exposure. Thus, this study aimed to separate, purify, and identify nematicidal compounds from P. putida MCCC 1A00316 and to validate their anti-M. incognita activities. Compounds were purified through silica gel column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Structural identification was conducted through liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, C-13-NMR, and Marfey's method. The isolated compounds were identified as cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) on the basis of the results of the above analyses and previously reported data. The effects of various concentrations of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) on the mortality rates of second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. incognita were investigated. Results showed that HPLC-purified cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) displayed nematicidal activities. The mortality rate of M. incognita J2 reached 84.3\% after 72 h of exposure to 67.5 mg/L cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu). The lowest egg-hatching rate (9.74\%) was observed after 8 days of incubation with 2000 mg/L cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu). An egg-hatching rate of 53.11\% was obtained under the control treatment (sterile distilled water). However, cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) did not elicit chemotaxis activity to M. incognita. This is the first work to investigate the anti-M. incognita characteristics of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu).},

  ABSTRACT = {Two species of coniferous silicified wood are described from the El Freno Formation (Lower Jurassic) at Cerro La Brea, on the southern margin of the Atuel River, southern Mendoza Province, Argentina. Agathoxylon liguaensis Torres and Philippe (Araucariaceae) and the new species Podocarpoxylon atuelensis sp. nov. (Podocarpaceae) were described based on a detailed description of the secondary xylem. Wood specimens are well preserved, although some sections display variably decaying cell-walls typical of white-rotting by extant fungi. Vegetative and sexual structures in the degraded areas are identifiable as basidiomycetes. This is consistent with fungal saprotrophism and supports the role of fungi in the recycling of the organic matter in Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems. Considering the available geochronologic and biostratigraphic data and the current lithostratigraphic settings proposed for the unit, the age of the El Freno Formation at the studied locality can be constrained to the Hettangian-Sinemurian.},

  TITLE = {Ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species participate in enzymatic oxidation of humus in northern forest ecosystems},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {203},
  YEAR = {2014},
  ABSTRACT = {In northern forests, belowground sequestration of nitrogen (N) in complex organic pools restricts nutrient availability to plants. Oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi may aid plant N acquisition by providing access to N in macromolecular complexes. We test the hypotheses that ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species produce Mn-dependent peroxidases, and that the activity of these enzymes declines at elevated concentrations of inorganic N. In a boreal pine forest and a sub-arctic birch forest, Cortinarius DNA was assessed by 454-sequencing of ITS amplicons and related to Mn-peroxidase activity in humus samples with- and without previous N amendment. Transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes was investigated in field samples. Phylogenetic analyses of Cortinarius peroxidase amplicons and genome sequences were performed. We found a significant co-localization of high peroxidase activity and DNA from Cortinarius species. Peroxidase activity was reduced by high ammonium concentrations. Amplification of mRNA sequences indicated transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes under field conditions. The Cortinarius glaucopus genome encodes 11 peroxidases - a number comparable to many white-rot wood decomposers. These results support the hypothesis that some ectomycorrhizal fungi - Cortinarius species in particular - may play an important role in decomposition of complex organic matter, linked to their mobilization of organically bound N.},

  TITLE = {Diversity, Distribution, and Ecology of Fungi in the Seasonal Snow of Antarctica},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {7},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {We characterized the fungal community found in the winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula. From the samples of snow, 234 fungal isolates were obtained and could be assigned to 51 taxa of 26 genera. Eleven yeast species displayed the highest densities; among them, Phenoliferia glacialis showed a broad distribution and was detected at all sites that were sampled. Fungi known to be opportunistic in humans were subjected to antifungal minimal inhibition concentration. Debaryomyces hansenii, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium sp. 3, and Penicillium sp. 4 displayed resistance against the antifungals benomyl and fluconazole. Among them, R. mucilaginosa isolates were able to grow at 37 degrees C. Our results show that the winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula contains a diverse fungal community dominated by cosmopolitan ubiquitous fungal species previously found in tropical, temperate, and polar ecosystems. The high densities of these cosmopolitan fungi suggest that they could be present in the air that arrives at the Antarctic Peninsula by air masses from outside Antarctica. Additionally, we detected environmental fungal isolates that were resistant to agricultural and clinical antifungals and able to grow at 37 degrees C. Further studies will be needed to characterize the virulence potential of these fungi in humans and animals.},

  ABSTRACT = {Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated with high frequency from samples of ornithogenic soil collected from an Adelie penguin rookery at Hallet Station, Antarctica. While A. fumigatus has been well documented as the principal incitant of aspergillosis among penguins in captivity, this represents the 1st report of its presence in antarctic materials. A. flavus and A. ustus were also found in the Hallett samples. In a comparable number of soil and guano samples from isolated Adelie rookeries on Foyn Island and Possession Island, these fungi were not encountered. Their presence at Hallett Station may be the result of human contamination. A brief consideration of epidemiological implications is given.},

  VOLUME = {127},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {. We expanded our knowledge of the Cladonia cariosa group by seeking out and sequencing squamulose epodetiate Cladonia specimens in western North America. Cladonia galindezii, a species in the Cladonia cariosa group with large squamules forming thick mats and often containing porphyrilic acid, as in the type specimen from Antarctica, was found in several western states, new to the United States. In the same clade were specimens with atranorin only or atranorin with norstictic acid. We also establish Cladonia andereggii as another species in the C. cariosa group, from Idaho and Washington, based on sequencing new specimens from near the type locality. Although C. andereggii resembles C. symphycarpa in having norstictic acid-containing medium-sized squamules, ITS sequences of C. andereggii showed that it is more closely related to C. cariosa than to C. symphycarpa. We also demonstrated chemical diversity in the remainder of the C. cariosa group in western North America, with five chemotypes, all with atranorin, most frequently with atranorin only, less frequently with porphyrilic acid, homosekikaic acid, norstictic acid, or fumarprotocetraric acid, some of these in combination with rangiformic acid. While C. andereggii consistently contained norstictic acid and atranorin, C. galindezii and the remainder of C. cariosa s.l. varied in major substances.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {6},
  YEAR = {2014},
  ABSTRACT = {Lipases have applications for the industrial processing of lipids, including concentrating and/or modifying fish oil derived omega-3 fatty acids, widely used as nutritional supplement and functional food ingredients. A range of para-nitrophenol (pNP) acyl esters were synthesised as a means to rapidly screen lipases for fatty acid selectivity using spectrophotometric detection. The chosen esters were based primarily on the most abundant fatty acids present in anchovy and tuna oils. pNP derivatives of C16:1 n-7, C18:1 n-9 (OA), C18:2 n-6 (LA), C18:3 n-3 (ALA), C20:5 n-3 (EPA) and C22:6 n-3 (DMA) were synthesised. Storage stability of these pNP derivatives was shown to be at least 6 months and all pNP derivatives, including those of EPA and DHA, were shown to be stable throughout the conditions of the assay. We applied the new assay substrates for the determination of fatty acid selectivity of five widely utilised lipases. Results showed that the lipase from Candida rugosa was the most selective in terms of omega-3 specificity, preferentially hydrolysing all other medium long-chain substrates. Lipases from Rhizomucor miehei and Thermomyces lanuginosa also showed selectivity, with a significant preference for saturated fatty acids. Candida antarctica lipase B and Aspergillus niger lipase were the least selective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {40},

  ABSTRACT = {The Antarctic cryptoendolithic fungi of the ice-free desert could have evolved genetically and geographically isolated since the separation of the Continent from the Gondwanaland. The resulting harsh environmental conditions due to the migration of Antarctica to the South Pole led to a strong selective pressure possibly promoting adaptive radiation and speciation. Microorganisms evolved during this unique process are adapted to colonize what is known as the closest Martian environment on Earth. For this reason they have been already suggested as the best eukaryotic model for exobiological speculations. The results on freeze and thawing, UV exposure and osmotic stress tolerance here reported highlight an uncommon ability of surviving under these external pressures. Studies on their ability to withstand space conditions are in progress in view of the opportunity of direct space exposure on the International Space Station. The results could give new tools to solve the conflict concerning the Panspermia hypothesis. (c) 2007 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {14},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {Dust has been widely recognised as an important source of nutrients in the marine environment and as a vector for transporting pathogenic microorganisms. Disturbingly, in the wake of a dust storm event along the eastern Australian coast line in 2009, the Continuous Plankton Recorder collected masses of fungal spores and mycelia (\~{}150,000 spores/m(3)) forming a floating raft that covered a coastal area equivalent to 25 times the surface of England. Cultured A. sydowii strains exhibited varying metabolite profiles, but all produced sydonic acid, a chemotaxonomic marker for A. sydowii. The Australian marine fungal strains share major metabolites and display comparable metabolic diversity to Australian terrestrial strains and to strains pathogenic to Caribbean coral. Secondary colonisation of the rafts by other fungi, including strains of Cladosporium, Penicillium and other Aspergillus species with distinct secondary metabolite profiles, was also encountered. Our bioassays revealed that the dust-derived marine fungal extracts and known A. sydowii metabolites such as sydowic acid, sydowinol and sydowinin A adversely affect photophysiological performance (F-v/F-m) of the coral reef dinoflagellate endosymbiont Symbiodinium. Different Symbiodinium clades exhibited varying sensitivities, mimicking sensitivity to coral bleaching phenomena. The detection of such large amounts of A. sydowii following this dust storm event has potential implications for the health of coral environments such as the Great Barrier Reef.},

  TYPE = {Article; Proceedings Paper},
  VOLUME = {12},
  YEAR = {2000},
  ABSTRACT = {Increasing interest in the ecological roles, conservation and biotechnological potential of Antarctic microbiota has focused attention on their biodiversity and evolutionary origins. Antarctic microbial ecosystems provide useful models for general questions in evolutionary ecology given the relative isolation of the South Polar Region, the severe biological constraints imposed by the polar environment, and the absence of higher plants and animals in some Antarctic habitats. Sealed environments such as Lake Vostok and the overlying East Antarctic ice sheet provide unique, natural culture collections for studying microorganisms that have been isolated from the global gene pool over timescales of evolutionary significance. Most Antarctic environments, however, continue to receive microbial propagules from outside the region, as indicated by spore trap data, the microflora found in Antarctic snow and ice, the colonising taxa at geothermal sites, and the high frequency of apparently cosmopolitan species in most habitats. Differences in environmental stability and selection pressure among environments are likely to influence the degree of adaptive radiation and microbial endemism. The latter seems greater in the Southern Ocean by comparison with non-marine ecosystems of Antarctica, although there is some evidence of endemic species in highly specialised niches on the continent such. as in the endolithic habitat and saline lakes. Analytical techniques such as 16S rDNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridisation are beginning to provide new insights into the genetic affinities and biodiversity of Antarctic microbiota, and are leading to a more rigorous evaluation of microbial endemism.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {48},
  YEAR = {2025},
  ABSTRACT = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) is frequently used to infer distributions of microorganisms in Antarctica. Their distributions relative to environmental variables are, in turn, sometimes used to infer their physiological range (and a relationship between the two is generally assumed for conservation purposes). We sought to determine whether ecological inferences based on distributions accurately reflect tolerances of the organisms concerned, using 249 legacy non-marine samples from a latitudinal gradient between 72 and 86 degrees S, Antarctica. A cyanobacterium, a heterotrophic bacterium, two eukaryotic algae, two fungi, and a moss were isolated into culture, and their field distributions inferred using eDNA analysis of the samples above. Tolerances of each organism with respect to environmental predictors were then inferred from the eDNA distribution and metadata using Generalised Additive Models. We then measured growth of the cultured isolates in response to a set of these predictors. Laboratory responses were then compared to inferences from the eDNA/metadata. Predictions from eDNA/metadata agreed with the results of physiological laboratory experiments for strains that were detected at high taxonomic resolution in the field samples. However, errors were never completely eliminated, and direct contradictions occurred when strains were represented at lower taxonomic resolution in the field data. We found that accurate ecological inference from eDNA studies would be best achieved via maximising both taxonomic resolution (through marker choice/read length) and ecological signal (through careful sampling design and rigorous metadata collection).},

  TITLE = {Ecological niche drives fungal and bacterial diversity in endolithic and epilithic communities inhabiting granites in Victoria Land, Antarctica},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {48},
  YEAR = {2025},
  ABSTRACT = {The Antarctic continent harbors unique ecosystems, including diverse microbial communities inhabiting rocky substrates. Despite extensive research on Antarctic microbial ecology, a gap in knowledge persists regarding the comparative analysis of microbial communities associated with Antarctic granite rocks and the microenvironment created by the thalli of the epilithic lichens growing on them. The present study addresses this gap. Using high-throughput sequencing approaches we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of fungal and bacterial communities colonizing endolithic and epilithic niches on granites in Antarctica. Our results revealed distinct differences between endolithic and epilithic communities in terms of diversity and composition. Lecanoromycetes was the most frequent fungal class in both groups, which accounts for 78.5\% in the endolithic and 53.5\% in the epilithic samples, respectively. The prevalence of lichenized fungi in both habitats suggests their pivotal role in shaping the diversity and composition of the Antarctic microbial communities. Endolithic communities exhibited higher bacterial diversity, most probably influenced by a combination of environmental factors and the complex interplay between lichens and other microorganisms. Stress-resistant bacterial taxa, as the radioresistant Truepera and Rubrobacter species were specifically found in the endolithically colonized specimens, suggesting that the endolithic lifestyle promotes a more specific ability to adapt throughout environmental extremes. Moreover, the endolithic niche in granites seems to positively select cyanobacteria, as they were found to play a significant role in endolithic communities, demonstrating their adaptability to low-light conditions and their importance in nutrient cycling. Overall, our findings shed light on the ecological dynamics of microbial communities in extreme environments and highlight the importance of further research to elucidate their roles in Antarctic ecosystems.},

  TITLE = {The relative importance of the bacterial pathway and soil inorganic nitrogen increase across an extreme wood-ash application gradient},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {10},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Ash from combustion of biofuels, for example wood chips, is often deposited as waste, but due to its high content of essential plant nutrients and alkalinity, it has been proposed to recycle ash as a fertilizer and liming agent in biofuel production forest. However, current legislation sets rather strict limitations for wood-ash application in biofuel production systems. The soil microfood web, that is microorganisms and their microfaunal grazers, protozoa and nematodes, is pivotal for essential ecosystem processes such as decomposition and plant nutrient release. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the impacts on microfood web structure and functioning must precede actions towards raising the currently allowed application rates. In a Danish Norway spruce plantation, we evaluate the impact of wood ash applied at dosages from 0 to the extreme case of 90 t ash ha(-1) on the microfood web, the bacterial community structure, soil content of inorganic nitrogen, organic matter, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we disentangled the direct effect of the disturbance imposed by ash per se, the associated pH increase and changes in prey abundance on individual organism groups in the microfood web. The SEM showed that the pH rise was the main driver of increasing abundances of culturable heterotrophic bacteria with increasing ash doses, and via trophical transfer, this also manifested as higher abundances of bacterial grazers. Fungal-feeding nematodes were unaffected by ash, whereas carnivorous/omnivorous nematodes decreased due to the direct effect of ash. Increasing ash doses enhanced the difference between bacterial communities of control plots and ash-amended plots. The ash-induced stimulation of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and bacterial grazers increased inorganic nitrogen availability at ash doses of 9 t ha(-1) and above. Hence, raised limits for ash application may potentially benefit tree growth via enhanced N mineralization activity of the soil food web.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {41},
  YEAR = {2009},
  ABSTRACT = {The evaluation of fungal root endophytes of two multizonal mountain plant species (Soldanella carpatica and Homogyne alpine) in relation to altitude was conducted. The comparison of root colonization by coarse arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM F) and the fine AMF endophyte (Glomus tenue), as well as the presence of dark septate endophytes (DSE) were assessed along altitudinal gradients (1000-2050 m a.s.l.) oil calcareous and non-calcareous substrata in the Tatra Mts. (Western Carpathians). Additionally, AMF species composition in the rhizosphere of the investigated plants was determined. Coarse AMIF dominated over the fine endophyte in roots of S. carpatica and H. alpina, In the case of S. carpatica, there was a tendency for coarse AMF colonization decline with increasing altitude, while the reverse trend wits observed for the fine endophyte. In contrast, the altitudinal patterns of the two types were opposite in H. alpina. Fifteen AMF species associated with the rhizosphere of'S. carpatica were identified at the sites located in the Western Tatra Mountains, whereas spores of only our species were isolated from the rhizosphere of H. alpina in the High Tatra Mountains. None of the identified AMF species was observed to occur both in the High and Western Tatra Mts. DSE accompanied AMF in the roots of S. carpatica and H. alpina at each site: however, the root colonization by this group Of fungi was low. The DSE colonization did not have a consistent relationship with altitude in both plant species. The results suggest that at the investigated altitudes factors such as the type Of Substrata, host plants, and local plant species composition may play a more important role in determining root colonization as well as the establishment of a local AMF Community than the climatic changes with increasing elevation above sea level.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {24},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {We evaluated the diversity and distribution of viable fungi present in permafrost and active layers obtained from three islands of Maritime Antarctica. A total of 213 fungal isolates were recovered from the permafrost, and 351 from the active layer, which were identified in 58 taxa; 27 from permafrost and 31 from the active layer. Oidiodendron, Penicillium, and Pseudogymnoascus taxa were the most abundant in permafrost. Bionectriaceae, Helotiales, Mortierellaceae, and Pseudeurotium were the most abundant in the active layer. Only five shared both substrates. The yeast Mrakia blollopis represented is the first reported on Antarctic permafrost. The fungal diversity detected was moderate to high, and composed of cosmopolitan, cold-adapted, and endemic taxa, reported as saprobic, mutualistic, and parasitic species. Our results demonstrate that permafrost shelters viable fungi across the Maritime Antarctica, and that they are contrasting to the overlying active layer. We detected important fungal taxa represented by potential new species, particularly, those genetically close to Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which can cause extinction of bats in North America and Eurasia. The detection of viable fungi trapped in permafrost deserves further studies on the extension of its fungal diversity and its capability to expand from permafrost to other habitats in Antarctica, and elsewhere.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {53},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {Jurassic hot-spring chert deposits in the Deseado Massif, Patagonia, Argentina, have been known for over two decades, but the associated biota has only begun to be documented recently, and thus far only from a small number of localities. Here we report the discovery of a large complex of well-exposed Upper Jurassic epithermal siliceous deposits represented by organic-rich cherts preserved within the geothermal system from La Bajada, Santa Cruz, Argentina. The chert samples analyzed so far contain exceptionally well-preserved, in situ and transported, tri-dimensionally silicified plants, animals and microorganisms. Plants include equisetaleans (Equisetum thermale), ferns and gymnosperms. Among them, well-preserved in situ osmundaceous rhizomes in different developmental stages are the dominant component of the taphoflora. Conifers are represented by wood, seeds, leaves and pollen tentatively assigned to the families Araucariaceae and Cheirolepidiaceae. The assemblage also contains vegetative and reproductive structures of fungi, oomycetes, cyanobacteria, algae, testate amoebas, ciliates and numerous remains of unresolved taxonomic affinity. Microorganisms are preserved isolated in the chert matrix or directly associated with plants and other organic remains in mutualistic, parasitic and saprotrophic engagements. Also present are numerous coprolites and arthropod remains that, along with the named microorganisms, are indicative of trophic relationships in the ecosystem. Altogether, this fossil assemblage suggests that distal paleoenvironments within the geothermal system are preserved at La Bajada. The diversity, abundance, and exceptional preservation of fossils in the La Bajada ecosystem provides a unique window into the geological past that offers a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of middle Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {Acremonium is acknowledged as a highly ubiquitous genus including saprobic, parasitic, or endophytic fungi that inhabit a variety of environments. Species of this genus are extensively exploited in industrial, commercial, pharmaceutical, and biocontrol applications, and proved to be a rich source of novel and bioactive secondary metabolites. Acremonium has been recognised as a taxonomically difficult group of ascomycetes, due to the reduced and high plasticity of morphological characters, wide ecological distribution and substrate range. Recent advances in molecular phylogenies, revealed that Acremonium is highly polyphyletic and members of Acremonium s. lat. belong to at least three distinct orders of Sordariomycetes, of which numerous orders, families and genera with acremonium-like morphs remain undefined. To infer the phylogenetic relationships and establish a natural classification for acremonium-like taxa, systematic analyses were conducted based on a large number of cultures with a global distribution and varied substrates. A total of 633 cultures with acremonium-like morphology, including 261 ex-type cultures from 89 countries and a variety of substrates including soil, plants, fungi, humans, insects, air, and water were examined. An overview phylogenetic tree based on three loci (ITS, LSU, rpb2) was generated to delimit the orders and families. Separate trees based on a combined analysis of four loci (ITS, LSU, rpb2, tef-1a) were used to delimit species at generic and family levels. Combined with the morphological features, host associations and ecological analyses, acremonium-like species evaluated in the present study are currently assigned to 63 genera, and 14 families in Cephalothecales, Glomerellales and Hypocreales, mainly in the families Bionectriaceae, Plectosphaerelaceae and Sarocladiaceae and five new hypocrealean families, namely Chrysonectriaceae, Neoacremoniaceae, Nothoacremoniaceae, Pseudoniessliaceae and Valsonectriaceae. Among them, 17 new genera and 63 new combinations are proposed, with descriptions of 65 new species. Furthermore, one epitype and one neotype are designated to stabilise the taxonomy and use of older names. Results of this study demonstrated that most species of Acremonium s. lat. grouped in genera of Bionectriaceae, including the type A. alternatum. A phylogenetic backbone tree is provided for Bionectriaceae, in which 183 species are recognised and 39 well-supported genera are resolved, including 10 new genera. Additionally, rpb2 and tef-1a are proposed as potential DNA barcodes for the identification of taxa in Bionectriaceae.},

  ABSTRACT = {Describing the total biodiversity of an environmental metacommunity is challenging due to the presence of cryptic and rare species and incompletely described taxonomy. How many samples to collect is a common issue that faces ecologists when designing fieldwork sampling. Nowadays, high-throughput sequencing allows examination of large numbers of samples enabling comprehensive biodiversity assessments. In this study, we sought to estimate how the scale of sampling affects accuracy of community diversity description in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Southern Victoria Land) in Antarctica accounted as the closest Martian analogue on Earth, exhibiting extreme conditions such as low temperatures, wide thermal fluctuations, low nutrient availability and high UV radiation. We found that sampling effort, based on accumulation curves and statistical analysis, had a considerable impact on assessing species richness and composition in these ecosystems, confirming that a sampling as large as nine rock specimens was necessary to detect almost all fungal species present, but was not sufficient to capture whole bacterial assemblage. The sampling would require approximately four times more effort (40 samples) for a comprehensive description of bacterial diversity. Our findings will be helpful to develop strategies to exhaustively describe the microbial diversity of Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {90},
  YEAR = {2009},
  ABSTRACT = {Amino acids play an important role in ecology as essential nutrients for animals and as currencies in symbiotic associations. Here we present a new approach to tracing the origins of amino acids by identifying unique patterns of carbon isotope signatures generated by amino acid synthesis in plants, fungi, and bacteria ({''}C-13 fingerprints''). We measured amino acid delta C-13 from 10 C-3 plants, 13 fungi, and 10 bacteria collected and isolated from a boreal forest in interior Alaska, USA, using gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). Microorganisms were cultured under amino-acid-free conditions and identified based on DNA sequences. Bacteria, fungi, and plants generated consistent, unique C-13 fingerprints based on the more complex amino acids (five or more biosynthetic steps) that are classified as essential for animals. Linear discriminant analysis classified all samples correctly with >99\% certainty and correctly classified nearly all insect samples from a previous study by diet. Our results suggest that delta C-13 fingerprints of amino acids could provide a powerful in situ assay of the biosynthetic sources of amino acids and a potential new tool for understanding nutritional linkages in food webs.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {169},
  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {Biomass productivity of black spruce trees is strongly limited by soil nitrogen (N) in shallow active layer on permafrost. Trees and mycorrhizal roots are known to absorb amino acids to bypass slow N mineralization in Nlimited boreal forest soils. However, amino acid uptake strategy of tree roots cannot fully explain their advantages in competition for soil N with other plants and microbes. We investigated the potentials of tree roots to absorb urea as well as amino acids and inorganic N, using tracer experiments of 13C, 15N-labelled glutamic acid and urea and 15N-labelled ammonium nitrate in black spruce forests growing on permafrost-affected soils with different permafrost table depths in the eastern edge of the Mackenzie river delta (northwest Canada). We demonstrated that black spruce roots have potentials to absorb intact urea but only in soils with shallow permafrost, where urea accumulates due to limited microbial mineralization activity. This contrasts with soils with deep permafrost table, where roots absorb amino acids and inorganic N. Allocation of fine roots to colder subsoil above permafrost provides advantages for trees monopolizing urea-N. Despite lower energy efficiency of urea utilization compared to inorganic N and amino acids, urea uptake is one of N acquisition strategies for spruce growing on N-limited subarctic soil.},

  VOLUME = {7},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Saxicolous rock ripe lichens that grow on rocks in the East Antarctic fellfields were sampled for phylotypic characterization of its constituent mycobionts (fungi) and photobionts (algae and cyanobacteria). The rock tripe lichen-forming fungal and algal phylotypes were classified under the common lichen-forming genera of ascomycetes, namely, Umbilicaria, and green algae, namely, Trebouxia and Coccomyxa. However, phylotypes of the green algal chloroplasts and the lichen-associated cyanobacteria showed unexpectedly high diversity. The detected chloroplast phylotypes were not fully affiliated with the green algal genera Trebouxia or Coccomyxa. The predominant chloroplast phylotype demonstrated maximum resemblance to Neglectella solitaria, which is neither a known Antarctic species nor a typical lichen photobiont. Another dominant chloroplast phylotype belonged to the atypical Antarctic green algae family. Cyanobacterial phylotypes were dominated by those affiliated with the Microcoleus species rather than the well-known lichen-associates, Nostoc species. The occurrences of these Microcoleus-affiliated cyanobacterial phylotypes were specifically abundant within the Yukidori Valley site, one of the Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA). The ASPA site, along with another 50 km-distant site, yielded most of the cryptic diversity in the phylotypes of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, which may contribute to the phenotypic variability within the rock tripe lichen photobionts.},

  ABSTRACT = {A total of 564 isolates of endophytic fungi were recovered from the plants Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis collected from Antarctica. The isolates were screened against parasites Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi and against the human tumour cell lines. Of the 313 fungal isolates obtained from D. antarctica and 251 from C. quitensis, 25 displayed biological activity. Nineteen extracts displayed leishmanicidal activity, and six inhibited the growth of at least one tumour cell line. These fungi belong to 19 taxa of the genera Alternaria, Antarctomyces, Cadophora, Davidiella, Helgardia, Herpotrichia, Microdochium, Oculimacula, Phaeosphaeria and one unidentified fungus. Extracts of 12 fungal isolates inhibited the proliferation of L. amazonesis at a low IC50 of between 0.2 and 12.5 mu g ml(-1). The fungus Phaeosphaeria herpotrichoides displayed only leishmanicidal activity with an IC50 of 0.2 mu g ml(-1), which is equivalent to the inhibitory value of amphotericin B. The extract of Microdochium phragmitis displayed specific cytotoxic activity against the UACC-62 cell line with an IC50 value of 12.5 mu g ml(-1). Our results indicate that the unique angiosperms living in Antarctica shelter an interesting bioactive fungal community that is able to produce antiprotozoal and antitumoral molecules. These molecules may be used to develop new leishmanicidal and anticancer drugs.},

Fungi were characterized by fluorescence microscopy Culturing and sequence analyses of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers. A total of 270 fungal colonies were cultured from the accretion ice of subglacial Lake Vostok and an additional 14 from the glacial ice immediately above the accretion ice. Mean concentrations were 0-4.42 cells mL(-1) ice meltwater of which 0-100\% exhibited viability (as determined by fluorescence microscopy). Thirty-one unique fungal ribosomal DNA sequences (28 from accretion ice and three from glacial ice) were determined and compared to recent taxa. The results, plus tests for growth at low temperatures, indicated that Lake Vostok contains a mixture of heterotrophic psychrotolerant fungal species. This indicates that the lake is not sterile but contains a unique ecosystem.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {145},
  YEAR = {2011},
  ABSTRACT = {Soil fungal diversity plays a fundamental role in delivering key ecosystem goods and services. This article assesses diversity of saprobic soil and litter microfungi, as taxonomical and functional components which affect above- and below-ground relationships within Alpine and Mediterranean regions of Italy. We highlighted biodiversity high spots focusing on four research topics that have been developed over time and are currently in progress in Italy. Preliminary quantitative data concerning soil microfungi in the Raethian Alps showed a strong reduction of Colony Forming Unit (CFU)s with altitude. Keratinophilic microfungi in natural and anthropogenic environments were widespread among filamentous fungi and 121 species have been isolated in Italy since 1960. Heat stimulated microfungi in Mediterranean region soils showed high values both in abundance and species density even two years after the experimental fire, with Neosartorya spp. playing a pivotal role. The diversity of microfungi of Quercus ilex (150 species), in the Mediterranean region, higher than that in leaf litter of other species, was explained mainly by different forms of growth and the phytoclimatic characters of the areas under study.},

  TITLE = {Abundance and Diversity of n-Alkane-Degrading Bacteria in a Forest Soil Co-Contaminated with Hydrocarbons and Metals: A Molecular Study on alkB Homologous Genes},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {62},
  YEAR = {2011},
  ABSTRACT = {Unraveling functional genes related to biodegradation of organic compounds has profoundly improved our understanding of biological remediation processes, yet the ecology of such genes is only poorly understood. We used a culture-independent approach to assess the abundance and diversity of bacteria catalyzing the degradation of n-alkanes with a chain length between C(5) and C(16) at a forest site co-contaminated with mineral oil hydrocarbons and metals for nearly 60 years. The alkB gene coding for a rubredoxin-dependent alkane monooxygenase enzyme involved in the initial activation step of aerobic aliphatic hydrocarbon metabolism was used as biomarker. Within the area of study, four different zones were evaluated: one highly contaminated, two intermediately contaminated, and a noncontaminated zone. Contaminant concentrations, hydrocarbon profiles, and soil microbial respiration and biomass were studied. Abundance of n-alkane-degrading bacteria was quantified via real-time PCR of alkB, whereas genetic diversity was examined using molecular fingerprints (T-RFLP) and clone libraries. Along the contamination plume, hydrocarbon profiles and increased respiration rates suggested on-going natural attenuation at the site. Gene copy numbers of alkB were similar in contaminated and control areas. However, T-RFLP-based fingerprints suggested lower diversity and evenness of the n-alkane-degrading bacterial community in the highly contaminated zone compared to the other areas; both diversity and evenness were negatively correlated with metal and hydrocarbon concentrations. Phylogenetic analysis of alkB denoted a shift of the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community from Gram-positive bacteria in the control zone (most similar to Mycobacterium and Nocardia types) to Gram-negative genotypes in the contaminated zones (Acinetobacter and alkB sequences with little similarity to those of known bacteria). Our results underscore a qualitative rather than a quantitative response of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria to the contamination at the molecular level.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {12},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {For the first time, a mycological analysis of outdoor urban environment (air, leaves, sealed surfaces) was carried in the cities of subarctic (Murmansk) and temperate (Moscow) climatic zones. The chemical composition of dust deposited on leaves of dominant tree species was taken as an indicator of the air quality. Assessment of the complex impact of factors (climate zone, type of substrate, anthropogenic load) on the quantitative and qualitative parameters of mycobiome was performed. Compared to Moscow, Murmansk was characterized by an increased number and concentrations of pollutants in the deposited dust. The number of culturable airborne fungi in Murmansk was substantially lower than in Moscow. Half of the species belonged to the opportunistic in both cities. Most dangerous opportunistic fungi were absent in the air of recreational zones but present on leaves surface and in road dust in all assessed zones of the cities. Dust chemical composition affected the diversity of fungi species. While the relationship of biological parameters with concentration of potentially toxic metals was generally negative, Cd increased the fraction of opportunistic fungi in road dust. The study revealed an importance of substrate in determining the sensitivity of outdoor mycobiome to pollution and highlighted its biological characteristics sensitive to climate.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {10},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {One of the primary current astrobiological goals is to understand the limits of microbial resistance to extraterrestrial conditions. Much attention is paid to ionizing radiation, since it can prevent the preservation and spread of life outside the Earth. The aim of this research was to study the impact of accelerated He ions (150 MeV/n, up to 1 kGy) as a component of the galactic cosmic rays on the black fungusC. antarcticuswhen mixed with Antarctic sandstones-the substratum of its natural habitat-and two Martian regolith simulants, which mimics two different evolutionary stages of Mars. The high dose of 1 kGy was used to assess the effect of dose accumulation in dormant cells within minerals, under long-term irradiation estimated on a geological time scale. The data obtained suggests that viable Earth-like microorganisms can be preserved in the dormant state in the near-surface scenario for approximately 322.000 and 110.000 Earth years within Martian regolith that mimic early and present Mars environmental conditions, respectively. In addition, the results of the study indicate the possibility of maintaining traces within regolith, as demonstrated by the identification of melanin pigments through UltraViolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometric approach.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {31},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Antarctica is one of the most suitable locations for the bioprospecting of psychrotrophic fungi, which play a key role in the nutrient cycle and organic material mineralization in cold environments. These actions mainly take place via the production of several cold-active extracellular enzymes. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of filamentous fungi from King George Island (25 De Mayo Island), Antarctica and their ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes at low temperatures. A total of 51 fungal isolates were obtained from 31 samples. Twelve genera were identified, with seven among the Ascomycota (Cadophora, Helotiales, Monographella, Oidodendron, Penicillium, Phialocephala, Phialophora, Phoma and Pseudogymnoascus), one Basidiomycota (Irpex) and two Mucoromycota (Mortierella and Mucor). Monographella lycopodina and Mucor zonatus, not previously reported in Antarctica, were identified. Nine isolates could not be identified to genus level and may represent novel species. Most of the studied fungi were psychrotrophic (76.5\%). Nevertheless, only five isolates were able to grow at 35 degrees C, 15 degrees C being the optimal growth temperature for 65\% of the fungal isolates. Results from enzyme production at low temperature revealed that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse fungi, which represent potential tools for biotechnological applications in cold regions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Seedlings of the annual grass Vulpia ciliata ssp. ambigua were grown in sterilized sand with a dark septate root fungus, Phialophora graminicola, which had been isolated from a natural population of the grass. Tiller number and shoot, root and total biomass of seedlings grown with P. graminicola were enhanced relative to uninoculated control plants in a growth room and a glasshouse experiment. Root length of seedlings grown with P. graminicola was significantly increased, but no effects of the fungus on root diameter, number of root hairs or specific root length were recorded. Root nitrogen content and shoot, root and total phosphorus contents of seedlings grown with the fungus were enhanced, but shoot nitrogen concentration of these plants was reduced. Shoot biomass and specific root length of inoculated plants were positively associated with the number of P. graminicola colonies reisolated from roots. These data indicate that P. graminicola acts as a beneficial associate of V. ciliata ssp. ambigua seedlings under controlled conditions.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {242},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {Research on mycorrhizal symbiosis has been slowed by a lack of established study systems. To address this challenge, we have been developing Suillus, a widespread ecologically and economically relevant fungal genus primarily associated with the plant family Pinaceae, into a model system for studying ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations. Over the last decade, we have compiled extensive genomic resources, culture libraries, a phenotype database, and protocols for manipulating Suillus fungi with and without their tree partners. Our efforts have already resulted in a large number of publicly available genomes, transcriptomes, and respective annotations, as well as advances in our understanding of mycorrhizal partner specificity and host communication, fungal and plant nutrition, environmental adaptation, soil nutrient cycling, interspecific competition, and biological invasions. Here, we highlight the most significant recent findings enabled by Suillus, present a suite of protocols for working with the genus, and discuss how Suillus is emerging as an important model to elucidate the ecology and evolution of ECM interactions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Endolithic growth within rocks is a critical adaptation of microbes living in harsh environments where exposure to extreme temperature, radiation, and desiccation limits the predominant life forms, such as in the ice-free regions of Continental Antarctica. The microbial diversity of the endolithic communities in these areas has been sparsely examined. In this work, diversity and composition of bacterial assemblages in the cryptoendolithic lichen-dominated communities of Victoria Land (Continental Antarctica) were explored using a high-throughput metabarcoding approach, targeting the V4 region of 16S rDNA. Rocks were collected in 12 different localities (from 14 different sites), along a gradient ranging from 1000 to 3300 m a.s.l. and at a sea distance ranging from 29 to 96 km. The results indicate Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are the dominant taxa in all samples and defined a `core' group of bacterial taxa across all sites. The structure of bacteria communities is correlated with the fungal counterpart and among the environmental parameters considered, altitude was found to influence bacterial biodiversity, while distance from sea had no evident influence.},

  ABSTRACT = {A survey was undertaken to determine the extent of Leratiomyces ceres (syn. Stropharia aurantiaca sensu auct.) in soil surrounding apparently isolated occurrences of fungal fruit bodies on woodchip mulch. A molecular detection system with specific primers identified the fungus in the soil below woodchip in which fruit bodies had been noted in the previous year, and also in adjacent soil beyond the mulched area where fruiting had not been observed. The results indicate that L. ceres is widespread in the soil in the survey area, and possible reasons for this finding, and their implication for distribution studies are discussed.

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {31},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {Wildfires can negatively affect ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities. However, potential shifts in community structures due to wildfires have rarely been evaluated in the forests of eastern Eurasia, where surface fires are frequent. We investigated EM fungal communities in a Larix gmelinii-dominated forest that burned in 2003 in Zeya, in the Russian Far East. A total of 120 soil samples were collected from burned and adjacent unburned forest sites. The EM fungal root tips were morphotyped and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were obtained for fungal identification. We detected 147 EM fungal operational taxonomic units, and EM fungal richness was 25\% lower at the burned site than at the unburned site. EM fungal composition was characterized by the occurrence of disturbance-adapted fungi (Amphinema and Wilcoxina) at the burned site and late-successional fungi (Lactarius, Russula and Cortinarius) at the unburned site. These findings suggest that the EM fungal communities did not recover to pre-fire levels 16 years after the fire. Suillus species were the dominant EM fungi on L. gmelinii, with greater richness and frequency at the burned site. Both Larix and Suillus exhibit adaptive traits to quickly colonize fire-disturbed habitats. Frequent surface fires common to eastern Eurasia are likely to play important roles in maintaining Larix forests, concomitantly with their closely associated EM fungi.},

  TITLE = {Coccomyxa cimbrica sp. nov., a green microalga found in association with carnivorous plants of the genus Drosera L.},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {54},
  YEAR = {2019},
  ABSTRACT = {Coccomyxa Schmidle (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) is a genus of green microalgae that has worldwide distribution, with representatives found in a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Members of this taxon can be free-living and/or associated with other organisms, establishing different types of relationships (e.g. parasitic, symbiotic). The most frequent organisms forming associations with Coccomyxa are fungi and marine animals, most importantly mussels. Moreover, there is a well-documented association between a Coccomyxa strain and Gingko biloba and some Coccomyxa-like microalgae have been found in the bark of other trees. Here we describe a green algal strain found in association with carnivorous plants of the genus Drosera L. The systematics of Coccomyxa based only on classical methods is problematic, due to the very simple morphology of the genus and its high phenotypic plasticity. Therefore, the microalga associated with Drosera plants was isolated, maintained in culture and subjected to an integrative taxonomy approach, including morphological, ultrastructural and molecular analyses, along with ecological considerations. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the rbcL and 18S rRNA genes and molecular data obtained from the ITS2 spacer, including both sequence and secondary structure analyses, showed that the investigated microorganism belonged to a lineage distinct from those sequenced so far. An accurate taxonomic comparison between the microalga associated with Drosera and each of the species already described for the genus Coccomyxa was also carried out, considering morphology, ultrastructure and ecology. The results as a whole allowed us to erect a new species inside the genus Coccomyxa: Coccomyxa cimbrica K.Sciuto, B.Baldan \& I.Moro},

  TITLE = {Diversity and extracellular enzymatic activities of yeasts isolated from King George Island, the sub-Antarctic region},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {12},
  YEAR = {2012},
  ABSTRACT = {Background: Antarctica has been successfully colonized by microorganisms despite presenting adverse conditions for life such as low temperatures, high solar radiation, low nutrient availability and dryness. Although these ``cold-loving{''} microorganisms are recognized as primarily responsible for nutrient and organic matter recycling/mineralization, the yeasts, in particular, remain poorly characterized and understood. The aim of this work was to study the yeast microbiota in soil and water samples collected on King George Island. Results: A high number of yeast isolates was obtained from 34 soil and 14 water samples. Molecular analyses based on rDNA sequences revealed 22 yeast species belonging to 12 genera, with Mrakia and Cryptococcus genera containing the highest species diversity. The species Sporidiobolus salmonicolor was by far the most ubiquitous, being identified in 24 isolates from 13 different samples. Most of the yeasts were psychrotolerant and ranged widely in their ability to assimilate carbon sources (consuming from 1 to 27 of the 29 carbon sources tested). All species displayed at least 1 of the 8 extracellular enzyme activities tested. Lipase, amylase and esterase activity dominated, while chitinase and xylanase were less common. Two yeasts identified as Leuconeurospora sp. and Dioszegia fristingensis displayed 6 enzyme activities. Conclusions: A high diversity of yeasts was isolated in this work including undescribed species and species not previously isolated from the Antarctic region, including Wickerhamomyces anomalus, which has not been isolated from cold regions in general. The diversity of extracellular enzyme activities, and hence the variety of compounds that the yeasts may degrade or transform, suggests an important nutrient recycling role of microorganisms in this region. These yeasts are of potential use in industrial applications requiring high enzyme activities at low temperatures.},

  TITLE = {Symbiotic fungal associations in `lower' land plants},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {355},
  YEAR = {2000},
  ABSTRACT = {An analysis of the current state of knowledge of symbiotic fungal associations in `lower' plants is provided Three fungal phyla, the Zygomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, are involved in forming these associations, each producing a distinctive suite of structural features in well-defined groups of `lower' plants. Among the `lower' plants only mosses and Equisetum appear to lack one or other of these types of association. The salient features of the symbioses produced by each fungal group are described and the relationships between these associations and those formed by the same or related fungi in `higher' plants are discussed. Particular consideration is given to the question of the extent to which root-fungus associations in `lower' plants are analogous to `mycorrhizas' of `higher' plants and the need for analysis of the functional attributes of these symbioses is stressed. Zygomycetous fungi colonize a wide range of extant lower land plants (hornworts, many hepatics, lycopods, Ophioglossales, Psilotales and Gleicheniaceae), where they often produce structures analogous to those seen in the vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizas of higher plants, which are formed by members of the order Glomales. A preponderance of associations of this kind is in accordance with palaeobotanical and molecular evidence indicating that glomalean fungi produced the archetypal symbioses with the first plants to emerge on to land. It is shown, probably for the first time, that glomalean fungi forming typical VA mycorrhiza with a higher plant (Plantago lanceolata) can colonize a thalloid liverwort (Pellia epiphylla), producing arbuscules and vesicles in the hepatic. The extent to which these associations, which are structurally analogous to mycorrhizas, have similar functions remains to be evaluated. Ascomycetous associations are found in a relatively small number of families of leafy liverworts. The structural features of the fungal colonization of rhizoids and underground axes of these plants are similar to those seen in mycorrhizal associations of ericaceous plants like Vaccinium. Cross inoculation experiments have confirmed that a typical mycorrhizal endophyte of ericaceous plants, Hymenoscyphus ericae, will form associations in liverworts which are structurally identical to those seen in nature. Again, the functional significance of these associations remains to be examined. Some members of the Jungermanniales and Metzgeriales form associations with basidiomycetous fungi. These produce intracellular coils of hyphae, which are similar to the pelotons seen in orchid mycorrhizas, which also involve basidiomycetes. The fungal associates of the autotrophic Aneura and of its heterotrophic relative Cryptothallus mirabilis have been isolated. In the latter case it has been shown that the fungal symbiont is an ectomycorrhizal associate of Betula, suggesting that the apparently obligate nature of the association between the hepatic and Betula in nature is based upon requirement for this particular heterotroph.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mt. Erebus, Antarctica, is the southernmost active volcano in the world and harbors diverse geothermally unique ecosystems, including ``Subglacial{''} and ``Exposed{''} features, surrounded by a vast desert of ice and snow. Previous studies, while limited in scope, have highlighted the unique and potentially endemic biota of Mt. Erebus. Here, we provide an amplicon-based biodiversity study across all domains of life and all types of geothermal features, with physicochemical and biological data from 48 samples (39 Exposed and 9 Subglacial) collected through various field seasons. We found potentially high taxonomic novelty among prokaryotes and fungi, supporting past hypotheses of high endemism due to the distinctive and isolated environment; in particular, the large number of taxonomically divergent fungal sequences was surprising. We found that different site types had unique physicochemistry and biota; Exposed sites were warmer than Subglacial (median: 40 degrees C versus 10 degrees C for Exposed and Subglacial, respectively) and tended to have more photosynthetic organisms ( Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta). Subglacial sites had more Actinobacteriota, correlated with greater concentrations of Ca and Mg present. Our results also suggest potential human impacts on these remote, highly significant sites, finding evidence for fungal taxa normally associated with wood decay. In this study, we provide a blueprint for future work aimed at better understanding the novel biota of Mt. Erebus.},

  TITLE = {DNA Metabarcoding Reveals Cryptic Diversity in Forest Soils on the Isolated Brazilian Trindade Island, South Atlantic},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {85},
  YEAR = {2023},
  ABSTRACT = {Located 1140 km from the South American coastline in the South Atlantic Ocean and with an age of 4 million years, Trindade Island is the most recent volcanic component of Brazilian territory. Its original native vegetation has been severely damaged by human influence, in particular through the introduction of exotic grazing animals such as goats. However, since the complete eradication of goats and other feral animals in the late 1990s, the island's vegetation has been recovering, and even some endemic species that had been considered extinct have been rediscovered. In this study, we set out to characterize the contemporary cryptic diversity in soils of the recovering native forest of Trindade Island using metabarcoding by high throughput sequencing (HTS). The sequence diversity obtained was dominated by microorganisms, including three domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) and five kingdoms (Fungi, Metazoa, Protozoa, Chromista, and Viridiplantae). Bacteria were represented by 20 phyla and 116 taxa, with Archaea by only one taxon. Fungi were represented by seven phyla and 250 taxa, Viridiplantae by five phyla and six taxa, Protozoa by five phyla and six taxa, Metazoa by three phyla and four taxa and Chromista by two phyla and two taxa. Even after the considerable anthropogenic impacts and devastation of the island's natural forest, our sequence data reveal the presence of a rich and complex diversity of microorganisms, invertebrates, and plants and provide important baseline biodiversity information that will contribute to ecological restoration efforts on the island.},

  TITLE = {The 2024 Outline of Fungi and fungus-like taxa},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {15},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {With the simultaneous growth in interest from the mycological community to discover fungal species and classify them, there is also an important need to assemble all taxonomic information onto common platforms. Fungal classification is facing a rapidly evolving landscape and organizing genera into an appropriate taxonomic hierarchy is central to better structure a unified classification scheme and avoid incorrect taxonomic inferences. With this in mind, the Outlines of Fungi and fungus-like taxa (2020, 2022) were published as an open-source taxonomic scheme to assist mycologists to better understand the taxonomic position of species within the Fungal Kingdom as well as to improve the accuracy and consistency of our taxonomic language. In this paper, the third contribution to the series of Outline of Fungi and fungus-like taxa prepared by the Global Consortium for the Classification of Fungi and fungus-like taxa is published. The former is updated considering our previous reviews and the taxonomic changes based on recent taxonomic work. In addition, it is more comprehensive and derives more input and consensus from a larger number of mycologists worldwide. Apart from listing the position of a particular genus in a taxonomic level, nearly 1000 notes are provided for newly established genera and higher taxa introduced since 2022. The notes section emphasizes on recent findings with corresponding references, discusses background information to support the current taxonomic status and some controversial taxonomic issues are also highlighted. To elicit maximum taxonomic information, notes/taxa are linked to recognized databases such as Index Fungorum, Faces of Fungi, MycoBank and GenBank, Species Fungorum and others. A new feature includes links to Fungalpedia, offering notes in the Compendium of Fungi and fungus-like Organisms. When specific notes are not provided, links are available to webpages and relevant publications for genera or higher taxa to ease data accessibility. Following the recent synonymization of Caulochytriomycota under Chytridiomycota, with Caulochytriomycetes now classified as a class within the latter, based on formally described and currently accepted data, the Fungi comprises 19 Phyla, 83 classes, 1,220 families, 10,685 genera and ca 140,000 species. Of the genera, 39.5\% are monotypic and this begs the question whether mycologists split genera unnecessarily or are we going to find other species in these genera as more parts of the world are surveyed? They are 433 speciose genera with more than 50 species. The document also highlights discussion of some important topics including number of genera categorized as incertae sedis status in higher level fungal classification. The number of species at the higher taxonomic level has always been a contentious issue especially when mycologists consider either a lumping or a splitting approach and herein we provide figures. Herein a summary of updates in the outline of Basidiomycota is provided with discussion on whether there are too many genera of Boletales, Ceratobasidiaceae, and speciose genera such as Colletotrichum. Specific case studies deal with Cortinarius, early diverging fungi, Glomeromycota, a diverse early divergent lineage of symbiotic fungi, Eurotiomycetes, marine fungi, Myxomycetes, Phyllosticta, Hymenochaetaceae and Polyporaceae and the longstanding practice of misapplying intercontinental conspecificity. The outline will aid to better stabilize fungal taxonomy and serves as a necessary tool for mycologists and other scientists interested in the classification of the Fungi.},

  ABSTRACT = {This article provides an outline of the classification of the kingdom Fungi (including fossil fungi. i.e. dispersed spores, mycelia, sporophores, mycorrhizas). We treat 19 phyla of fungi. These are Aphelidiomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiobolomycota, Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Calcarisporiellomycota, Caulochytriomycota, Chytridiomycota, Entomophthoromycota, Entorrhizomycota, Glomeromycota, Kickxellomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Mortierellomycota, Mucoromycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Olpidiomycota, Rozellomycota and Zoopagomycota. The placement of all fungal genera is provided at the class-, order- and family-level. The described number of species per genus is also given. Notes are provided of taxa for which recent changes or disagreements have been presented. Fungus-like taxa that were traditionally treated as fungi are also incorporated in this outline (i.e. Eumycetozoa, Dictyosteliomycetes, Ceratiomyxomycetes and Myxomycetes). Four new taxa are introduced: Amblyosporida ord. nov. Neopereziida ord. nov. and Ovavesiculida ord. nov. in Rozellomycota, and Protosporangiaceae fam. nov. in Dictyosteliomycetes. Two different classifications (in outline section and in discussion) are provided for Glomeromycota and Leotiomycetes based on recent studies. The phylogenetic reconstruction of a four-gene dataset (18S and 28S rRNA, RPB1, RPB2) of 433 taxa is presented, including all currently described orders of fungi.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two new species of ascomycetes, Apiosordaria antarctica, isolated from soil, and Thielavia antarctica, isolated from a sample of the lichen Usnea cf. aurantio-atra, both collected on King George Island (Antarctica), are described and illustrated. Apiosordaria antarctica is characterized by ostiolate ascomata with agglutinated hairs, eight-spored, uniseriate and cylindrical asci, and two-celled, irregularly navicular ascospores, with an upper cell ornamented with very small warts and with an apical germ pore. Thielavia antarctica is characterized by nonostiolate ascomata, with a thick peridium, eight-spored, cylindrical asci, uniseriate, oblate, ovoid ascospores, a slightly protruding apical germ pore, and a phialidic anamorph.},

  ABSTRACT = {Glomus kerguelense sp. nov. was isolated from a gravelly mineral soil at Kerguelen Islands, in association with the rhizosphere. of introduced Agrostis stolonifera, Poaceae. This golden yellow spored species is distinguished from other Glomeraceae species by the granular ornamentation of the interior surface of the inner spore wall layer, and by a spongy zone gradually developed within the middle spore wall layer. The isolate differentiated vesicles and arbuscles inside Allium porrum roots and sporulated profusely in pot cultures. Glomus kerguelense is, with G. antarcticum, the second Glomales species described originally from the Antarctic region.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {10},
  YEAR = {1990},
  ABSTRACT = {The linear growth rates of fungal isolates were measured on agar plates at temperatures ranging from 4.degree. to 35.degree. C. Fungi tested included the major fungal colonizers of leaves and litter of the three dominant plant species on subantarctic Macquarie Island, and major fungal species associated with plant and soil communities near Australia''s Casey Station on the Antarctic Continent. All fungi grew at 4.degree. C and were classified as psychrotrophs. Maximum growth rates were recorded at temperatures of 10.degree. to 20.degree. C for 13 of the 15 isolates from Macquarie Island and for all six isolates from Casey. Most of the leaf colonizing fungi from Macquarie Island had optimum growth temperatures of 15.degree. C whereas all litter fungi from Macquarie Island and Casey fungi except Thelebolus microsporus had optimum growth temperatures of 20.degree. C or above. Maximum growth of all species was at temperatures above those normally prevailing in their natural enviroments, with most species growing at 4.degree. C at between 10\% and 30\% of their maximum rates. However, microclimatic effects have resulted at times in temperatures near their growth optima. The highest growth rates at 4.degree. C were recorded for Phoma spp. 1 and 2, Phoma exigua and Mortierella gamsii from Macquarie Island and Mortierella sp. 1 from Casey. Thelebolus microsporus and sterile sp. G from Casey also grew relatively fast at 4.degree.C, and these species, and Phoma sp. 3 and Phoma exigua from Macquarie Island had the lowest Q-10 values for the temperature range 4.degree. to 15.degree. C.},

  ABSTRACT = {A comparative study of the bacteria occurring in soils of montane grasslands, montane forests, subalpine forests and alpine tundra habitats was conducted to ascertain the types of bacterial metabolic or enzymatic activities in the soils of these ecosystems. Elevation substantially affected taxa isolated. Amylolytic, cellulolytic and pectinolytic activity was observed in cultured isolates from all areas. Proteolytic activity was not observed in isolates from alpine tundra but was observed in cultures isoalted from all other areas. Microbial population sizes remained constant with increased elevation but organismic diversity decreased. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria were isolated from all ecosystems studied. Free-living N-fixing organisms were isolated in large numbers from all areas except the alpine tundra. Rapid degradation of cellulose seems to be the result of a cooperative effect between bacteria and fungi in alpine tundra soils.},

  ABSTRACT = {Knowledge of the relationships and thus the classification of fungi, has developed rapidly with increasingly widespread use of molecular techniques, over the past 10-15 years, and continues to accelerate. Several genera have been found to be polyphyletic, and their generic concepts have subsequently been emended. New names have thus been introduced for species which are phylogenetically distinct from the type species of particular genera. The ending of the separate naming of morphs of the same species in 2011, has also caused changes in fungal generic names. In order to facilitate access to all important changes, it was desirable to compile these in a single document. The present article provides a list of generic names of Ascomycota (approximately 6500 accepted names published to the end of 2016), including those which are lichen-forming. Notes and summaries of the changes since the last edition of `Ainsworth \& Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi' in 2008 are provided. The notes include the number of accepted species, classification, type species (with location of the type material), culture availability, life-styles, distribution, and selected publications that have appeared since 2008. This work is intended to provide the foundation for updating the ascomycete component of the ``Without prejudice list of generic names of Fungi'' published in 2013, which will be developed into a list of protected generic names. This will be subjected to the XIXth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen in July 2017 agreeing to a modification in the rules relating to protected lists, and scrutiny by procedures determined by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (NCF). The previously invalidly published generic names Barriopsis, Collophora (as Collophorina), Cryomyces, Dematiopleospora, Heterospora (as Heterosporicola), Lithophila, Palmomyces (as Palmaria) and Saxomyces are validated, as are two previously invalid family names, Bartaliniaceae and Wiesneriomycetaceae. Four species of Lalaria, which were invalidly published are transferred to Taphrina and validated as new combinations. Catenomycopsis Tibell \& Constant. is reduced under Chaenothecopsis Vain., while Dichomera Cooke is reduced under Botryosphaeria Ces. \& De Not. (Art. 59).},

  ABSTRACT = {As belonging to one of the most isolated continents on our planet, the microbial composition of different environments in Antarctica could hold a plethora of undiscovered species with the potential for biotechnological applications. This manuscript delineates our discoveries after an expedition to the Bulgarian Antarctic Base ``St. Kliment Ohridski{''} situated on Livingston Island, Antarctica. Amplicon-based metagenomics targeting the 16S rRNA genes and ITS2 region were employed to assess the metagenomes of the bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities across diverse sites within and proximal to the research station. The predominant bacterial assemblages identified included Oxyphotobacteria, Bacteroidia, Gammaprotobacteria, and Alphaprotobacteria. A substantial proportion of cyanobacteria reads were attributed to a singular uncultured taxon within the family Leptolyngbyaceae. The bacterial profile of a lagoon near the base exhibited indications of penguin activity, characterized by a higher abundance of Clostridia, similar to lithotelm samples from Hannah Pt. Although most fungal reads in the samples could not be identified at the species level, noteworthy genera, namely Betamyces and Tetracladium, were identified. Archaeal abundance was negligible, with prevalent groups including Woesearchaeales, Nitrosarchaeum, Candidatus Nitrosopumilus, and Marine Group II.},

(Caryophyllaceae) and Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Gramineae). The new species here proposed are: Acrodontium antarcticum nov. sp., Chalara antarctica nov. sp. and Phialophora dancoii nov. sp. These new species were found during the ``Campana Antartica Argentina de verano 1989{''} in Danco Coast, Base Primavera (64.degree. 10''S, 60.degree. 57''W). The same locality is indicated in a map by Gamundi and Spinedi (1987). The fungal isolation was carried out using the soil washing technique (Parkinson and Williams, 1961).},

  VOLUME = {14},
  YEAR = {2010},
  ABSTRACT = {Worldwide glaciers are annually retreating due to global overheating and this phenomenon determines the potential lost of microbial diversity represented by psychrophilic microbial population sharing these peculiar habitats. In this context, yeast strains, all unable to grow above 20A degrees C, consisting of 42 strains from Antarctic soil and 14 strains isolated from Alpine Glacier, were isolated and grouped together based on similar morphological and physiological characteristics. Sequences of the D1/D2 and ITS regions of the ribosomal DNA confirmed the previous analyses and demonstrated that the strains belong to unknown species. Three new species are proposed: Mrakia robertii sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8912), Mrakia blollopis sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8921) and a related anamorphic species Mrakiella niccombsii sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8917). Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region revealed that the new proposed species were closely related to each other within the Mrakia clade in the order Cystofilobasidiales, class Tremellomycetes. The Mrakia clade now contains 8 sub-clades. Teliospores were observed in all strains except CBS 8918 and for the Mrakiella niccombsii strains.},

  TITLE = {A rhamnolipid biosurfactant increased bacterial population size but hindered hydrocarbon biodegradation in weathered contaminated soils},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {778},
  YEAR = {2021},
  ABSTRACT = {Surfactants are used to enhance the bioavailability of recalcitrant residual petroleum contamination during bioremediation. However, surfactants in some cases inhibit biodegradation, which is often attributed to their toxicity. Herein, we showthat a rhamnolipid biosurfactant likely served as a carbon source and exhibited physiological inhibition on petroleum biodegradation. The addition of biosurfactants in mixed, batch, slurry bioreactors with soils from a petroleum-contaminated site led to a dose-dependent shift in the microbial community with a decrease in diversity and increase in population size and delayed biodegradation. Microbial community analysis indicated the enrichment of Alphaproteobacteria affiliated taxa such as Sphingomonadaceae in systems amended with biosurfactant. The diversitywas significantly lower in systemswith higher doses of biosurfactants compared to systems without biosurfactant. Droplet Digital PCR indicated a 30-90 fold increase in 16S rRNA copy numbers in systemswith higher doses of biosurfactant than control systemswithout surfactant and nutrients, whereas the nutrient amendment alone led to a two-fold increase in population size. Total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis showed that the biodegradation extent was negatively impacted by rhamnolipid at the highest dose compared to lower doses (23\% vs. 40\%) or without the biosurfactant. Indigenous isolates cultivated from the oil-amended soil exhibited growth on rhamnolipid as a sole carbon source. A novel insight gained is how dose-dependent responses of microbial communities to biosurfactants alter the biodegradation time profile of hydrocarbons. The study highlights the significance ofmicrobial assessment prior to surfactant-mediated bioremediation practices. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  TITLE = {Wood Ash Induced pH Changes Strongly Affect Soil Bacterial Numbers and Community Composition},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {8},
  YEAR = {2017},
  ABSTRACT = {Recirculation of wood ash from energy production to forest soil improves the sustainability of this energy production form as recycled wood ash contains nutrients that otherwise would be lost at harvest. In addition, wood-ash is beneficial to many soils due to its inherent acid-neutralizing capabilities. However, wood ash has several ecosystem-perturbing effects like increased soil pH and pore water electrical conductivity both known to strongly impact soil bacterial numbers and community composition. Studies investigating soil bacterial community responses to wood ash application remain sparse and the available results are ambiguous and remain at a general taxonomic level. Here we investigate the response of bacterial communities in a spruce forest soil to wood ash addition corresponding to 0, 5, 22, and 167 t wood ash ha(-1). We used culture-based enumerations of general bacteria, Pseudomonas and sporeforming bacteria combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to valuate soil bacterial responses to wood ash application. Results showed that wood ash addition strongly increased soil pH and electrical conductivity. Soil pH increased from acidic through neutral at 22 t ha(-1) to alkaline at 167 t ha(-1). Bacterial numbers significantly increased up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha(-1) followed by significant decrease at 167 t ha(-1) wood ash. The soil bacterial community composition changed after wood ash application with copiotrophic bacteria responding positively up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha(-1) while the adverse effect was seen for oligotrophic bacteria. Marked changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a wood ash dose of 167 t ha(-1) with a single alkaliphilic genus dominating. Additionally, spore-formers became abundant at an ash dose of 167 t ha(-1) whereas this was not the case at lower ash doses. Lastly, bacterial richness and diversity strongly decreased with increasing amount of wood ash applied. All of the observed bacterial responses can be directly explained by the wood ash induced changes in pH, electrical conductivity and the addition of wood ash inherent nutrients.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {10},
  YEAR = {1990},
  ABSTRACT = {The fungal floras of plant communities and mineral soils were determined at locations both close to and away from sites of human activity. Petroleum contaiminated soils and discarded wood which occur near Stations were also studied, the former for bacterial as well as fungal colonization. The fungal floras of uncontaminated natural communities comprised relatively few species, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum and Thelebolus microsporus being the most common, together with Epicoccum nigrum at Mawson. P. herbarum dominated the fungal floras of mosses at Mossell Lake but E. nigrum was also common in Mawson mossbeds. G. pannorum was widespread and colonized a range of different habitats, particularly in the Vestfold Hills. T. microsporus was also widespread particularly at sites frequented by birds and seals. Phialophora fastigiata was common around the Stations, especially Davis Station, in soils including those contaminated with oil and in wood, and is thought to have been introduced with softwood packing crates. A greater range of taxa including Mortierella, Mucor, Penicillium and Cladosporium spp. was recorded from Mawson Station than from other sites, and this was attributed to the effects of human activity. Few fungi but a range of bacteria were isolated from the petroleum contaminated soils. A high percentage of these soils contained bacteria which could utilize hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source. Some of these bacteria showed a strong degradative potential, namely Flavobacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp. and an isolate from the family Enterobacteriaceae. One isolate of Corynebacterium and the Enterobacteriaceae isolate were active hydrocarbon degraders at 1.degree. C. Hormoconis resinae, the imperfect state of Amorphotheca resinae was only isolated from oil spill soils and then only from sites of recent spills. Geomyces pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were less common in oil contaminated soils than in uncontaminated soils.},

  TITLE = {Vegetation changes and plant wax biomarkers from an ombrotrophic bog define hydroclimate trends and human-environment interactions during the Holocene in northern Norway},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {30},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {Holocene climate records from northern Europe improve our understanding of important North Atlantic ocean and atmospheric circulation systems to long-term insolation-driven changes, as well as more rapid forcing and feedback mechanisms. Here we assess Holocene climate and environmental changes in northern Norway based on the analysis of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, and plant wax biomarkers from a high latitude ombrotrophic bog. We define the extent and thickness of Hollabattjonnen Bog (0.16 km(2)), which is located 10 km north of Tromso. Several cores were analyzed, including a 5.16-m core that spans the last 9.5 cal ka BP. Vegetation changes from several sites were reconstructed and the distribution and hydrogen isotopic composition (delta D) ofn-alkanes (C-21-C-33) were analyzed. Our data show several distinct climate intervals that primarily indicate changes in bog surface moisture. In the early Holocene (c. 9.5-7.7 cal ka BP), wetter conditions are defined by the presence of wetland sedges and grasses, higher concentrations of mid-chain lengthn-alkanes, and a similarity in delta D values among homologs. A dry mid-Holocene (c. 7.7-3.8 cal ka BP) is inferred from the presence of a heath shrubland, low peat accumulations rates, and significant differences between delta D values of mid- and long-chain lengthn-alkanes. The late Holocene (c. 3.8 cal ka BP-present) is marked by the onset of wetter conditions, lateral bog expansion, and an increase in sedges and grasses. The Hollabattjonnen Bog record is also significant because its margins were an important location for human settlement. We correlate early Holocene environmental conditions with changes in Stone Age structures recently excavated, and we identify the occurrence of coprophilous fungi, such asSporormiellaandSordaria, likely associated with reindeer grazing activity beginning c. 1 cal ka BP. This site therefore provides important regional paleoclimate information as well as context for evaluating local prehistoric human-environment interactions.},

  ABSTRACT = {A November-December 1984 expedition to the Socompa Volcano in the Andes (24-degrees-25'S) rediscovered and described six complex autotrophic communities on geothermal warmspots near the summit at 5750 to 6060 m. These complex communities are unique in terms of their isolation, altitude, and biota, and are considered highly fragile. Environmental parameters were measured and standardized germination trials were used as bioassays of microclimate. Observations were performed on two successive ascents at a 7-d interval, with a total of 8 d recorded. The communities were composed mainly of mosses and liverworts, but included also algae, fungi, and lichens. In all, 36 taxa of bryophytes and lichens have been recognized in less than 400 m2 of vegetation. The communities formed dense patches of up to 200 m2 on warm soils (22 to 31-degrees-C at -10 cm depth) around steam vents and at cave entrances emitting vapor (9-37-degrees-C). Insects, a bird (Sicalis olivaceus), and a rodent (Phyllotis darwini rupestris) were also present. Air temperatures during the visit fluctuated between -12.1 and +9.0-degrees-C, with a daily mean of -5.5-degrees-C and a relative humidity mean of 78\%. Diurnal temperature amplitude near the surface outside warmspots was up to 31-degrees-C at +2 cm and 56-degrees-C at 0 cm. The mean vapor pressure deficit at +60 cm was 1.1 mbar with an absolute maximum of 5.5 mbar. Pan-evaporation registered over 3.5 mm d-1, but soils were moist below the surface gravel and moist up to the surface at warmspots. This characterizes a cold environment with high surface temperature amplitudes and moderate to high moisture. Hundreds of kilometers separate these patches from any possible source of diaspores, at least for most of their components.},

  TYPE = {Article},

  YEAR = {2005},
  ABSTRACT = {Winter CO, emissions from soil and snow-covered surfaces can represent a significant fraction of the annual carbon cycle in cool-temperate broad-leaved deciduous forests. The sources of this CO2 production are, however, poorly understood. To clarify the role of saprophytic microorganisms in the carbon cycle during the winter (December-April), mass loss rates of organic substrates (leaf litter and cellulose sheets), and microbial activity and fungal biomass in the litter layer of a cool-temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest in Japan were investigated. The mass loss rate of leaves reached 13\%, which accounted for 26\% of the annual mass loss. Microbial respiration in the leaf litter, measured in the laboratory. was detected even at -2 degrees C. The ergosterol content (an indicator of fungal biomass) of the cellulose sheets increased significantly in the snow-covered season. Seven genera of fungi including Varicosporium elodeae, Epicoccum purpurascens and Cylindrocarpon destructans were isolated from leaf litter collected from under snow cover. Microbial respiration during the winter was estimated based on the relationships between the amount of leaf litter available, the temperature dependency of microbial respiration and the temperature in the litter layer. The 2 microorganisms in the litter layer emitted 31 gCO(2)-C m(-2), which accounts for 38\% of the total CO2 efflux during the winter. These results suggest that through soil respiration, microorganisms in the litter layer play an important role in the carbon cycle during the winter. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {This article is the 17th in the Fungal Diversity Notes series which allows the researchers to publish fungal collections with updated reports of fungus-host and fungus-geography. Herein we report 97 taxa with four new genera distributed in three phyla (Ascomycota, Glomeromycota and Mucoromycota), 11 classes, 38 orders and 62 families collected from various regions worldwide. This collection is further classified into taxa from 69 genera with four novel genera namely Jinshana, Lithophyllospora, Parapolyplosphaeria and Stegonsporiicola. Furthermore, 71 new species, 21 new records, one new combination and four novel phylogenetic placements are provided. The new species comprise Acrocalymma estuarinum, Aggregatorygma isidiatum, Alleppeysporonites elsikii, Amphibambusa aquatica, Apiospora hongheensis, Arthrobotrys tachengensis, Calonectria potisiana, Collariella hongheensis, Colletotrichum squamosae, Corynespora chengduensis, Diaporthe beijingensis, Dicellaesporites plicatus, Dicellaesporites verrucatus, Dictyoarthrinium endophyticum, Distoseptispora chiangraiensis, Dothiora eucalypti, Epicoccum indicum, Exesisporites chandrae, Fitzroyomyces pseudopandanicola, Fomitiporia exigua, Fomitiporia rondonii, Fulvifomes subthailandicus, Gigaspora siqueirae, Gymnopus ailaoensis, Hyalorbilia yunnanensis, Hygrocybe minimiholatra, H. mitsinjoensis, H. parviholatra, H. solis, H. vintsy, Helicogermslita kunmingensis, Jinshana tangtangiae, Kirschsteiniothelia dujuanhuensis, Lamproderma subcristatum, Leucoagaricus madagascarensis, Leucocoprinus mantadiaensis, Lithophyllospora australis, Marasmius qujingensis, Melomastia aquilariae, Monoporisporites jansoniusii, M. pattersonii, Monoporisporites valdiyae, Mucispora maesotensis, Mucor soli, Muyocopron yunnanensis, Nigrospora tomentosae, Ocellularia psorirregularis, Ophiocordyceps duyunensis, Oxneriaria nigrodisca, Oxydothis aquatica, O. filiforme, Phacidiella xishuangbannaensis, Phlebiopsis subgriseofuscescens, Pleurothecium takense, Pleurotus tuber-regium, Pseudochaetosphaeronema puerensis, Pseudodactylaria guttulate, Racheliella chinensis, Rhexoacrodictys fangensis, Roussoella neoaquatica, Rubroboletus pruinosus, Sanghuangporus subzonatus, Scytalidium assmuthi, Shrungabeeja kudremukhensis, Spirographa skorinae, Stanjehughesia bambusicola, Stegonsporiicola aurantiaca, Umbelopsis hingganensis, Vararia tenuata, Verruconis pakchongensis, Wongia bandungensis, and Zygosporium cymodoceae. The new combination is Parapolyplosphaeria thailandica (equivalent to Polyplosphaeria thailandica). The 21 new hosts, geographical and habitat records comprise Acrocalymma fici, Apiculospora spartii, Aspergillus subramanianii, Camposporium ramosum, Clonostachys rogersoniana, Colletotrichum brevisporum, C. plurivorum, Collybiopsis gibbosa, Dictyosporium tratense, Distoseptispora adscendens, Exosporium livistonae, Ganoderma gibbosum, Graphis mikuraensis, Gymnosporangium paraphysatum, Lasiodiplodia thailandica, Moesziomyces bullatus, Penicillium cremeogriseum, P. echinulonalgiovense, P. javanicum, P. lanosocoeruleum, P. polonicum, and Pleurotus tuber-regium. Graphis chlorotica, G. panhalensis and G. parilis are given as novel phylogenetic placements. In addition, we provide the morphology of Tarzetta tibetensis which was missing in the previous Fungal Diversity Notes 1611-1716. Identification of characterization of all these taxa are supported by morphological and multigene phylogenetic analyses.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ice free areas of continental Antarctica are among the coldest and driest environments on Earth, and yet, they support surprisingly diverse and highly adapted microbial communities. Endolithic growth is one of the key adaptations to such extreme environments and often represents the dominant life-form. Despite growing scientific interest, little is known of the mechanisms that influence the assembly of endolithic microbiomes across these harsh environments. Here, we used metagenomics to examine the diversity and assembly of endolithic bacterial communities across Antarctica within different rock types and over a large elevation range. While granite supported richer and more heterogeneous communities than sandstone, elevation had no apparent effect on taxonomic richness, regardless of rock type. Conversely, elevation was clearly associated with turnover in community composition, with the deterministic process of variable selection driving microbial assembly along the elevation gradient. The turnover associated with elevation was modulated by geology, whereby for a given elevation difference, turnover was consistently larger between communities inhabiting different rock types. Overall, selection imposed by elevation and geology appeared stronger than turnover related to other spatially structured environmental drivers. Our findings indicate that at the cold-arid limit of life on Earth, geology and elevation are key determinants of endolithic bacterial heterogeneity. This also suggests that warming temperatures may threaten the persistence of such extreme-adapted organisms.},

  ABSTRACT = {The diversity of lichen-associated bacteria from lichen taxa Cetraria, Cladonia, Megaspora, Pseudephebe, Psoroma, and Sphaerophorus was investigated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Physiological characteristics of the cultured bacterial isolates were investigated to understand possible roles in the lichen ecosystem. Proteobacteria (with a relative abundance of 69.7-96.7\%) were mostly represented by the order Rhodospirillales. The 117 retrieved isolates were grouped into 35 phylotypes of the phyla Actinobacteria (27), Bacteroidetes (6), Deinococcus-Thermus (1), and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria (53), Betaproteobacteria (18), and Gammaproteobacteria (12)). Hydrolysis of macromolecules such as skim milk, polymer, and (hypo)xanthine, solubilization of inorganic phosphate, production of phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid, and fixation of atmospheric nitrogen were observed in different taxa. The potential phototrophy of the strains of the genus Polymorphobacter which were cultivated from a lichen for the first time was revealed by the presence of genes involved in photosynthesis. Altogether, the physiological characteristics of diverse bacterial taxa from Antarctic lichens are considered to imply significant roles of lichen-associated bacteria to allow lichens to be tolerant or competitive in the harsh Antarctic environment.},

  ABSTRACT = {The spatial patterns of plant and soil N-15 and associated processes in the N cycle were investigated at a forest-grassland boundary in northern Mongolia. Needles of Larix sibirica Ledeb. and soils collected from two study areas were analysed to calculate the differences in N-15 between needle and soil (N-15). N-15 showed a clear variation, ranging from -8 parts per thousand in the forest to -2 parts per thousand in the grassland boundary, and corresponded to the accumulation of organic layer. In the forest, the separation of available N produced in the soil with N-15-depleted N uptake by larch and N-15-enriched N immobilization by microorganisms was proposed to cause large N-15, whereas in the grassland boundary, small N-15 was explained by the transport of the most available N into larch. The divergence of available N between larch and microorganisms in the soil, and the accumulation of diverged N in the organic layer control the variation in N-15.},

  TITLE = {A Review and Analysis of Rangeland and Wildland Soil Health},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {16},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {Soil health is focused on intensively managed (IM) soils (often farmed soils), by-passing extensively managed (EM) soils (range lands, deserts, shrub lands, tundra). High economic value products are generated by IM systems. Many EM lands are of cultural, recreational, scenic, or scientific value. However, and despite the fact that they provide forage for domestic and wild animals, they are not always of high economic value. IM and EM soils are evaluated on the same health scales. The contention herein is all soils formed under soil state conditions under the absence of human interventions are inherently healthy. But a given soil has dynamic properties that determine its management as IM or EM. An EM sagebrush steppe soil may be deemed unhealthy as a result of low organic matter and short growing season. An IM grassland steppe soil is healthy as a result of high organic matter and a long growing season. The sagebrush soil, however, provides habitat for culturally important sage grouse. The grassland soil may provide, when plowed, habitat for economically important soybeans. Soil taxonomies can be used to establish inherent health of undisturbed soils. Determining a soil's dynamic nature is a different construct. Here, four different sets of EM soils were evaluated to showcase their diversity, evaluate levels of health and display their often-unconventional dynamic characteristics. An argument is made that a soil's health, an inherent condition, is not the same as its dynamic condition (potential to produce goods and services). Soil health changes are usually slowly driven by soil state factors but can be dramatically changed by humans. Otherwise, soil health can be viewed as a near constant ecosystem attribute. The dynamic nature of soils change according to needs placed by humans. EM soils may be healthy but lack attention since their dynamic nature is not traditional and often of low economic value. Evaluation of soil health and dynamic value on EM lands is often exacerbated by information absence. Strategies to circumvent this include sampling design, reference sites and standardized ways of EM soil health determination. A case is made that baselines of soil health can be taken from soil surveys, taxonomic names, and soil data from map units, where such information exists. Certified supplementary information is ambiguously available, but may be crucial. Outdoor living laboratories that feature inherent soil health and dynamic soil alternatives may help circumvent information voids.},

  ABSTRACT = {Eight new species presented are Calostoma areolatum collected in Wuyishan National Park (China), Crinipellis bidens from Hubei Province (China), Lactifluus sainii from Himalayan India, Inocybe elata from Yunnan (China), Inocybe himalayensis from Pakistan. Specimens previously identified as Massalongia carnosa represent a new species, namely M. patagonica restricted to southern South America. Saprolegnia maragheica is a new oomycete species of fresh water in Maraghe (Iran). Uncispora wuzhishanensis is a new aquatic hyphomycete species. A type specimen of Raddetes turkestanicus was studied and based on this the new combination Conocybe turkestanica, is proposed. Argyranthemum frutescens is a new host for Alternaria alternata and Syzygium cumini for Phyllosticta capitalensis in India. Crepidotus ehrendorferi is confirmed for Hungary and Pluteus leucoborealis for Central Europe, and for the phytogeographical region of Carpaticum. Pseudopithomyces palmicola is shown to occur on grapevine and it is validated by adding a unique identifier. Terfezia fanfani is reported first from Algeria.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {60},
  YEAR = {2012},
  ABSTRACT = {Bulk paleosol samples collected from a Middle to Early Miocene moraine in the New Mountain area of the Dry Valleys, Antarctica, yielded Coleoptera exoskeletons and occasional endoskeletons showing considerable diagenetic effects along with several species of bacteria, all lodged in a dry-frozen but salt-rich horizon at shallow depth to the land surface. The till is at the older end of a chronologic sequence of glacial deposits, thought to have been deposited before the transition from wet-based to cold-based ice (similar to 15 Ma), and hence, entirely weathered in contact with the subaerial atmosphere. It is possible, though not absolutely verifiable, that the skeletons date from this early stage of emplacement having undergone modifications whenever light snowmelt occurred or salt concentrations lowered the freezing temperature to maintain water as liquid. Correlation of the Coleoptera species with cultured bacteria in the sample and the likelihood of co-habitation with Beauveria bassiani found in two adjacent, although younger paleosols, leads to new questions about the antiquity of the Coleoptera and the source of N and glucose from chitinase derived from the insects. The skeletons in the 831 section may date close to the oldest preserved chitin (Oligocene) yet found on Earth. While harsh Martian conditions make it seemingly intolerable for complex, multicellular organisms such as insects to exist in the near-surface and subaerially, life within similar cold, dry paleosol microenvironments (Cryosols) of Antarctica point to life potential for the Red Planet, especially when considering the relatively diverse microbe (bacteria and fungi) population.

  ABSTRACT = {The effects of artificial ultraviolet radiation {[}UVR; 8 W m(-2) ultraviolet-A (UVA), 0.4 W m(-2) ultraviolet-B (UVB)] on photosynthetic performance, growth and the capability to synthesise mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) was investigated in the aeroterrestrial green algae Stichococcus sp. and Chlorella luteoviridis forming biofilms on building facades, and compared with the responses of two green algae, from soil (Myrmecia incisa) and brackish water (Desmodesmus subspicatus). All species exhibited decreasing quantum efficiency (F-v/F-m) after 1-3 days exposure to UVR. After 8-12 days treatment, however, all aeroterrestrial isolates exhibited full recovery under UVA and UVA/B. In contrast, D. subspicatus showed only 80\% recovery after treatment with UVB. While Stichococcus sp. and C. luteoviridis exhibited a broad tolerance in growth under all radiation conditions tested, M. incisa showed a significant decrease in growth rate after exposure to UVA and UVA/B. Similarly D. subspicatus grew with a reduced rate under UVA, but UVA/B led to full inhibition. Using HPLC, an UVabsorbing MAA (324 nm-MAA) was identified in Stichococcus sp. and C. luteoviridis. While M. incisa contained a specific 322 nm-MAA, D. subspicatus lacked any trace of such compounds. UV-exposure experiments indicated that all MAA-containing species are capable of synthesizing and accumulating these compounds, thus supporting their function as an UV-sunscreen. All data well explain the conspicuous ecological success of aeroterrestrial green algae in biofilms on facades. Biosynthesis and accumulation of MAAs under UVR seem to result in a reduced UV-sensitivity of growth and photosynthesis, which consequently may enhance survival in the environmentally harsh habitat.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {82},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {As Earth's climate warms, soil carbon pools and the microbial communities that process them may change, altering the way in which carbon is recycled in soil. In this study, we used a combination of metagenomics and bacterial cultivation to evaluate the hypothesis that experimentally raising soil temperatures by 5 degrees C for 5, 8, or 20 years increased the potential for temperate forest soil microbial communities to degrade carbohydrates. Warming decreased the proportion of carbohydrate-degrading genes in the organic horizon derived from eukaryotes and increased the fraction of genes in the mineral soil associated with Actinobacteria in all studies. Genes associated with carbohydrate degradation increased in the organic horizon after 5 years of warming but had decreased in the organic horizon after warming the soil continuously for 20 years. However, a greater proportion of the 295 bacteria from 6 phyla (10 classes, 14 orders, and 34 families) isolated from heated plots in the 20-year experiment were able to depolymerize cellulose and xylan than bacterial isolates from control soils. Together, these findings indicate that the enrichment of bacteria capable of degrading carbohydrates could be important for accelerated carbon cycling in a warmer world.},

  TITLE = {The role of microorganisms at different stages of ecosystem development for soil formation},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {10},
  YEAR = {2013},
  ABSTRACT = {Soil formation is the result of a complex network of biological as well as chemical and physical processes. The role of soil microbes is of high interest, since they are responsible for most biological transformations and drive the development of stable and labile pools of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and other nutrients, which facilitate the subsequent establishment of plant communities. Forefields of receding glaciers provide unique chronosequences of different soil development stages and are ideal ecosystems to study the interaction of bacteria, fungi and archaea with their abiotic environment. In this review we give insights into the role of microbes for soil development. The results presented are based on studies performed within the Collaborative Research Program DFG SFB/TRR 38 (http://www.tu-cottbus.de/ecosystem) and are supplemented by data from other studies. The review focusses on the microbiology of major steps of soil formation. Special attention is given to the development of nutrient cycles on the formation of biological soil crusts (BSCs) and on the establishment of plant-microbe interactions.},

  TITLE = {FungalTraits: a user-friendly traits database of fungi and fungus-like stramenopiles},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {105},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {The cryptic lifestyle of most fungi necessitates molecular identification of the guild in environmental studies. Over the past decades, rapid development and affordability of molecular tools have tremendously improved insights of the fungal diversity in all ecosystems and habitats. Yet, in spite of the progress of molecular methods, knowledge about functional properties of the fungal taxa is vague and interpretation of environmental studies in an ecologically meaningful manner remains challenging. In order to facilitate functional assignments and ecological interpretation of environmental studies we introduce a user friendly traits and character database FungalTraits operating at genus and species hypothesis levels. Combining the information from previous efforts such as FUNGuild and Fun(Fun) together with involvement of expert knowledge, we reannotated 10,210 and 151 fungal and Stramenopila genera, respectively. This resulted in a stand-alone spreadsheet dataset covering 17 lifestyle related traits of fungal and Stramenopila genera, designed for rapid functional assignments of environmental studies. In order to assign the trait states to fungal species hypotheses, the scientific community of experts manually categorised and assigned available trait information to 697,413 fungal ITS sequences. On the basis of those sequences we were able to summarise trait and host information into 92,623 fungal species hypotheses at 1\% dissimilarity threshold.},

  TYPE = {Article},

  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {Zoosporic fungi of the phylum Chytridiomycota (chytrids) regularly dominate pelagic fungal communities in freshwater and marine environments. Their lifestyles range from obligate parasites to saprophytes. Yet, linking the scarce available sequence data to specific ecological traits or their host ranges constitutes currently a major challenge. We combined 28 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with targeted isolation and sequencing approaches, along with cross-infection assays and analysis of chytrid infection prevalence to obtain new insights into chytrid diversity, ecology, and seasonal dynamics in a temperate lake. Parasitic phytoplankton-chytrid and saprotrophic pollen-chytrid interactions made up the majority of zoosporic fungal reads. We explicitly demonstrate the recurrent dominance of parasitic chytrids during frequent diatom blooms and saprotrophic chytrids during pollen rains. Distinct temporal dynamics of diatom-specific parasitic clades suggest mechanisms of coexistence based on niche differentiation and competitive strategies. The molecular and ecological information on chytrids generated in this study will aid further exploration of their spatial and temporal distribution patterns worldwide. To fully exploit the power of environmental sequencing for studies on chytrid ecology and evolution, we emphasize the need to intensify current isolation efforts of chytrids and integrate taxonomic and autecological data into long-term studies and experiments.},

  TYPE = {Article; Proceedings Paper},
  VOLUME = {93},
  YEAR = {1998},
  ABSTRACT = {Shape and physico-chemical properties of the scissile fatty acid binding sites of six lipases and two serine esterases were analyzed and compared in order to understand the molecular basis of substrate specificity. All eight serine esterases and lipases have similar architecture and catalytic mechanism of ester hydrolysis, but different substrate specificities for the acyl moiety. Lipases and esterases differ in the geometry of their binding sites, lipases have a large, hydrophobic scissile fatty acid binding site, esterases like acetylcholinesterase and bromoperoxidase have a small acyl binding pocket, which fits exactly to their favorite substrates. The lipases were subdivided into three sub-groups: (1) lipases with a hydrophobic, crevice-like binding site located near the protein surface (lipases from Rhizomucor and Rhizopus); (2) lipases with a funnel-like binding site (lipases from Candida antarctica, Pseudomonas and mammalian pancreas and cutinase); and (3) lipases with a tunnel-like binding site (lipase from Candida rugosa). The length of the scissile fatty acid binding site varies considerably among the lipases between 7.8 Angstrom in cutinase and 22 Angstrom in Candida rugosa and Rhizomucor miehei lipase. Location and properties of the scissile fatty acid binding sites of all lipases of known structure were characterized. Our model also identifies the residues which mediate chain length specificity and thus may guide protein engineering of lipases for changed chain length specificity. The model was supported by published experimental data on the chain length specificity profile of various lipases and on mutants of fungal lipases with changed fatty acid chain length specificity.

  ABSTRACT = {The aim of this study was to investigate the ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes at low temperature of yeasts isolated from 25 de Mayo island, Antarctica, and to identify those exhibiting one or more of the evaluated enzymatic activities. A total of 105 yeast isolates were obtained from different samples and 66 were identified. They belonged to 12 basidiomycetous and four ascomycetous genera. Most of the isolates were ascribed to the genera Cryptococcus, Mrakia, Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, Gueomyces, Phenoliferia, Leucosporidium, and Pichia. Results from enzymes production at low temperatures revealed that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse cultivable yeasts, which represent potential tools for biotechnological applications. While most the isolates proved to produce 2-4 of the investigated exoenzymes, two of them evidenced the six evaluated enzymatic activities: Pichia caribbica and Guehomyces pullulans, which were characterized as psycrotolerant and psycrophilic, respectively. In addition, P. caribbica could assimilate several n-alkanes and diesel fuel. The enzyme production profile and hydrocarbons assimilation capacity, combined with its high level of biomass production and the extended exponential growth phase make P. caribbica a promising tool for cold environments biotechnological purposes in the field of cold-enzymes production and oil spills bioremediation as well.},

  TITLE = {Field and lab conditions alter microbial enzyme and biomass dynamics driving decomposition of the same leaf litter},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {4},
  YEAR = {2013},
  ABSTRACT = {Fluctuations in climate and edaphic factors influence field decomposition rates and preclude a complete understanding of how microbial communities respond to plant litter quality. In contrast, laboratory microcosms isolate the intrinsic effects of litter chemistry and microbial community from extrinsic effects of environmental variation. Used together, these paired approaches provide mechanistic insights to decomposition processes. In order to elucidate the microbial mechanisms underlying how environmental conditions alter the trajectory of decay, we characterized microbial biomass, respiration, enzyme activities, and nutrient dynamics during early (<10\% mass loss), mid- (10-40\% mass loss), and late (>40\% mass loss) decay in parallel field and laboratory litter bag incubations for deciduous tree litters with varying recalcitrance (dogwood < maple < maple-oak mixture < oak). In the field, mass loss was minimal (<10\%) over the first 50 days (January February), even for labile litter types, despite above-freezing soil temperatures and adequate moisture during these winter months. In contrast, microcosms displayed high C mineralization rates in the first week. During mid-decay, the labile dogwood and maple litters in the field had higher mass loss per unit enzyme activity than the lab, possibly due to leaching of soluble compounds. Microbial biomass to litter mass (B:C) ratios peaked in the field during late decay, but B:C ratios declined between mid- and late decay in the lab. Thus, microbial biomass did not have a consistent relationship with litter quality between studies. Higher oxidative enzyme activities in oak litters in the field, and higher nitrogen (N) accumulation in the lab microcosms occurred in late decay. We speculate that elevated N suppressed fungal activity and/or biomass in microcosms. Our results suggest that differences in microbial biomass and enzyme dynamics alter the decay trajectory of the same leaf litter under field and lab conditions.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {20},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {Various microbial groups are well known to produce a range of extracellular enzymes and other secondary metabolites. However, the occurrence and importance of investment in such activities have received relatively limited attention in studies of Antarctic soil microbiota. Sixty-one yeasts strains were isolated from King George Island, Antarctica which were characterized physiologically and identified at the molecular level using the D1/D2 region of rDNA. Fifty-eight yeasts (belonging to the genera Cryptococcus, Leucosporidiella, Rhodotorula, Guehomyces, Candida, Metschnikowia and Debaryomyces) were screened for extracellular amylolytic, proteolytic, esterasic, pectinolytic, inulolytic xylanolytic and cellulolytic activities at low and moderate temperatures. Esterase activity was the most common enzymatic activity expressed by the yeast isolates regardless the assay temperature and inulinase was the second most common enzymatic activity. No cellulolytic activity was detected. One yeast identified as Guehomyces pullulans (8E) showed significant activity across six of seven enzymes types tested. Twenty-eight yeast isolates were classified as oleaginous, being the isolate 8E the strain that accumulated the highest levels of saponifiable lipids (42 \%).},

  VOLUME = {8},
  YEAR = {2020},
  ABSTRACT = {Marine yeasts can occur in a wide range of habitats, including in marine invertebrates, in which they may play important roles; however, investigation of marine yeasts in marine invertebrates is scarce. Therefore, this study aims to explore the diversity of yeasts associated with corals and zoanthids in the Gulf of Thailand. Thirty-three coral and seven zoanthid samples were collected at two sampling sites near Mu and Khram islands. Fifty yeast strains were able to be isolated from 25 of the 40 samples collected. Identification based on sequence analyses of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rRNA gene revealed a higher number of strains in the phylum Basidiomycota (68\%) than in the phylum Ascomycota. The ascomycetous yeasts comprised nine known species from four genera (Candida, Meyerozyma, Kodamaea, and Wickerhamomyces), whereas the basidiomycetous yeasts comprised 10 known species from eight genera (Vishniacozyma, Filobasidium, Naganishia, Papiliotrema, Sterigmatomyces, Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, and Rhodosporidiobolus) and one potentially new species. The species with the highest occurrence was Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) ordination, no marked differences were found in the yeast communities from the two sampling sites. The estimation of the expected richness of species was higher than the actual richness of species observed.},

  VOLUME = {12},
  YEAR = {2022},
  ABSTRACT = {Recent work examining nematode and tardigrade gut microbiomes has identified species-specific relationships between host and gut community composition. However, only a handful of species from either phylum have been examined. How microbiomes differ among species and what factors contribute to their assembly remains unexplored. Cyanobacterial mats within Antarctic Dry Valley streams host a simple and tractable natural ecosystem of identifiable microinvertebrates to address these questions. We sampled 2 types of coexisting mats (i.e., black and orange) across four spatially isolated streams, hand-picked single individuals of two nematode species (i.e., Eudorylaimus antarcticus and Plectus murrayi) and tardigrades, to examine their gut microbiomes using 16S and 18S rRNA metabarcoding. All gut microbiomes (bacterial and eukaryotic) were significantly less diverse than the mats they were isolated from. In contrast to mats, microinvertebrates' guts were depleted of Cyanobacteria and differentially enriched in taxa of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fungi. Among factors investigated, gut microbiome composition was most influenced by host identity while environmental factors (e.g., mats and streams) were less important. The importance of host identity in predicting gut microbiome composition suggests functional value to the host, similar to other organisms with strong host selected microbiomes.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {125},
  YEAR = {2018},
  ABSTRACT = {Agricultural mulch films made from biodegradable polymers (BP) have been used to decrease the burden of plastic waste recovery and recycling. However, their degradations depend largely on environmental conditions and sometimes do not proceed as desired. Yeast strains of Pseudozyma antarctica often isolated from rice husks were found to secrete an esterase to degrade BP films. Poly-butylene succinate-co-adipate (PBSA) films buried in unsterilized rice husks with 60\% (w/w) moisture degraded rapidly compared to that buried in field soil. The type strain of P. antarctica JCM 10317 added as cell suspension onto sterilized rice husks with PBSA film grew rapidly forming filamentous growth on the surface of rice husks and films. BP-degrading enzyme secreted by the growing cells was adsorbed on the surface of film and decomposed the film. Addition of rice husk-derived P. antarctica strains also showed BP film degradation activity in sterilized rice husks. In the light of these findings, we suggest that techniques for disposal of used BPs which combine plastics with unutilized residual plant materials piled at the side of agricultural fields be developed.

  YEAR = {2006},
  ABSTRACT = {In 1981, four fungal isolates from hair of the European badger (Meles meles) were examined by Dr Phyllis Stockdale at the Commonwealth Mycological Institute, Kew, and deposited in the UK National Collection of Pathogenic Fungi as an undescribed member of the Trichophyton terrestre complex. The present paper formalizes the complete description of a new ascomycete taxon, Arthroderma olidum following successful recent attempts to re-isolate the same fungus from the soil of Badger holes in South West England. Furthermore, using ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we show that the asexual form of A. olidum is conspecific with the recently described Trichophyton eboreum {[}1] isolated from a human skin specimen in Germany.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {14},
  YEAR = {1982},
  ABSTRACT = {Seasonal variations in temperature and moisture in moss peat were monitored in the field at Signy Island, Antarctica. When simulated in intact peat cores in vitro after frozen storage, these variations caused changes on O2 uptake which closely reproduced the results for fresh samples. Respiration rate was used as a measure of aerobic decomposer activity. Supplements of sugars indicated the predominance of microbial respiration and its dependence on the availability of dissolved organic C (DOC). Low temperatures of 0.degree. to 1.degree. C were not rate-limiting for respiration in vivo or in vitro, and O2 uptake was detected at -1.degree. C. Repeated peaks of O2-uptake under wet conditions resulting from simulated spring freeze-thaw cycles, and a solitary peak during an autumn simulation, suggested release of DOC substrares from frost-damaged cells. Desiccation, microfaunal predation and microaerophily were thought to contribute to respiratory declines. O2-uptake and CO2-evolution were equivalent in peat beneath Polytrichum sampled in autumn. Peat respiration was not generally proportional to microbial biomass, but saccharolytic yeasts were dominant during the respiratory maximum in spring and correlated with O2-uptake in a mixed culture of indigenous microflora. Yeasts grew exponentially in freeze thaw cycle stimulations but percolated into the peat profile in the field. The basal O2 uptake, which may be attributable to the decomposition of recalcitrant molecules such as cellulose, was lower in simulations of spring than autumn. Although bacterial biomass increased and diversified during summer, the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial contributions to O2-uptake in an incubated homogenate of peat sampled in autumn was 4:1.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {3},
  YEAR = {2001},
  ABSTRACT = {An investigation was made into the occurrence and biodiversity of Geodermatophilaceae on 78 samples of altered stone surfaces from 24 monuments and natural stones in the Mediterranean basin; it was found that the total microbial counts ranged between 0 and 10(7) cfu g(-1) dry weight. Members of the Geodermatophilaceae family were isolated from 22 of the 78 samples examined, with the incidence of Geodermatophilaceae colonies in the cultivable population ranging from 1\% to 100\%. The highest percentage was found in six samples of markedly deteriorated stone. Sixty-five strains randomly isolated from the plates were clustered in six different groups by amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) using five different restriction enzymes. Twenty-five strains, representing all the ARDRA haplotypes, were characterized further by partial sequencing (350-550 bp) of the 16S rDNA and by analysing 76 morphological, metabolic and physiological properties. The strains were associated with three well-separated clusters of the genera Geodermatophilus, Blastococcus and Modestobacter. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequence and ARDRA analysis, only two strains were found to be related to the two reference strains of Geodermatophilus. All the others could be grouped with Blastococcus aggregatus (19 strains) or the Antarctic species Modestobacter multiseptatus (44 strains), suggesting that it is these two groups, rather than Geodermatophilus, that tend to colonize the stone surfaces, and that Modestobacter-like strains are also found in temperate/Mediterranean climates. From the BOX-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data, it can be seen that the Modestobacter-like strains, belonging to the most represented ARDRA haplotype (haplotype B, 34 strains), are very polymorphic and that, over a stone surface, there is a wide genetic diversity at the microsite level.},

  VOLUME = {102},

  ABSTRACT = {In sampling soils to survey dictyostelid cellular slime molds in Alaska we encountered two groups of isolates that have morphologies that differ from any previously described species within their group. We sequenced the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) of selected isolates from the two groups and found sequences from both groups to be distinct from all previously described dictyostelid sequences. Phylogenetic analyses place one novel species in dictyostelid Group 2 and the other in Group 4 (Schaap et al. 2006). In this paper we formally describe as new these two species of cellular slime molds, Dictyostelium ammophilum sp. nov. and Dictyostelium borealesp. nov., based on the combination of morphological and molecular characters.},

  ABSTRACT = {Polar glacier forefields offer an unprecedented framework for studying community assembly processes in regions that are geographically and climatically isolated. Through amplicon sequence variant (ASV) inference, we compared the composition and structure of soil bacterial communities from glacier forefields in Iceland and Antarctica to assess overlap between communities and the impact of established cryptogamic covers on the uniqueness of their taxa. These pioneer microbial communities were found to share only 8\% of ASVs and each taxonomic group's contribution to the shared ASV data subset was heterogeneous and independent of their relative abundance. Although the presence of ASVs specific to one glacier forefield and/or different cryptogam cover values confirms the existence of habitat specialist bacteria, our data show that the influence of cryptogams on the edaphic bacterial community structure also varied also depending on the taxonomic group. Hence, the establishment of distinct cryptogamic covers is probably not the only factor driving the uniqueness of bacterial communities at both poles. The structure of bacterial communities colonising deglaciated areas seems also conditioned by lineage-specific limitations in their dispersal capacity and/or their establishment and persistence in these isolated and hostile regions.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {60},
  YEAR = {2014},
  ABSTRACT = {Environmental factors influencing the occurrence and community structure of soil yeasts in forests are not well studied. There are few studies dedicated to Southern Hemisphere soil yeasts populations and even fewer focused on temperate forests influenced by volcanic activity. The present work aimed to study the ecology of soil yeast communities from pristine forests influenced by different environmental factors (precipitation, physicochemical properties of soil, tree species, soil region, and season). The survey was performed in 4 northern Patagonian forests: 2 dominated by Nothofagus pumilio and 2 by Nothofagus antarctica. Yeast communities were described with ecological indices and species accumulation curves, and their association with environmental characteristics was assessed using multivariate analysis. Each forest site showed a particular arrangement of species as a result of environmental characteristics, such as dominant plant species, nutrient availability, and climatic characteristics. Cryptococcus podzolicus was most frequently isolated in nutrient-rich soils, Trichosporon porosum dominated cold mountain forests with low nutrient and water availability in soil, and capsulated yeasts such as Cryptococcus phenolicus dominated forest sites with low precipitation. The present work suggests that environmental factors affecting yeast communities may not be the current soil characteristics but the result of complex interactions of factors including natural disturbances like volcanic activity.},

  TITLE = {Cold-stress responses in the Antarctic basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia blollopis},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {3},
  YEAR = {2016},
  ABSTRACT = {Microbes growing at subzero temperatures encounter numerous growth constraints. However, fungi that inhabit cold environments can grow and decompose organic compounds under subzero temperatures. Thus, understanding the cold-adaptation strategies of fungi under extreme environments is critical for elucidating polar-region ecosystems. Here, I report that two strains of the Antarctic basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia blollopis exhibited distinct growth characteristics under subzero conditions: SK-4 grew efficiently, whereas TKG1-2 did not. I analysed the metabolite responses elicited by cold stress in these two M. blollopis strains by using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. M. blollopis SK-4, which grew well under subzero temperatures, accumulated high levels of TCA-cycle metabolites, lactic acid, aromatic amino acids and polyamines in response to cold shock. Polyamines are recognized to function in cell-growth and developmental processes, and aromatic amino acids are also known to improve cell growth at low temperatures. By contrast, in TKG1-2, which did not grow efficiently, cold stress strongly induced the metabolites of the TCA cycle, but other metabolites were not highly accumulated in the cell. Thus, these differences in metabolite responses could contribute to the distinct abilities of SK-4 and TKG1-2 cells to grow under subzero temperature conditions.},

  TITLE = {ParAquaSeq, a Database of Ecologically Annotated rRNA Sequences Covering Zoosporic Parasites Infecting Aquatic Primary Producers in Natural and Industrial Systems},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {25},
  YEAR = {2025},
  ABSTRACT = {Amplicon sequencing tools such as metabarcoding are commonly used for thorough characterisation of microbial diversity in natural samples. They mostly rely on the amplification of conserved universal markers, mainly ribosomal genes, allowing the taxonomic assignment of barcodes. However, linking taxonomic classification with functional traits is not straightforward and requires knowledge of each taxonomic group to confidently assign taxa to a given functional trait. Zoosporic parasites are highly diverse and yet understudied, with many undescribed species and host associations. However, they can have important impacts on host populations in natural ecosystems (e.g., controlling harmful algal blooms), as well as on industrial-scale algae production, e.g. aquaculture, causing their collapse or economic losses. Here, we present ParAquaSeq, a curated database of available molecular ribosomal sequences belonging to zoosporic parasites infecting aquatic vascular plants, macroalgae and photosynthetic microorganisms, i.e. microalgae and cyanobacteria. These sequences are aligned with ancillary data and other information currently available, including details on their hosts, occurrence, culture availability and associated bibliography. The database includes 1131 curated sequences from marine, freshwater and industrial or artificial environments, and belonging to 13 different taxonomic groups, including Chytridiomycota, Oomycota, Phytomyxea, and Syndiniophyceae. The curated database will allow a comprehensive analysis of zoosporic parasites in molecular datasets to answer questions related to their occurrence and distribution in natural communities. Especially through meta-analysis, the database serves as a valuable tool for developing effective mitigation and sustainable management strategies in the algae biomass industry, but it will also help to identify knowledge gaps for future research.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microbial consortia are a promising alternative to monocultures of genetically modified microorganisms for complex biotransformations. We developed a versatile consortium-based strategy for the direct conversion of lignocellulose to short-chain fatty acids, which included the funneling of the lignocellulosic carbohydrates to lactate as a central intermediate in engineered food chains. A spatial niche enabled in situ cellulolytic enzyme production by an aerobic fungus next to facultative anaerobic lactic acid bacteria and the product-forming anaerobes. Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Veillonella criceti, or Megasphaera elsdenii were integrated into the lactate platform to produce 196 kilograms of butyric acid per metric ton of beechwood. The lactate platform demonstrates the benefits of mixed cultures, such as their modularity and their ability to convert complex substrates into valuable biochemicals.},

  ABSTRACT = {The importance of biogeochemical processes in the morphogenic system of periglacial environments has been underestimated for decades. Weathering rind studies help to characterise and quantify biogeochemical weathering over time. Experiments using fungi strains isolated from basaltic boulders allow one to decipher biological weathering. A historical approach using heterochronous moraines provides the opportunity to follow the life of weathering rinds and helps to build a chronology of dominant processes of weathering during the first century of exposure. It appears that exfoliation of weathering rinds, commonly observed on boulders, is the result of a combination of both biogeochemical and physical processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {11},
  YEAR = {2009},
  ABSTRACT = {Although viable fungi have been recovered from a wide variety of icy environments, their metabolic capabilities under frozen conditions are still largely unknown. We investigated basidiomycetous yeasts isolated from an Antarctic ice core and showed that after freezing at a relatively slow rate (0.8 degrees C min(-1)), the cells are excluded into veins of liquid at the triple junctions of ice crystals. These strains were capable of reproductive growth at -5 degrees C under liquid conditions. Under frozen conditions, metabolic activity was assessed by measuring rates of {[}H-3]leucine incorporation into the acid-insoluble macromolecular fraction, which decreased exponentially at temperatures between 15 degrees C and -15 degrees C and was inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Experiments at -5 degrees C under frozen and liquid conditions revealed 2-3 orders of magnitude lower rates of endogenous metabolism in ice, likely due to the high salinity in the liquid fraction of the ice (equivalent of approximate to 1.4 mol l(-1) of NaCl at -5 degrees C). The mesophile Saccharomyces cerevisae also incorporated {[}H-3]leucine at -5 degrees C and -15 degrees C, indicating that this activity is not exclusive to cold-adapted microorganisms. The ability of yeast cells to incorporate amino acid substrates into macromolecules and remain metabolically active under these conditions has implications for understanding the survival of Eukarya in icy environments.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {10},
  YEAR = {2011},
  ABSTRACT = {Biodiesel has been regarded as a biodegradable and non-polluting fuel. Enzymatic transesterification reaction for manufacturing biodiesel from vegetable oils with alcohol is an attractive approach. However, the cost of enzyme remains a barrier for its industrial implementation. The aim of this research was the screening of lipase-producing microorganisms and the studies of potential lipase-mediated biodiesel production using palm oil as substrate. A total of 360 strains of bacteria, yeasts and fungi were isolated and screened from the samples of oil-contaminated soil and waste water. Among all the screened microbes, the potential lipolytic bacterium, Staphylococcus warneri, unicellular yeast, Candida rugosa and filamentous fungus, Fusarium solani were selected because of their high specific activities. The lipase-producing conditions were subsequently optimized by using palm oil as an inducer and lipase activities were compared for both hydrolytic and synthetic catalysis. C. rugosa lipase, which exhibited the highest potential for catalyzing the biodiesel production, was further purified and immobilized on various hydrophobic supports. The catalysis of transesterification between methanol and palm oil by the C. rugosa immobilized lipases revealed that immobilized lipase from C. rugosa on Sepabeads EC-OD was the most promising for further development as a biocatalyst for the application of enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel synthesis.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {308},
  YEAR = {2025},
  ABSTRACT = {Chitinase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds in chitin, holds significant potential for industrial applications, including biological control, antifungal treatments, and antibiofilm strategies. In this study, chitinase derived from Planomicrobium sp. (PP133202) was immobilized onto a cobalt metal-organic framework (CoMOF), and its properties were extensively analyzed using various biological, chemical, and physical characterization techniques. The microbial source was identified via 16S rRNA sequencing, and enzyme activity was optimized under submerged conditions using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Structural and morphological characterization of the chitinase/Co-MOF complex was conducted through FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD, EDX, and surface area analyses. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were determined to be 42 \% and 20 \%, respectively. Notably, the immobilized chitinase exhibited a threefold increase in enzymatic activity compared to its free form. Additionally, the chitinase/Co-MOF complex demonstrated enhanced biological control efficacy, effectively inhibiting Tribolium castaneum and multiple pathogenic microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus, and Beauveria bassiana. These findings highlight the potential of chitinase/Co-MOF as a promising agent for antimicrobial and pest control applications.},

  ABSTRACT = {This study re-evaluates the classification of the Lulworthiomycetidae based on phylogenetic analyses of 18S, 28S and ITS (internal transcribed spacers and 5.8S) regions of rDNA and protein coding genes (TEF1 alpha, RPB1, RPB2, TUB2, MCM7) along with comprehensive morphological comparisons. Based on the current phylogenetic data we consider the genus Spathulospora as a member of the Lulworthiales, Lulworthiomycetidae, and redundancy of the taxon Spathulosporales. This study confirms Lulworthia as polyphyletic with the characteristic filiform, long ascospores with an end chamber, which is found in many genera: Halazoon, Halophilomyces, Lulwoana, Lulwoidea, Matsusporium, Paralulworthia, Paramoleospora, Rostrupiella, and Sammeyersia. These genera can be distinguished by morphology, their asexual morphs and molecular phylogeny. The Lulworthiomycetidae includes 23 genera and 69 species. One new genus (Lindriella) and eight new species (Hydea mangrovei, Lulworthia norwegica, Matsusporium japonica, Moromyces mangrovis, Paralulworthia lignicola, Rostrupiella longispora, Sammeyersia yanbuensis, S. thailandica) are introduced, with four new combinations.},

  ABSTRACT = {A lipase producing strain B1213 isolated from soil was identified as Burkholderia pyrrocinia based on 16S rRNA gene and recA sequeence analysis, making this the first report on the presence of a lipase from B. pyrrocinia. Under an aqueous two-phase purification strategy, which included (ATPE)-ion-exchange chromatography (IEC)-gel and filtration chromatography (GFC), the specific activity of the 35-kDa lipase was determined to be 875.7 U/mg protein. The optimum pH and temperature of this lipase was pH 8.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The lipase retained > 85\% activity in isopropanol and acetone at 30 degrees C for 10 mM but the activity was reduced to 10.6\% in n-hexane. Mg2+, Al3+, Mn2+, and Fe3+ enhanced lipase activity at both 1 mM and 5 mM concentrations. p-NPP, a long-chain acyl group 4-NP ester, appeared to be a good substrate candidate.},

  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {90},
  YEAR = {1998},
  ABSTRACT = {During the period of early February to early April of 1995, samples for isolation of dictyostelid cellular slime molds were collected from representative examples of all major types of plant communities found on subantarctic Macquarie Island. These included tussock grassland, short grassland, herbfield, fernbrake, mire, and feldmark communities. There are apparently no previous reports of dictyostelids from the south polar region, but Dictyostelium mucoroides was recovered from soil/litter and/ or recovered from soil/litter and/or litter samples collected in tussock grassland, herbfield, and fernbrake communities. Densities were almost invariably low (<50 colony-forming units/g), but one study site yielded 135 colony-forming units/g. The most diverse plant communities on Macquarie are mixed herbfield communities that occur on raised coastal terraces, and the majority of positive samples were collected from these communities. No dictyostelids were recovered from samples collected at higher elevations (generally >200 m) on the main plateau of the island. In general, both frequency of occurrence and density were higher for samples of moist, decomposing litter found around land sometimes still attached to) the bases of such plants as Pleurophyllum hookeri and Stilbocarpa polaris than for samples collected from the soil/litter interface zone.},

  TITLE = {Outdoor climate drives diversity patterns of dominant microbial taxa in caves worldwide},
  TYPE = {Article},
  VOLUME = {906},
  YEAR = {2024},
  ABSTRACT = {The cave microbiota is assumed to be shaped by indoor microclimate, biotic and abiotic factors, which are largely dependent from outside environmental conditions; however, this knowledge is available at local or regional scales only. To address this knowledge gap, we reanalyzed over 1050 bacterial and fungal communities of caves worldwide, and found that outdoor temperature and rainfall play a critical role in explaining differences in microbial diversity patterns of global caves, selecting specific dominant taxa across gradients of growing aridity conditions with arid climate leading to a reduction in total cave microbial diversity. Moreover, we found that fungal (from 186 to 1908 taxa) and bacterial (from 467 to 1619 taxa) diversity increased under temperate-tropical and temperate-continental climatic regions, respectively, highlighting an opposite preference for the two microbial compartments. We hypothesized that outdoor geographical, climatic variables and lithology are critical epistatic drivers in assembling microbial communities and their dominant taxa, whose ecological responses could be useful to predict the fate of these subterranean environments in the context of climate change. Our work elucidates the intimate connection between caves microbiota and surface ecosystems highlighting the sensitivity of cave microbial communities to climatic changes and environmental degradation. This work also provides a natural benchmark for the biogeographic information for caves globally and for protection strategies aiming at conservation of underground environments.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background A key component of achieving universal health coverage is ensuring that all populations have access to quality health care. Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 1990 to 2016. Methods Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0-100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita. Findings In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97.1 (95\% UI 95.8-98.1) in Iceland, followed by 96.6 (94.9-97.9) in Norway and 96.1 (94.5-97.3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18.6 (13.1-24.4) in the Central African Republic, 19.0 (14.3-23.7) in Somalia, and 23.4 (20.2-26.8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91.5 (89.1-936) in Beijing to 48.0 (43.4-53.2) in Tibet (a 43.5-point difference), while India saw a 30.8-point disparity, from 64.8 (59.6-68.8) in Goa to 34.0 (30.3-38.1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4.8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20.9-point to 17.0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17.2-point to 20.4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries. Interpretation GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view and subsequent provision of quality health care for all populations.

  ABSTRACT = {Document recommendation systems for locating relevant literature have mostly relied on methods developed a decade ago. This is largely due to the lack of a large offline gold-standard benchmark of relevant documents that cover a variety of research fields such that newly developed literature search techniques can be compared, improved and translated into practice. To overcome this bottleneck, we have established the RElevant LIterature SearcH consortium consisting of more than 1500 scientists from 84 countries, who have collectively annotated the relevance of over 180 000 PubMed-listed articles with regard to their respective seed (input) article/s. The majority of annotations were contributed by highly experienced, original authors of the seed articles. The collected data cover 76\% of all unique PubMed Medical Subject Headings descriptors. No systematic biases were observed across different experience levels, research fields or time spent on annotations. More importantly, annotations of the same document pairs contributed by different scientists were highly concordant. We further show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles, suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture all relevant articles. The established database server located at https://relishdb.ict.griffith.edu.au is freely available for the downloading of annotation data and the blind testing of new methods. We expect that this benchmark will be useful for stimulating the development of new powerful techniques for title and title/abstract-based search engines for relevant articles in biomedical research.},
