	abstract = {Abstract: Potential to produce inducible enzymes (several hydrolases and oxidases) and antibiotics as secondary metabolites was studied in soil micromycete strains from the Arctic (Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya) and Antarctica (the oases Thala Hills, Larsemann Hills, Schirmacher, and Marie Byrd Land). Maximal esterase activity was observed in strains of two typical Antarctic species, Hyphozyma variabilis 218 and Thelebolus ellipsoideus 210 (51 and 29 nmol {FDA}/((g mycelium h), respectively). Cellulolytic activity was maximal (89 µmol glucose/mg biomass) in Ascochyta pisi 192. Extracellular phenol oxidase (laccase) and peroxidase activities were not detected in the strains examined. Antibacterial activity toward Bacillus subtilis {ATCC} 6633 was observed in 75\% of the Antarctic micromycete strains. Higher-activity strains were isolated from organic-rich moist habitats with a moss or lichen cover. Maximal activities were displayed by Paecilomyces marquandii 166, Penicillium janczewskii 165, Penicillium roseopurpureum 169, and Thelebolus ellipsoideus 210. Antagonistic activity toward Antarctic bacterial strains was shown by 77\% of the microfungal strains examined. Maximal inhibition was observed with strains of the typical Antarctic species Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus {MT}303855 and the eurytopic species Sarocladium kiliense {MT}303856. Antimycotic activity was observed in 42\% of the strains. Both activities were detected in 38\% of the Antarctic strains. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},
