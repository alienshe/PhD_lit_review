  ABSTRACT = {Rapid climate change in the Arctic is altering microbial structure and function, with important consequences for the global ecosystem. Emerging evidence suggests organisms in higher trophic levels may also influence microbial communities, but whether warming alters these effects is unclear. Wolf spiders are dominant Arctic predators whose densities are expected to increase with warming. These predators have temperature-dependent effects on decomposition via their consumption of fungal-feeding detritivores, suggesting they may indirectly affect the microbial structure as well. To address this, we used a fully factorial mesocosm experiment to test the effects of wolf spider density and warming on litter microbial structure in Arctic tundra. We deployed replicate litter bags at the surface and belowground in the organic soil profile and analyzed the litter for bacterial and fungal community structure, mass loss, and nutrient characteristics after 2 and 14 months. We found there were significant interactive effects of wolf spider density and warming on fungal but not bacterial communities. Specifically, higher wolf spider densities caused greater fungal diversity under ambient temperature but lower fungal diversity under warming at the soil surface. We also observed interactive treatment effects on fungal composition belowground. Wolf spider density influenced surface bacterial composition, but the effects did not change with warming. These findings suggest a widespread predator can have indirect, cascading effects on litter microbes and that effects on fungi specifically shift under future expected levels of warming. Overall, our study highlights that trophic interactions may play important, albeit overlooked, roles in driving microbial responses to warming in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems.

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctic soils provide an excellent setting to test biogeographical patterns across spatial and environmental scales given their relatively simple communities and the dominance of physical factors that create strong environmental gradients. Additional urgency is given by the fact that their unique terrestrial communities are the subject of conservation efforts in a rapidly changing environment. We investigated relationships of soil community assembly and alpha and beta diversity with climatic and environmental parameters across regional and local scales in Maritime Antarctica. We sampled from a regional gradient of sites that differ in habitat severity, ranging from relatively favourable to harsher physicochemical conditions. At the regional scale, bacterial community characteristics and microarthropod abundance varied along this severity gradient, but most measures of fungal communities did not. Microarthropod and microbial communities differed in which soil and climate parameters were most influential, and the specific parameters that influenced each taxon differed across broad and fine spatial scales. This suggests that conservation efforts will need to focus on a large variety of habitat characteristics to successfully encompass diversity across taxa. Because beta diversity was the result of species turnover, conservation efforts also cannot focus on only the most biodiverse sites to effectively preserve all aspects of biodiversity.

  ABSTRACT = {The influence of climate change on microbial communities inhabiting the sparsely vegetated patterned ground soils that are widespread across the High Arctic is poorly understood. Here, in a four-year experiment on Svalbard, we warmed patterned ground soil with open top chambers and biannually irrigated the soil to predict the responses of its microbial community to rising temperatures and precipitation. A 1 °C rise in summertime soil temperature caused 44% and 78% increases in CO2 efflux and CH4 consumption, respectively, and a 32% increase in the frequency of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Bacterial alpha diversity was unaffected by the treatments, but, of the 40 most frequent bacterial taxa, warming caused 44–45% reductions in the relative abundances of a Sphingomonas sp. and Ferruginibacter sp. and 33–91% increases in those of a Phenylobacterium sp. and a member of the Acetobacteraceae. Warming did not influence the frequency of fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 copies, and irrigation had no effects on the measured variables. Our study suggests rapid changes to the activities and abundances of microbes, and particularly bacteria, in High Arctic patterned ground soils as they warm. At current rates of soil warming on Svalbard (0.8 °C per decade), we anticipate that similar effects to those reported here will manifest themselves in the natural environment by approximately the mid 2030s. © 2022 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Glacier retreat in cold regions exposes new terrain for plant colonization. However, the roles of soil microbiomes in plant establishment and performance on newly-exposed forefields have rarely been assessed. Here, we compared the survival of Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) individuals grown for three years in sterilised and unsterilised soils at sites initially at 30 m, 100 m and 300 m from three retreating Maritime Antarctic glaciers. We also installed open top chambers (OTCs), which increased air temperatures by ∼1.8 °C and reduced soil water potential by ≤ 4 kPa, on one forefield to test the effects of warming on C. quitensis survival and the soil microbiome. The main driver of plant performance was distance from glacier fronts, with a 32 kPa reduction in soil water potential apparently explaining reduced plant survival at 300m compared with 30 m from glaciers. Soil sterilisation had few effects on plant survival at 30 m and 100 m, but reduced survival at 300 m, which was attributable to reductions in beneficial plant-microbial interactions. Effects of OTCs on plant survival were amplified with distance from glacier and sterilisation, with plants not surviving in chambered and sterilised soil at 300 m after three years. Soil bacterial functionality altered from a phototrophic community at 30 m to a more specialized chemoheterotrophic community at 100–300 m. Fungal ortholog groups showed transfer RNA and ribosome biogenesis to be enriched in soil at 30 m, with spliceosomes and messenger RNA synthesis being more frequent at 300 m. We propose that soil microbiomes improve the environmental tolerance of C. quitensis through enhanced physiological performance, which in turn improves survival and facilitates the species’ colonization of newly-exposed glacier forefield soils. These plant-microbe interactions are likely to become increasingly important as the climate of Maritime Antarctica changes over future decades. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

  ABSTRACT = {Climate change predictions suggest that arctic and subarctic ecosystems will be particularly affected by rising temperatures and extreme weather events, including severe heat waves. Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors controlling and regulating microbial decomposition in soils; therefore, it is critical to understand its impact on soil microorganisms and their feedback to climate warming. We conducted a warming experiment in a subarctic birch forest in North Sweden to test the effects of summer heat waves on the thermal trait distributions that define the temperature dependences for microbial growth and respiration. We also determined the microbial temperature dependences 10 and 12 months after the heat wave simulation had ended to investigate the persistence of the thermal trait shifts. As a result of warming, the bacterial growth temperature dependence shifted to become warm-adapted, with a similar trend for fungal growth. For respiration, there was no shift in the temperature dependence. The shifts in thermal traits were not accompanied by changes in α- or β-diversity of the microbial community. Warming increased the fungal-to-bacterial growth ratio by 33% and decreased the microbial carbon use efficiency by 35%, and both these effects were caused by the reduction in moisture the warming treatments caused, while there was no evidence that substrate depletion had altered microbial processes. The warm-shifted bacterial thermal traits were partially restored within one winter but only fully recovered to match ambient conditions after 1 year. To conclude, a summer heat wave in the Subarctic resulted in (i) shifts in microbial thermal trait distributions; (ii) lower microbial process rates caused by decreased moisture, not substrate depletion; and (iii) no detectable link between the microbial thermal trait shifts and community composition changes. © 2023 The Authors.

  ABSTRACT = {The majority of islands surrounding the Antarctic continent are poorly characterized in terms of microbial macroecology due to their remote locations, geographical isolation and access difficulties. The 2016/2017 Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) provided unprecedented access to a number of these islands. In the present study we use metagenomic methods to investigate the microbial ecology of soil samples recovered from 11 circum-Antarctic islands as part of ACE, and to investigate the functional potential of their soil microbial communities. Comparisons of the prokaryote and lower eukaryote phylogenetic compositions of the soil communities indicated that the various islands harbored spatially distinct microbiomes with limited overlap. In particular, we identified a high prevalence of lichen-associated fungal taxa in the soils, suggesting that terrestrial lichens may be one of the key drivers of soil microbial ecology on these islands. Differential abundance and redundancy analyses suggested that these soil microbial communities are also strongly shaped by multiple abiotic factors, including soil pH and average annual temperatures. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the islands sampled in this study can be clustered into three distinct large-scale biogeographical regions in a conservation context, the sub-, Maritime and Continental Antarctic, which are distinct in both environmental conditions and microbial ecology, but are consistent with the widely-used regionalization applied to multicellular Antarctic terrestrial organisms. Functional profiling of the island soil metagenomes from these three broad biogeographical regions also suggested a degree of functional differentiation, reflecting their distinct microbial ecologies. Taken together, these results represent the most extensive characterization of the microbial ecology of Antarctic island soils to date. © 2023 The Authors.

  ABSTRACT = {The study of chronosequences is an effective tool to study the effects of environmental changes or disturbances on microbial community structures, diversity, and the functional properties of ecosystems. Here, we conduct a chronosequence study on the Ardley Island coastal terrace of the Fildes Peninsula, Maritime Antarctica. The results revealed that prokaryotic microorganism communities changed orderly among the six successional stages. Some marine microbial groups could still be found in near-coastal soils of the late stage (lowest stratum). Animal pathogenic bacteria and stress-resistant microorganisms occurred at the greatest level with the longest succession period. The main driving factors for the succession of bacteria, archaea, and fungi along Ardley Island terrace were found through Adonis analysis (PERMANOVA). During analysis, soil elements Mg, Si, and Na were related to the bacterial and archaeal community structure discrepancies, while Al, Ti, K, and Cl were related to the fungal community structure discrepancies. On the other hand, other environmental factors also play an important role in the succession of microbial communities, which could be different among each microorganism. The succession of bacterial communities is greatly affected by pH and water content; archaeal communities are greatly affected by (Formula presented.) ; fungal communities are affected by nutrients such as (Formula presented.). In the analysis of the characteristic microorganisms along terrace, the succession of microorganisms was found to be influenced by complex and comprehensive factors. For instance, environmental instability, relationship with plants and ecological niches, and environmental tolerance. The results found that budding reproduction and/or with filamentous appendages bacteria were enriched in the late stage, which might be connected to its tolerance to rapid changes and barren environments. In addition, the decline in ammonia oxidation capacity of Thaumarchaeota archaeade with succession and the evolution of the fungi-plant relationship throughout classes were revealed. Overall, this research improves the understanding of the effect of the marine–to–terrestrial transition of the Ardley Island terrace on microbial communities. These findings will lay the foundation for more in-depth research regarding microbial adaptations and evolutionary mechanisms throughout the marine–terrestrial transition in the future.

  ABSTRACT = {Climate warming is causing widespread deglaciation and pioneer soil formation over glacial deposits. Melting glaciers expose rocky terrain and glacial till sediment that is relatively low in biomass, oligotrophic, and depleted in nutrients. Following initial colonization by microorganisms, glacial till sediments accumulate organic carbon and nutrients over time. However, the mechanisms driving soil nutrient stabilization during early pedogenesis after glacial retreat remain unclear. Here, we traced amino acid uptake by microorganisms in recently deglaciated high-Arctic soils and show that fungi play a critical role in the initial stabilization of the assimilated carbon. Pioneer basidiomycete yeasts were among the predominant taxa responsible for carbon assimilation, which were associated with overall high amino acid use efficiency and reduced respiration. In intermediate- and late-stage soils, lichenized ascomycete fungi were prevalent, but bacteria increasingly dominated amino acid assimilation, with substantially decreased fungal:bacterial amino acid assimilation ratios and increased respiration. Together, these findings demonstrate that fungi are important drivers of pedogenesis in high-Arctic ecosystems that are currently subject to widespread deglaciation from global warming.

  ABSTRACT = {Highly simplified microbial communities colonise rocks and soils of continental Antarctica ice-free deserts. These two habitats impose different selection pressures on organisms, yet the possible filtering effects on the diversity and composition of microbial communities have not hitherto been fully characterised. We hence compared fungal communities in rocks and soils in three localities of inner Victoria Land. We found low fungal diversity in both substrates, with a mean species richness of 28 across all samples, and significantly lower diversity in rocks than in soils. Rock and soil communities were strongly differentiated, with a multinomial species classification method identifying just three out of 328 taxa as generalists with no affinity for either substrate. Rocks were characterised by a higher abundance of lichen-forming fungi (typically Buellia, Carbonea, Pleopsidium, Lecanora, and Lecidea), possibly owing to the more protected environment and the porosity of rocks permitting photosynthetic activity. In contrast, soils were dominated by obligate yeasts (typically Naganishia and Meyerozyma), the abundances of which were correlated with edaphic factors, and the black yeast Cryomyces. Our study suggests that strong differences in selection pressures may account for the wide divergences of fungal communities in rocks and soils of inner Victoria Land. © 2023 The Authors.

  ABSTRACT = {Soil microorganisms regulate the decomposition of organic matter. However, microbial activities can also be rate-limited by the resource in lowest supply. Arctic ecosystems are being exposed to pronounced climate warming, with arctic greening, treeline advance and shrubification resulting in increased plant-derived carbon (C) inputs to soils, and faster rates of decomposition releasing mineral nutrients, potentially shifting the limiting factor for microbial growth. Here we used a “space-for-time” approach across a subarctic ecotone (birch forest, tree line, shrub and tundra sites). N and P fertilization treatments were also applied in the field, to test whether changes in resource limitation could be induced through nutrient loading of soils. In these soils, we measured the responses of bacterial and fungal growth as well as soil respiration to full factorial additions of C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (“limiting factor assays”: LFA) to infer how the limiting factor for microbial growth would be affected by future climate change. We found that bacteria were triple-limited by C, N and P, while fungi were co-limited by C and N, with no shift in the limiting factor for bacterial or fungal growth across the ecotone. However, bacterial responses to the LFA were stronger in the tundra, showing 9-fold stronger increases in response to LFA-CNP addition compared to that in the forest. In contrast, fungal responses to the LFA were stronger in the forest, showing a 120% higher growth in response to LFA-CN addition, with no detectable response to LFA-CN addition in the tundra. These contrasting results suggested competitive interactions for resources between the two decomposer groups. Fertilization in the field shifted the bacterial resource limitation, but had no effect on the limiting factor for fungal growth. Together, our findings suggest that resource limitations for soil microorganisms will not change due to future warming, but rather affect degrees of fungal-to-bacterial dominance. © 2022},

  ABSTRACT = {The relevance of the Arctic regions’ study is rapidly increasing due to the sensitive response of fragile ecosystems to climate change and anthropogenic pressure. The microbiome is an important component that determines the soils’ functioning and an indicator of changes occurring in ecosystems. Rybachy Peninsula is the northernmost part of the continental European Russia and is almost completely surrounded by Barents Sea water. For the first time, the microbial communities of the Entic Podzol, Albic Podzol, Rheic Histosol and Folic Histosol as well as anthropogenically disturbed soils (chemical pollution and human impact, growing crops) on the Rybachy Peninsula were characterized using plating and fluorescence microscopy methods, in parallel with the enzymatic activity of soils. The amount and structure of soil microbial biomass, such as the total biomass of fungi and prokaryote, the length and diameter of fungal and actinomycete mycelium, the proportion of spores and mycelium in the fungal biomass, the number of spores and prokaryotic cells, the proportion of small and large fungal spores and their morphology were determined. In the soils of the peninsula, the fungal biomass varied from 0.121 to 0.669 mg/g soil. The biomass of prokaryotes in soils ranged from 9.22 to 55.45 μg/g of soil. Fungi predominated, the proportion of which in the total microbial biomass varied from 78.5 to 97.7%. The number of culturable microfungi ranged from 0.53 to 13.93 × 103 CFU/g in the topsoil horizons, with a maximum in Entic Podzol and Albic Podzol soils and a minimum in anthropogenically disturbed soil. The number of culturable copiotrophic bacteria varied from 41.8 × 103 cells/g in a cryogenic spot to 5551.3 × 103 cells /g in anthropogenically disturbed soils. The number of culturable oligotrophic bacteria ranged from 77.9 to 12,059.6 × 103 cells/g. Changes in natural soils because of anthropogenic impact and a change in vegetation types have led to a change in the structure of the community of soil microorganisms. Investigated tundra soils had high enzymatic activity in native and anthropogenic conditions. The β-glucosidase and urease activity were comparable or even higher than in the soils of more southern natural zone, and the activity of dehydrogenase was 2–5 times lower. Thus, despite the subarctic climatic conditions, local soils have a significant biological activity upon which the productivity of ecosystems largely depends. The soils of the Rybachy Peninsula have a powerful enzyme pool due to the high adaptive potential of soil microorganisms to the extreme conditions of the Arctic, which allows them to perform their functions even under conditions of anthropogenic interference. © 2023 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Here, we present the results related to a new unique terrestrial ecosystem found in an englacial hypersaline brine found in Northern Victoria Land (Antarctica). Both the geochemistry and microbial (prokaryotic and fungal) diversity revealed an unicity with respect to all the other known Antarctic brines and suggested a probable ancient origin mainly due a progressive cryoconcentration of seawater. The prokaryotic community presented some peculiarities, such as the occurrence of sequences of Patescibacteria (which can thrive in nutrient-limited water environments) or few Spirochaeta, and the presence of archaeal sequences of Methanomicrobia closely related to Methanoculleus, a methanogen commonly detected in marine and estuarine environments. The high percentage (35%) of unassigned fungal taxa suggested the presence of a high degree of undiscovered diversity within a structured fungal community (including both yeast and filamentous life forms) and reinforce the hypothesis of a high degree of biological uniqueness of the habitat under study. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Most of the Antarctic continent and surrounding islands are permanently covered by ice. However, due to long-term natural and short term human-induced climate changes, glaciers in the maritime Antarctic islands are currently retreating, exposing new substrates for colonization by microorganisms and plants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the microbial communities along a transect comprised of soils with different exposition times since the glacier retreat in Barton Peninsula (King George Island). We observed an intense degree of microbial succession in young soils located in the Recently Exposed Area (REA), analogously to a game of ‘musical chairs’ where microbial species rapidly occupy available niches as new environments emerge. In contrast, more developed soils exhibited a less dynamic community turnover. The co-occurrence networks of both bacteria and fungi presented a less modular structure and a higher connectance in the REA, whereas a more modular structure was found in the three networks of the more developed soils. This suggests that these communities are more susceptible to external perturbations and microbial succession. Furthermore, the functional prediction demonstrated that the functional redundancy is lower in the REA than in more developed soils. The surprising high diversity of microbial communities adjacent to the glacier front deserves further studies to compare with different areas (in terms of substrate, climate) under a common present-day warming scenario. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microorganisms dominate marine environments in the polar oceans and are known to harbor greater diversity and abundance than was once thought, and yet, little is known about their biogeographic distribution patterns in marine sediments at a broad spatial scale. In this study, we conducted extensive sampling of marine sediments along a latitudinal transect spanning 2500 km from the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean to investigate the geographical distribution patterns of bacteria, archaea, and fungi. Our findings revealed that the community similarities of bacteria and fungi decay at similar rates with increasing geographical distance (slope: −0.005 and −0.002), which are much lower than the decay rate of archaeal communities (slope: −0.012). Notably, microbial richness and community composition showed significant differences in the region of 75−80°N compared to other regions in 60−75°N. Salinity, temperature, pH, ammonium nitrogen, and total organic carbon are key factors that significantly affect microbial community variations. Furthermore, bacterial co-occurrence networks showed more complex interactions but lower modularity than fungal counterparts. This study provides crucial insights into the spatial distribution patterns of bacteria, archaea, and fungi in the Arctic marine sediments and will be critical for a better understanding of microbial global distribution and ecological functions. © 2025 The Author(s). mLife published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

  ABSTRACT = {Studies on the diversity and catabolic functionality of fungi in Arctic soils are still scarce. This knowledge gap needs to be urgently addressed, as global warming may have unpredictable effects on cold-adapted fungal species. We isolated two yeast species of the family Filobasidiaceae: Goffeauzyma gilvescens and Naganishia albidosimilis, from soil in central Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and characterised their metabolic properties at two temperatures, 4°C and 20°C, in a laboratory test using Biolog® FF plates. The results of the Biolog® test, which followed molecular identification of the strains, confirmed that the two species differed in their functional (catabolic) characteristics. The effect of temperature was also highly significant and the metabolic characteristics of two species varied between the two temperatures tested. As expected, among other chemical guilds of substrates on Biolog® plates, carbohydrates were the most used and also the most segregating of the strains studied, especially at 20°C. However, the relative use of almost all substrate groups changed between the two temperatures for both species tested, indicating that temperature can also affect soil microorganisms indirectly by altering their metabolic pathways. As soil microorganisms form a complex trophic and non-trophic network, such changes in metabolism under increasing temperature may also alter relationships between species and between species and the environment. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the microbial ecology of the unique ecosystem of polar soils. © 2024 Beata Klimek, Przemysław Ryszka, Piotr Zieliński, Federica Carlea, Katarzyna Wojczulanis-Jakubas and Dominika Wloch-Salamon.},

  ABSTRACT = {In recent decades the habitat of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) has expanded from boreal forests into Arctic tundra ecosystems. Beaver ponds in Arctic watersheds are known to alter stream biogeochemistry, which is likely coupled with changes in the activity and composition of microbial communities inhabiting beaver pond sediments. We investigated bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities in beaver pond sediments along tundra streams in northwestern Alaska (AK), USA and compared them to those of tundra lakes and streams in north-central Alaska that are unimpacted by beavers. β-glucosidase activity assays indicated higher cellulose degradation potential in beaver ponds than in unimpacted streams and lakes within a watershed absent of beavers. Beta diversity analyses showed that dominant lineages of bacteria and archaea in beaver ponds differed from those in tundra lakes and streams, but dominant fungal lineages did not differ between these sample types. Beaver pond sediments displayed lower relative abundances of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota archaea and of bacteria from typically anaerobic taxonomic groups, suggesting differences in rates of fermentative organic matter (OM) breakdown, syntrophy, and methane generation. Beaver ponds also displayed low relative abundances of Chytridiomycota (putative non-symbiotic) fungi and high relative abundances of ectomycorrhizal (plant symbionts) Basidiomycota fungi, suggesting differences in the occurrence of plant and fungi mutualistic interactions. Beaver ponds also featured microbes with taxonomic identities typically associated with the cycling of nitrogen and sulfur compounds in higher relative abundances than tundra lakes and streams. These findings help clarify the microbiological implications of beavers expanding into high latitude regions. © 2023. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract: Potential to produce inducible enzymes (several hydrolases and oxidases) and antibiotics as secondary metabolites was studied in soil micromycete strains from the Arctic (Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya) and Antarctica (the oases Thala Hills, Larsemann Hills, Schirmacher, and Marie Byrd Land). Maximal esterase activity was observed in strains of two typical Antarctic species, Hyphozyma variabilis 218 and Thelebolus ellipsoideus 210 (51 and 29 nmol FDA/((g mycelium h), respectively). Cellulolytic activity was maximal (89 µmol glucose/mg biomass) in Ascochyta pisi 192. Extracellular phenol oxidase (laccase) and peroxidase activities were not detected in the strains examined. Antibacterial activity toward Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was observed in 75% of the Antarctic micromycete strains. Higher-activity strains were isolated from organic-rich moist habitats with a moss or lichen cover. Maximal activities were displayed by Paecilomyces marquandii 166, Penicillium janczewskii 165, Penicillium roseopurpureum 169, and Thelebolus ellipsoideus 210. Antagonistic activity toward Antarctic bacterial strains was shown by 77% of the microfungal strains examined. Maximal inhibition was observed with strains of the typical Antarctic species Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus MT303855 and the eurytopic species Sarocladium kiliense MT303856. Antimycotic activity was observed in 42% of the strains. Both activities were detected in 38% of the Antarctic strains. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Climate change is affecting winter snow conditions significantly in northern ecosystems but the effects of the changing conditions for soil microbial communities are not well-understood. We utilized naturally occurring differences in snow accumulation to understand how the wintertime subnivean conditions shape bacterial and fungal communities in dwarf shrub-dominated sub-Arctic Fennoscandian tundra sampled in mid-winter, early, and late growing season. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and quantitative PCR analyses indicated that fungal abundance was higher in windswept tundra heaths with low snow accumulation and lower nutrient availability. This was associated with clear differences in the microbial community structure throughout the season. Members of Clavaria spp. and Sebacinales were especially dominant in the windswept heaths. Bacterial biomass proxies were higher in the snow-accumulating tundra heaths in the late growing season but there were only minor differences in the biomass or community structure in winter. Bacterial communities were dominated by members of Alphaproteobacteria, Actinomycetota, and Acidobacteriota and were less affected by the snow conditions than the fungal communities. The results suggest that small-scale spatial patterns in snow accumulation leading to a mosaic of differing tundra heath vegetation shapes bacterial and fungal communities as well as soil carbon and nutrient availability. © The Author(s) 2024.},

This article provides comprehensive insights into the results and major findings from the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) Project – an Arctic region research program initiated in Japan, which aims to address and advance our understanding of these uncertainties. Marine ecosystem studies have identified several biogeochemical processes that are associated with sea ice decline and northward transport and shift of marine species across multiple trophic levels over the Bering and Chukchi Sea shelves. Studies of the terrestrial ecosystem have identified factors that are important for the understanding of terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems, including Arctic lakes, under the presence of global warming. Novel fungal species from the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem have also been isolated and described.

  ABSTRACT = {Rhizosphere microbial communities exert critical roles in plant health, nutrient cycling, and soil fertility. Despite the essential functions conferred by microbes, the source and acquisition of the rhizosphere are not entirely clear. Therefore, we investigated microbial community diversity and potential source using the only two native Antarctic plants, Deschampsia antarctica (Da) and Colobanthus quitensis (Cq), as models. We interrogated rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes at six locations in the Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica, both individual plant species and their association (Da.Cq). Our results show that host plant species influenced the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Here, the Da rhizosphere showed the lowest richness and diversity of bacteria compared to Cq and Da.Cq rhizospheres. In contrast, for rhizosphere fungal communities, plant species only influenced diversity, whereas the rhizosphere of Da exhibited higher fungal diversity than the Cq rhizosphere. Also, we found that environmental geographic pressures (i.e., sampling site, latitude, and altitude) and, to a lesser extent, biotic factors (i.e., plant species) determined the species turnover between microbial communities. Moreover, our analysis shows that the sources of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere were local soils that contributed to homogenizing the community composition of the different plant species growing in the same sampling site. In contrast, the sources of rhizosphere fungi were local (for Da and Da.Cq) and distant soils (for Cq). Here, the host plant species have a specific effect in acquiring fungal communities to the rhizosphere. However, the contribution of unknown sources to the fungal rhizosphere (especially in Da and Da.Cq) indicates the existence of relevant stochastic processes in acquiring these microbes. Our study shows that rhizosphere microbial communities differ in their composition and diversity. These differences are explained mainly by the microbial composition of the soils that harbor them, acting together with plant species-specific effects. Both plant species acquire bacteria from local soils to form part of their rhizosphere. Seemingly, the acquisition process is more complex for fungi. We identified a significant contribution from unknown fungal sources due to stochastic processes and known sources from soils across the Byers Peninsula.

  ABSTRACT = {In Victoria Land, Antarctica, ice-free areas are restricted to coastal regions and dominate the landscape of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. These two environments are subjected to different pressures that determine the establishment of highly adapted fungal communities. Within the kingdom of fungi, filamentous, yeasts and meristematic/microcolonial growth forms on one side and different lifestyles on the other side may be considered adaptive strategies of particular interest in the frame of Antarctic constraints. In this optic, soil fungal communities from both coastal and Dry Valleys sites, already characterized thorough ITS1 metabarcoding sequencing, have been compared to determine the different distribution of phyla, growth forms, and lifestyles. Though we did not find significant differences in the richness between the two environments, the communities were highly differentiated and Dry Valleys sites had a higher evenness compared to coastal ones. Additionally, the distribution of different growth forms and lifestyles were well differentiated, and their diversity and composition were likely influenced by soil abiotic parameters, among which soil granulometry, pH, P, and C contents were the potential main determinants. © 2021 by the authors.

  ABSTRACT = {Although microorganisms are the very first colonizers of recently deglaciated soils even prior to plant colonization, the drivers and patterns of microbial community succession at early-successional stages remain poorly understood. The successional dynamics and assembly processes of bacterial and fungal communities were compared on a glacier foreland in the maritime Antarctic across the ~10-year soil-age gradient from bare soil to sparsely vegetated area. Bacterial communities shifted more rapidly than fungal communities in response to glacial retreat; species turnover (primarily the transition from glacier- to soil-favouring taxa) contributed greatly to bacterial beta diversity, but this pattern was less clear in fungi. Bacterial communities underwent more predictable (more deterministic) changes along the soil-age gradient, with compositional changes paralleling the direction of changes in soil physicochemical properties following deglaciation. In contrast, the compositional shift in fungal communities was less associated with changes in deglaciation-induced changes in soil geochemistry and most fungal taxa displayed mosaic abundance distribution across the landscape, suggesting that the successional dynamics of fungal communities are largely governed by stochastic processes. A co-occurrence network analysis revealed that biotic interactions between bacteria and fungi are very weak in early succession. Taken together, these results collectively suggest that bacterial and fungal communities in recently deglaciated soils are largely decoupled from each other during succession and exert very divergent trajectories of succession and assembly under different selective forces. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

  ABSTRACT = {Lichens are present in most terrestrial ecosystems on Earth and colonize extreme habitats, where vascular plants are unable to thrive, due to unique properties of the fungal-algal symbiosis. Here, we explored the phylogeographic structure of green algae engaged in symbiosis with species in the genus Pseudephebe (Parmeliaceae). These often form deep brown to blackish fruticose thalli on acidic rocks, and have partially overlapping distributions: P. minuscula is bipolar and co-occurs with P. pubescens in Europe. Based on a broad sampling, including the Arctic and Antarctica, we focused on photobionts (1) to identify genetic lineages and their phylogenetic assignment, (2) to infer the haplotype distribution in relation with geography and the mycobiont’s identity, and (3) to evaluate spatial genetic structure and polymorphism. Results revealed three Trebouxia clade S lineages (Trebouxia S02, T. suecica and T. angustilobata) associated to Pseudephebe species, with predominant haplotypes distributed throughout the entire geographic distribution, and some, less frequent, shared between widely distant localities. Photobiont switching was evident in the Mediterranean region, and algal co-occurrence was frequent in both mycobionts, which shared the same set of photobionts; this could explain, at least partially, their overlapping distribution. Furthermore, genetic structure was influenced by geography given the substantial percentages of genetic variation (ca. 25–50%) explained by the different delimited eco−/biogeographic regions. In Continental Antarctica, mycobionts showed a high specialization towards the photobionts, which are probably endemic of this climatically extreme region. Taken together, our findings provide further insight about the processes shaping lichen biogeography. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

  ABSTRACT = {Global warming is most pronounced in the Arctic region. Greenhouse gas (GHG) release from Arctic soils increase due to global warming. By this, the Arctic may change from currently being a carbon sink to a future source. To improve accurate predictions of future GHG release from Arctic soils, it is important to unravel factors controlling both the microbial community structure and activity. Soil microbial activity is important for Arctic greenhouse gas production, but depends on soil conditions such as salinity being increased by calcium (Ca) and decreased by amorphous silica (Si) potentially enhancing water availability. In the Arctic, climate changes may alter salinity by changing Si and Ca concentrations upon permafrost thaw as a result of global warming with Si potentially decreasing and Ca potentially increasing salinity. Here, we show that higher Si concentration increased and higher Ca concentrations decreased the microbial CO2 production for both a salt-poor and a salt-rich soil from Greenland. In the salt-rich soil, Si amendment increased CO2 production and the abundance of gram-negative bacteria. However, the bacterial community became dominated by spore-forming gram-positive Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The CO2 release from soils was directly affected by the abundance of bacteria and fungi, and their community structure. Our results highlight the importance of the soil Si and Ca concentration on organic carbon turnover by strongly changing microbial abundance and community structure, with consequences for CO2 release in the Arctic. Consequently, Ca and Si and their relation to Arctic soil microbial community structure has to be considered when estimating pan-Arctic carbon budgets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mycothalli, symbioses between liverworts and soil fungi, have not previously been recorded in the Arctic. Here, 13 species of leafy liverwort from west Spitsbergen in the High Arctic are examined for the symbiosis using epifluores-cence microscopy and sequencing of fungal ribosomal (r)RNA genes amplified from plant tissues. Microscopy showed that intracellular hyphal coils, key indi-cators of the symbiosis, were frequent (>40% stem length colonized) in nine species of liverwort in the families Anastrophyllaceae, Lophoziaceae, Cephaloziellaceae, Cephaloziaceae and Scapaniaceae, with hyphae occurring frequently (>40% cells occupied) in the rhizoids of 10 species in the same fam-ilies. Dark septate hyphae, apparently formed by ascomycetes, were frequent on the stems of members of the Anastrophyllaceae, Cephaloziellaceae and Cephaloziaceae, and typically those growing on acidic mine tailings. Sequencing of fungal rRNA genes showed the presence of nine distinct groups (based on a 3% cut-off for ITS sequence divergence) of the basidiomycete Serendipita in the Anastrophyllaceae and Lophoziaceae, with ordinations and correlative analyses showing the presence of the genus to be positively associated with the frequency of hyphal coils, the occurrence of which was positively associated with edaphic factors (soil δ15N value and concentrations of moisture, nitrogen, car-bon and organic matter). We propose that the frequency of mycothalli in leafy liverworts on west Spitsbergen, which is an order of magnitude higher than at lower latitudes, may arise from benefits conferred by mycobionts on their hosts in the harsh environment of the High Arctic.

  ABSTRACT = {Rock-dwelling fungi play critical ecological roles in drylands, including soil formation and nutrient cycling; however, we know very little about the identity, function and environmental preferences of these important organisms, and the mere existence of a consistent rock mycobiome across diverse arid regions of the planet remains undetermined. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of rock fungi and spatially associated soil communities, surveyed across 28 unique sites spanning four major biogeographic regions (North America, Arctic, Maritime and Continental Antarctica) including contrasting climates, from cold and hot deserts to semiarid drylands. We show that rocks support a consistent and unique mycobiome that was different from that found in surrounding soils. Lichenized fungi from class Lecanoromycetes were consistently indicative of rocks across contrasting regions, together with ascomycetous representatives of black fungi in Arthoniomycetes, Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes. In addition, compared with soil, rocks had a lower proportion of saprobes and plant symbiotic fungi. The main drivers structuring rock fungi distribution were spatial distance and, to a larger extent, climatic factors regulating moisture and temperature (i.e. mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation), suggesting that these paramount and unique communities might be particularly sensitive to increases in temperature and desertification. © 2022 The Author(s).

  ABSTRACT = {Climatically extreme regions such as the polar deserts of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (78° S) in Continental Antarctica are key areas for a better understanding of changes in ecosystems. Therefore, it is particularly important to analyze and communicate current patterns of biodiversity in these sensitive areas, where precipitation mostly occurs in form of snow and liquid water is rare. Humidity provided by dew, clouds, and fog are the main water sources, especially for rock-dwelling crustose lichens as one of the most common vegetation-forming organisms. We investigated the diversity and interaction specificity of myco-/photobiont associations of 232 crustose lichen specimens, collected along an elevational gradient (171–959 m a.s.l.) within the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The mycobiont species and photobiont OTUs were identified by using three markers each (nrITS, mtSSU, RPB1, and nrITS, psbJ-L, COX2). Elevation, positively associated with water availability, turned out to be the key factor explaining most of the distribution patterns of the mycobionts. Pairwise comparisons showed Lecidea cancriformis and Rhizoplaca macleanii to be significantly more common at higher elevations and Carbonea vorticosa and Lecidea polypycnidophora at lower elevations. Lichen photobionts were dominated by the globally distributed Trebouxia OTU, Tr_A02 which occurred at all habitats. Network specialization resulting from myco-/photobiont bipartite network structure varied with elevation and associated abiotic factors. Along an elevational gradient, the spatial distribution, diversity, and genetic variability of the lichen symbionts appear to be mainly influenced by improved water relations at higher altitudes. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Invasive plants may displace native species. This is the case for Poa annua, the only non-native plant species successfully established in Maritime Antarctica. Nonetheless, it is uncertain which factors drive the competitive success of P. annua in the harsh environmental conditions of the region. The ability of this plant species to establish novel mutualistic interactions with resident soil fungi may be crucial for its invasiveness. Such ability may be linked to the vertical transmission of fungal endophytes via seeds. Aims: We undertook a study to assess the role of seed fungal endophytes as promoters of the establishment and invasion of Poa annua in Maritime Antarctica. Methods: We explored the composition and diversity of fungal communities associated with different P. annua tissues (seeds, leaves and roots) and the soil. We also measured parameters including germination rate, above-ground biomass, reproductive structures, and the survival of invasive P. annua as well as of the native Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica grown from seeds with and without endophytes. Furthermore, we conducted inter- and intraspecific competition experiments among native and invasive plants, where chemically mediated plant-to-plant interference (allelopathy) and plant growth rate were measured to calculate a relative competition index. Results: We found that fungal endophyte taxa associated with P. annua tissues were very different from those in the soil. Fungal endophytes in P. annua differed among seed, root and shoot tissues, which suggests low transmission among different organs. The removal of endophytes from P. annua seeds was associated with reduced seed germination, plant growth and survivorship, while the competitive ability of P. annua (assessed by accumulated biomass) relative to native species, as well as levels of allelochemicals in soils, were higher in the presence of seed fungal endophytes. Conclusion: Our results suggest that fungal endophytes, maternally inherited through seeds, improve host fitness and may contribute to the invasive success of P. annua in Antarctica. © 2022 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microbes are widely assumed to be capable of colonizing even the most challenging terrestrial surface environments on Earth given enough time. We would not expect to find surface soils uninhabited by microbes as soils typically harbor diverse microbial communities and viable microbes have been detected in soils exposed to even the most inhospitable conditions. However, if uninhabited soils do exist, we might expect to find them in Antarctica. We analyzed 204 ice-free soils collected from across a remote valley in the Transantarctic Mountains (84–85°S, 174–177°W) and were able to identify a potential limit of microbial habitability. While most of the soils we tested contained diverse microbial communities, with fungi being particularly ubiquitous, microbes could not be detected in many of the driest, higher elevation soils—results that were confirmed using cultivation-dependent, cultivation-independent, and metabolic assays. While we cannot confirm that this subset of soils is completely sterile and devoid of microbial life, our results suggest that microbial life is severely restricted in the coldest, driest, and saltiest Antarctic soils. Constant exposure to these conditions for thousands of years has limited microbial communities so that their presence and activity is below detectable limits using a variety of standard methods. Such soils are unlikely to be unique to the studied region with this work supporting previous hypotheses that microbial habitability is constrained by near-continuous exposure to cold, dry, and salty conditions, establishing the environmental conditions that limit microbial life in terrestrial surface soils. © 2021.

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding microbial niche variability in polar regions can provide insights into the adaptive diversification of microbial lineages in extreme environments. Compositions of microbial communities in Arctic soils are well documented but a comprehensive multidomain diversity assessment of rocks remains insufficiently studied. In this study, we obtained two types of rocks (sandstone and limestone) and soils around the rocks in a high Arctic polar desert (Svalbard), and examined the compositions of archaeal, bacterial, fungal, and protistan communities in the rocks and soils. The microbial community structure differed significantly between rocks and soils across all microbial groups at higher taxonomic levels, indicating that Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Latescibacteria, Rokubacteria, Leotiomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Mortierellomycetes, Sarcomonadea, and Spirotrichea were more abundant in soils, whereas Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, FBP, Lecanoromycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Trebouxiophyceae, and Ulvophyceae were more abundant in rocks. Interestingly, fungal communities differed markedly between two different rock types, which is likely to be ascribed to the predominance of distinct lichen-forming fungal taxa (Verrucariales in limestone, and Lecanorales in sandstone). This suggests that the physical or chemical properties of rocks could be a major determinant in the successful establishment of lichens in lithic environments. Furthermore, the biotic interactions among microorganisms based on co-occurrence network analysis revealed that Polyblastia and Verrucaria in limestone, and Atla, Porpidia, and Candelariella in sandstone play an important role as keystone taxa in the lithic communities. Our study shows that even in niches with the same climate regime and proximity to each other, heterogeneity of edaphic and lithic niches can affect microbial community assembly, which could be helpful in comprehensively understanding the effects of niche on microbial assembly in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. © Copyright © 2021 Choe, Kim and Lee.},

  ABSTRACT = {Microbial symbionts are essential for plant niche expansion into novel habitats. Dormant propagules of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are thought to play an important role in seedling establishment in invasion fronts; however, propagule bank communities above the treeline are poorly understood in the Eurasian Arctic, where treelines are expected to advance under rapid climate change. To investigate the availability of EM fungal propagules, we collected 100 soil samples from Arctic tundra sites and applied bioassay experiments using Larix cajanderi as bait seedlings. We detected 11 EM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by obtaining entire ITS regions. Suillus clintonianus was the most frequently observed OTU, followed by Cenococcum geophilum and Sebacinales OTU1. Three Suillus and one Rhizopogon species were detected in the bioassay seedlings, indicating the availability of Larix-specific suilloid spores at least 30 km from the contemporary treeline. Spores of S. clintonianus and S. spectabilis remained infective after preservation for 14 mo and heat treatment at 60°C, implying the durability of the spores. Long-distance dispersal capability and spore resistance to adverse conditions may represent ecological strategies employed by suilloid fungi to quickly associate with emerging seedlings of compatible hosts in treeless habitats. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract: The study of microbial complexes in organo-accumulative horizons of Antarctic soils (Cryosols, Leptosols) at the Larsemann Hills and Schirmacher oases and on King George Island has been carried out by the fouling glass method. This method allows one to study the taxonomic composition of microorganisms, features of their morphology, inter-organism interactions, and spatial organization of the complex of microorganisms, as well as to simulate the processes of colonization of mineral surfaces. The investigated microbial complexes can be subdivided into four groups with respect to dominant microorganisms: (1) diverse microbial complexes of King George Island with a considerable portion of diatoms among algae and with a predominance of mycelium in the fungal biomass; (2) complexes of lichen–moss, moss, and algal–moss associations in lake basins with a greater proportion of eukaryotic and coccoid cyanobacteria and with mycelium and sporous forms of micromycetes; (3) complexes of moss and algal–moss associations in the bottoms of wet valleys with a higher proportion of filamentous cyanobacteria and with the absence of fungi, or their presence in the form of short chains of chlamydospores; and (4) hypolithic microbial complexes of rock baths in dry rocky habitats, where the fouling of glasses did not take place. The microbial complexes in different glass samples taken in February–March in different years proved to be at different stages of development. Microscopic mycelium of fungi was not abundant in all algae and moss associations; in some, it was practically absent. Among algae, not cyanobacteria, but eukaryotic algae dominated in a number of habitats: diatoms, green algae, and streptophytes. The totality of the complex features indicated the extremity of the habitat: one morphotype of melanized fungal mycelium dominated in a particular sample; there was no diversity of spore forms, which indirectly indicates a low taxonomic diversity of fungi; multiple chlamydospore formation and microcycles of development were common. Among cyanobacteria, brown and reddish coloration was often found, and the formation of biofilms on glasses was limited to microcolonies, while algal biofilms abundantly covered the soil of the studied horizons. Apparently, extended biofilms were formed over time exceeding the exposure time of the glasses. Hypolithic communities did not colonize new habitats (glasses) for several years of exposure, unlike the bottoms of hydromorphic valleys and lake basins in oases (glasses overgrown in a year) and King George Island (glasses overgrown in 10 days). © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Terrestrial ecosystems in the maritime Antarctic experienced rapid warming during the latter half of the 20               th               century. While warming ceased at the turn of the millennium, significant increases in air temperature are expected later this century, with predicted positive effects on soil fungal diversity, plant growth and ecosystem productivity. Here, by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA genes in 40 soils sampled from along a 1,650 km climatic gradient through the maritime Antarctic, we determine whether rising air temperatures might similarly influence the diversity of soil bacteria. Of 22 environmental factors, mean annual surface air temperature was the strongest and most consistent predictor of soil bacterial diversity. Significant, but weaker, associations between bacterial diversity and soil moisture content, C:N ratio, and Ca, Mg, PO               4               3−               and dissolved organic C concentrations were also detected. These findings indicate that further rises in air temperature in the maritime Antarctic may enhance terrestrial ecosystem productivity through positive effects on soil bacterial diversity.             © 2019, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Although the maritime Antarctic has undergone rapid warming, the effects on indigenous soil-inhabiting microorganisms are not well known. Passive warming experiments using open-top chamber (OTC) have been performed on the Fildes Peninsula in the maritime Antarctic since 2008. When the soil temperature was measured at a depth of 2–5 cm during the 2013–2015 summer seasons, the mean temperature inside OTC (OTC-In) increased by approximately 0.8 °C compared with outside OTC (OTC-Out), while soil chemical and physical characteristics did not change. Soils (2015 summer) from OTC-In and OTC-Out were subjected to analysis for change in microbial community and degradation rate of humic substances (HS, the largest pool of recalcitrant organic carbon in soil). Archaeal and bacterial communities in OTC-In were minimally affected by warming compared with those in OTC-Out, with archaeal methanogenic Thermoplasmata slightly increased in abundance. The abundance of heterotrophic fungi Ascomycota was significantly altered in OTC-In. Total bacterial and fungal biomass in OTC-In increased by 20% compared to OTC-Out, indicating that this may be due to increased microbial degradation activity for soil organic matter (SOM) including HS, which would result in the release of more low-molecular-weight growth substrates from SOM. Despite the effects of warming on the microbial community over the 8-years-experiments warming did not induce any detectable change in content or structure of polymeric HS. These results suggest that increased temperature may have significant and direct effects on soil microbial communities inhabiting maritime Antarctic and that soil microbes would subsequently provide more available carbon sources for other indigenous microbes. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  ABSTRACT = {As Arctic soils warm, thawed permafrost releases nitrogen (N) that could stimulate plant productivity and thus offset soil carbon losses from tundra ecosystems. Although mycorrhizal fungi could facilitate plant access to permafrost-derived N, their exploration capacity beyond host plant root systems into deep, cold active layer soils adjacent to the permafrost table is unknown. We characterized root-associated fungi (RAF) that colonized ericoid (ERM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) shrub roots and occurred below the maximum rooting depth in permafrost thaw-front soil in tussock and shrub tundra communities. We explored the relationships between root and thaw front fungal composition and plant uptake of a 15N tracer applied at the permafrost boundary. We show that ERM and ECM shrubs associate with RAF at the thaw front providing evidence for potential mycelial connectivity between roots and the permafrost boundary. Among shrubs and tundra communities, RAF connectivity to the thaw boundary was ubiquitous. The occurrence of particular RAF in both roots and thaw front soil was positively correlated with 15N recovered in shrub biomass Taxon-specific RAF associations could be a mechanism for the vertical redistribution of deep, permafrost-derived nutrients, which may alleviate N limitation and stimulate productivity in warming tundra. © 2019 The Authors.

  ABSTRACT = {Climate warming in the Arctic and the thawing of frozen carbon stocks are leading to uncertainty as to how bacterial communities will respond, including pollutant degrading bacteria. This study investigated the effects of carbon stimulation and temperature on soil microbial community diversity and explosive biodegradation in two sub-Arctic soils. Chitin as a labile carbon source stimulated overall microbial activities as reflected by increases in basal respiration (three to tenfold) and potential nitrification activity (two to fourfold) compared to unamended soil. This stimulation extended to 2,4-dinitroluene- (DNT) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)-degrading microorganisms either directly or via co-metabolic reaction mechanisms. A stimulatory effect of the incubation temperature (2, 12, or 22 °C) on these microbial activities was also observed, but the chitin stimulation caused greater shifts in the structure of the bacterial and fungal communities. The first reported occurrence of an associated role of chitinolytic bacteria belonging to Cellulomonadaceae and chitinolytic fungi belonging to Mortierellaceae in explosive biodegradation is described. This study found that sub-Arctic soil microbial communities were adapted to respond quickly to an increase in labile carbon sources over the range of temperatures used in this study. The warming climate in the Arctic could benefit explosive contaminated soil clean-up by providing non-recalcitrant carbon sources that stimulate overall microbial activity and correspondingly explosive biodegradation. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract: The Progress Station is the largest Russian Antarctic station. The anthropogenic impact on primary soils in the area of this station is reflected in the chemical structure of soils and structure of microbial communities. The article shows a multiple increase in the number of microorganisms (especially microscopic fungi) in contaminated soils around the Progress Station. The anthropogenic impact changes the structure of complexes of soil microorganisms. The proportion of mesophilic microorganisms significantly increases under these conditions. Fifty-three micromycete species of 28 genera have been identified in samples of primary soils and anthropogenic substrates. Their diversity decreases from the anthropogenic soils and anthropogenic substrates to the control (“clean”) soils. It is shown that an increase in the number of micromycete species in the area of the polar station results from the invasion of new micromycete species due to human activities. Some native species of micromycetes can adapt to anthropogenic substrates and can be destructors of different introduced materials. Over 56 and 70% among micromycetes from the contaminated soils and anthropogenic substrates, respectively, can be considered potentially pathogenic species. Therefore, invasive processes change the structure of complexes of soil micromycetes, which can serve as an indicator of anthropogenic impact on ecosystems in the Larsemann Hills oasis in East Antarctica. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ongoing climate change involves increasing snow scarcity, which results in more frequent freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in polar and alpine soils. Although repeated FTCs have been shown to alter the structure and functions of soil microbial communities, a thorough understanding on the influence of FTCs frequency on polar and especially alpine soil microbiomes is still elusive. Here, we investigated the impact of repeated weekly vs. daily FTC frequencies on the structure and functions of prokaryotic and fungal communities from north- and south-exposed soils from two mountain ridges, one in the Arctic and one in the High-Alps. FTCs affected prokaryotic communities more strongly than fungal communities, where mainly cold-tolerant and opportunistic fungi (e.g., Mrakia, Mortierella) were responsive. Prokaryotic communities were more affected by weekly FTCs than by daily FTCs. Daily FTCs favored fast-growing bacteria (e.g., Arthrobacter), while oligotrophic and largely uncultured taxa (e.g., Verrucomicrobia) benefited from weekly FTCs. FTCs negatively affected microbial respiration but had minor impacts on C-, N- and P-acquiring enzymatic activities. Plausible pre-adaptation of the microbial communities to naturally occurring frequent FTCs at their site of origin did not show a clear influence on the microbial responses to the tested FTCs. Altogether, our study provides an integrative overview on potential structural and functional changes of soil microbial communities in polar and alpine regions in response to the projected increase in FTCs; therefore advancing our understanding on the impact of climate change in these rapidly changing ecosystems. © Copyright © 2020 Perez-Mon, Frey and Frossard.},

  ABSTRACT = {Glacier forefields provide a unique chronosequence to assess microbial or plant colonization and ecological succession on previously uncolonized substrates. Patterns of microbial succession in soils of alpine and subpolar glacier forefields are well documented but those affecting high polar systems, including moraine rocks, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we examine succession patterns in pioneering bacterial, fungal and algal communities developing on moraine rocks and soil at the Hurd Glacier forefield (Livingston Island, Antarctica). Over time, changes were produced in the microbial community structure of rocks and soils (ice-free for different lengths of time), which differed between both substrates across the entire chronosequence, especially for bacteria and fungi. In addition, fungal and bacterial communities showed more compositional consistency in soils than rocks, suggesting community assembly in each niche could be controlled by processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales. Microscopy revealed a patchy distribution of epilithic and endolithic lithobionts, and increasing endolithic colonization and microbial community complexity along the chronosequence. We conclude that, within relatively short time intervals, primary succession processes at polar latitudes involve significant and distinct changes in edaphic and lithic microbial communities associated with soil development and cryptogamic colonization. © Copyright © 2020 Garrido-Benavent, Pérez-Ortega, Durán, Ascaso, Pointing, Rodríguez-Cielos, Navarro and de los Ríos.},

  ABSTRACT = {Although research on microbial biogeography has made great progress in the past decade, distributions of terrestrial microbial communities in extreme environments such as Antarctica are not well understood. In addition, knowledge of whether and how historical contingencies affect microbial distributions at small spatial scales is lacking. Here, we analyzed soil-borne microbial (bacterial, archaeal, and fungal) communities in 12 quadrat plots around the Fildes Region of King George Island, maritime Antarctica, and the communities were divided into two groups according to the soil elemental compositions and environmental attributes of Holocene raised beach and Tertiary volcanic stratigraphy. Prokaryotic communities of the two groups were well separated; the prokaryotic data were primarily correlated with soil elemental compositions and were secondly correlated with environmental attributes (e.g., soil pH, total organic carbon, NO3-, and vegetation coverage; Pearson test, r = 0.59 vs. 0.52, both P < 0.01). The relatively high abundance of P, S, Cl, and Br in Group 1 (Holocene raised beach site) was likely due to landform uplift. Lithophile-elements (Si, Al, Ca, Sr, Ti, V, and Fe) correlated with prokaryotic communities in Group 2 may have originated from weathering of Tertiary volcanic rock. No significant correlations were found between the fungal community distribution and both the soil elemental composition and environmental attributes in this study; however, Monte Carlo tests revealed that elements Sr and Ti, soil pH, sampling altitude, and moss and lichen species numbers had significant impacts on fungal communities. The elements and nutrients accumulated during the formation of different landforms influenced the development of soils, plant growth, and microbial communities, and this resulted in small-scale spatially heterogeneous biological distributions. These findings provide new evidence that geological evolutionary processes in the Fildes Region were crucial to its microbial community development, and the results highlight that microbial distribution patterns are the legacies of historical events at this small spatial scale. Based on this study, the ice-free regions in maritime Antarctica represent suitable research sites for studying the influence of geomorphological features on microbial distributions, and we envision the possibility of a site-specific landform assignment through the analysis of the soil prokaryotic community structure. © Copyright © 2018 Zhang, Lu, Chang, Jiang, Gao, Yao, Li, Cao, Zhou and Peng.},

  ABSTRACT = {A preliminary screening to determine the production of bioactive compounds to control plant pathogenic fungi that belong to the genera Alternaria, Botrytis, Fusarium and Phoma was examined for eight actinomycete strains isolated from Andean and Antarctic soils. Phylogenetic analyses of partial sequences of the 16S rDNA gene showed that five strains were closely related to Streptomyces fildesensis GW25-5T, two to Streptomyces griseus ISP 5236T and one to Streptomyces olivochromogenes DSM 40451T. Only one actinomycete strain could inhibit the growth of all four pathogens while the rest had different degrees of control. The best results were obtained for the plant pathogens Alternaria and Phoma since all the actinomycetes could stop their growth. For Fusarium, only the S. griseus strains were able to show efficiency in controlling it. This study shows that actinomycetes are a prolific source of bioactive compounds. © 2018 Chiriotti Editori.

  ABSTRACT = {Different organic compounds have distinct residence times in soil and are degraded by specific taxa of saprotrophic fungi. It hence follows that specific fungal taxa should respire carbon of different ages from these compounds to the atmosphere. Here, we test whether this is the case by radiocarbon (14C) dating CO2 evolved from two gamma radiation-sterilised maritime Antarctic soils inoculated with pure single cultures of four fungi. We show that a member of the Helotiales, which accounted for 41-56% of all fungal sequences in the two soils, respired soil carbon that was aged up to 1,200 years BP and which was 350-400 years older than that respired by the other three taxa. Analyses of the enzyme profile of the Helotialean fungus and the fluxes and δ13C values of CO2 that it evolved suggested that its release of old carbon from soil was associated with efficient cellulose decomposition. Our findings support suggestions that increases in the ages of carbon respired from warmed soils may be caused by changes to the abundances or activities of discrete taxa of microbes, and indicate that the loss of old carbon from soils is driven by specific fungal taxa. © 2018 The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent molecular evidence suggests a global distribution of marine fungi; however, the ecological relevance and corresponding biological contributions of fungi to marine ecosystems remains largely unknown. We assessed fungal biomass from the open Arctic Ocean by applying novel biomass conversion factors from cultured isolates to environmental sterol and CARD-FISH data. We found an average of 16.54 nmol m−3 of ergosterol in sea ice and seawater, which corresponds to 1.74 mg C m−3 (444.56 mg C m−2 in seawater). Using Chytridiomycota-specific probes, we observed free-living and particulate-attached cells that averaged 34.07 µg C m−3 in sea ice and seawater (11.66 mg C m−2 in seawater). Summed CARD-FISH and ergosterol values approximate 1.77 mg C m−3 in sea ice and seawater (456.23 mg C m−2 in seawater), which is similar to biomass estimates of other marine taxa generally considered integral to marine food webs and ecosystem processes. Using the GeoChip microarray, we detected evidence for fungal viruses within the Partitiviridae in sediment, as well as fungal genes involved in the degradation of biomass and the assimilation of nitrate. To bridge our observations of fungi on particulate and the detection of degradative genes, we germinated fungal conidia in zooplankton fecal pellets and germinated fungal conidia after 8 months incubation in sterile seawater. Ultimately, these data suggest that fungi could be as important in oceanic ecosystems as they are in freshwater environments. © 2019, International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctic environments are characterized by polar climate, making it difficult for the development of any form of life. The biogeochemical cycles and food web in such restrictive environments may be exclusively formed by microorganisms. Polar mycological studies are recent and there is much to know about the diversity and genetic resources of these microorganisms. In this sense, the molecular taxonomic approach was applied to identify 129 fungal isolates from marine and terrestrial samples collected from the King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctic). Additionally, the production of cold-adapted enzymes by these microorganisms was evaluated. Among the 129 isolates, 69.0% were identified by ITS-sequencing and affiliated into 12 genera. Cadophora, Geomyces, Penicillium, Cosmospora, and Cladosporium were the most abundant genera. Representatives of Cosmospora were isolated only from terrestrial samples, while representatives of the others genera were recovered from marine and terrestrial samples. A total of 29, 19, and 74 isolates were able to produce ligninolytic enzymes, xylanase, and l-asparaginase, respectively. Representatives of Cadophora showed great ability to produce lignin peroxidase (LiP) and laccase at 15.0 °C in liquid medium, while representatives of Penicillium and non-identified fungi were the best producers of xylanase and l-asparaginase at 20.0 °C. The high number of fungi able to produce enzymes at moderate temperature reveals their potential for industrial production and biotechnological applications. The present study broadens the knowledge of fungal diversity associated with the southern polar region. Additionally, data from molecular taxonomy suggest that two filamentous fungi may be considered as potential new species. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {Thawing of permafrost soils is expected to stimulate microbial decomposition and respiration of sequestered carbon. This could, in turn, increase atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide and methane, and create a positive feedback to climate warming. Recent metagenomic studies suggest that permafrost has a large metabolic potential for carbon processing, including pathways for fermentation and methanogenesis. Here, we performed a pilot study using ultrahigh throughput Illumina HiSeq sequencing of reverse transcribed messenger RNA to obtain a detailed overview of active metabolic pathways and responsible organisms in up to 70 cm deep permafrost soils at a moist acidic tundra location in Arctic Alaska. The transcriptional response of the permafrost microbial community was compared before and after 11 days of thaw. In general, the transcriptional profile under frozen conditions suggests a dominance of stress responses, survival strategies, and maintenance processes, whereas upon thaw a rapid enzymatic response to decomposing soil organic matter (SOM) was observed. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, ascomycete fungi, and methanogens were responsible for largest transcriptional response upon thaw. Transcripts indicative of heterotrophic methanogenic pathways utilizing acetate, methanol, and methylamine were found predominantly in the permafrost table after thaw. Furthermore, transcripts involved in acetogenesis were expressed exclusively after thaw suggesting that acetogenic bacteria are a potential source of acetate for acetoclastic methanogenesis in freshly thawed permafrost. Metatranscriptomics is shown here to be a useful approach for inferring the activity of permafrost microbes that has potential to improve our understanding of permafrost SOM bioavailability and biogeochemical mechanisms contributing to greenhouse gas emissions as a result of permafrost thaw. © 2015 Coolen and Orsi.},

  ABSTRACT = {The so far coldest location for flowering plant life was found at 4,505 m asl at the Dom summit in Valais (Switzerland). On an ice-free crest, Saxifraga oppositifolia, a typical arctic-alpine arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plant forms several cushions. Here, we report on a surprisingly diverse fungal community of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal species at this particular location. A few grams of fine sand and organic material obtained from the rhizospheric lithic ‘soil’ and fine roots of S. oppositifolia were examined for fungal spores and hyphae. We found five different species of AM fungi (Glomeromycota) that belonged to all three glomeromycotan classes, to four orders and five different families. We also found hyphae of dark-septate endophytes (unidentified on the species and genus level, members of Vibrisseaceae, Helotiales, Ascomycota) and a few cleistothecia of a putative fungal leaf pathogen resembling Podosphaera alpina (Erysiphaceae, Erysiphales, Ascomycota), which is known to cause powdery mildew on S. oppositifolia. Given the size of the cushions and their annual growth, these microcosms of life may not be older than 30 years, obviously sufficient time to establish a rich fungal community despite the extreme cold at this location, which in terms of higher level mycorrhizal fungal taxa is obviously comparable with fungal communities of well-established alpine, mountainous and even temperate lowland grasslands. © 2014, Swiss Botanical Society.},

  ABSTRACT = {Extremely acidic soils (pH < 3) harbour poorly diversified mycobiota that are very different from less acidic habitats. During investigations of the mycobiota from several highly acidic soils in the Czech Republic and a coastal site in the Antarctic Peninsula, a group of hyaline fungal isolates was obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS region, SSU, LSU), the isolates belonged to three phylogenetic lineages within two different classes, Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes (Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). The first lineage is described here as a new genus and species Acidothrix acidophila gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Amplistromataceae, Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota). The most closely related species to this new clade are wood-inhabiting fungi. The isolates belonging to the second and the third lineages are also described as two new genera and species Acidea extrema gen. nov. et sp. nov. and Soosiella minima gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Helotiales, Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota). Their position and the relationships within Helotiales are discussed. Soosiella minima was acidotolerant, Acidothrix acidophila and Acidea extrema exhibited both acidotolerant and acidophilic characteristics. All the species were slightly halophilic. The adaptation of hyaline fungi from mesophilic lineages to highly acidic environments has been revealed. The association between highly acidic and Antarctic habitats is discussed. © 2014 German Mycological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  ABSTRACT = {Changing climate is expected to alter precipitation patterns in the Arctic, with consequences for subsurface temperature and moisture conditions, community structure, and nutrient mobilization through microbial belowground processes. Here, we address the effect of increased snow depth on the variation in species richness and community structure of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi. Soil samples were collected weekly from mid-July to mid-September in both control and deep snow plots. Richness of ECM fungi was lower, while saprotrophic fungi was higher in increased snow depth plots relative to controls. [Correction added on 23 September 2016 after first online publication: In the preceding sentence, the richness of ECM and saprotrophic fungi were wrongly interchanged and have been fixed in this current version.] ECM fungal richness was related to soil NO3-N, NH4-N, and K; and saprotrophic fungi to NO3-N and pH. Small but significant changes in the composition of saprotrophic fungi could be attributed to snow treatment and sampling time, but not so for the ECM fungi. Delayed snow melt did not influence the temporal variation in fungal communities between the treatments. Results suggest that some fungal species are favored, while others are disfavored resulting in their local extinction due to long-term changes in snow amount. Shifts in species composition of fungal functional groups are likely to affect nutrient cycling, ecosystem respiration, and stored permafrost carbon. © 2016 The Authors.

  ABSTRACT = {Previous studies of fungi in polar environments have revealed a prevalence of basidiomycetous yeasts in soil and in subglacial environments of polythermal glaciers. Ascomycetous yeasts have rarely been reported from extremely cold natural environments, even though they are known contaminants of frozen foods. Using media with low water activity, we have isolated various yeast species from the subglacial ice of four glaciers from the coastal Arctic environment of Kongsfjorden, Spitzbergen, including Debaryomyces hansenii and Pichia guillermondii, with counts reaching 104 CFU L-1. Together with the basidiomycetes Cryptococcus liquefaciens and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, these yeasts represent the stable core of the subglacial yeast communities. Other glacial ascomycetous species isolated included Candida parapsilosis and a putative new species that resembles Candida pseudorugosa. The archiascomycete Protomyces inouyei has seldom been detected anywhere in the world but was here recovered from ice in a glacier cave. The glacier meltwater contained only D. hansenii, whereas the seawater contained D. hansenii, Debaryomyces maramus, Pichia guilliermondii, what appears to represent a novel species resembling Candida galli and Metschnikowia bicuspidata. Only P. guilliermondii was isolated from sea ice, while snow/ice in the fjord tidal zone included C. parapsilosis, D. hansenii, P. guilliermondii and Metschnikowia zobellii. All of these isolated strains were characterized as psychrotolerant and xero/halotolerant, with the exception of P. inouyei. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  ABSTRACT = {Tundra and taiga ecosystems comprise nearly 40 % of the terrestrial landscapes of Canada. These permafrost ecosystems have supported humans for more than 4500 years, and are currently home to ca. 115,000 people, the majority of whom are First Nations, Inuit and Métis. The responses of these ecosystems to the regional warming over the past 30-50 years were the focus of four Canadian IPY projects. Northern residents and researchers reported changes in climate and weather patterns and noted shifts in vegetation and other environmental variables. In forest-tundra areas tree growth and reproductive effort correlated with temperature, but seedling establishment was often hindered by other factors resulting in site-specific responses. Increased shrub cover has occurred in sites across the Arctic at the plot and landscape scale, and this was supported by results from experimental warming. Experimental warming increased vegetation cover and nutrient availability in most tundra soils; however, resistance to warming was also found. Soil microbial diversity in tundra was no different than in other biomes, although there were shifts in mycorrhizal diversity in warming experiments. All sites measured were sinks for carbon during the growing season, with expected seasonal and latitudinal patterns. Modeled responses of a mesic tundra system to climate change showed that the sink status will likely continue for the next 50-100 years, after which these tundra systems will likely become a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. These IPY studies were the first comprehensive assessment of the state and change in Canadian northern terrestrial ecosystems and showed that the inherent variability in these systems is reflected in their site-specific responses to changes in climate. They also showed the importance of using local traditional knowledge and science, and provided extensive data sets, sites and researchers needed to study and manage the inevitable changes in the Canadian North. © 2012 The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Given that changes in the patterns of vegetation and size of carbon (C) pools in the Arctic are likely to be profound by the end of this century, it is necessary to characterise the identity and ecological groupings, in terms of temperature response and C substrate utilisation, of saprotrophic (decomposer) fungi in organic matter in Arctic soils. Thus, the aims of this study were: (1) to identify the fungi isolated from standing-dead material of Schistidium apocarpum, as an example of a High Arctic moss, (2) to determine mycelial extension rates of these fungi at a range of temperatures (4, 10 and 25 °C), and (3) to characterise the functional potential, defined by C substrate utilisation at 6 °C, of fungal taxa. Fungi were isolated at 4 °C from standing-dead material of S. apocarpum from an area of polar semi-desert (79 degrees N), close to Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, in the High Arctic. From a collection of 662 isolates, 43 pure cultures were identified by DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing. Phoma sclerotioides, previously known as a temperate snow mould, was isolated most frequently. The ecology of fifteen fungal isolates was characterised in detail. In terms of temperature response, two groups were apparent, one of truly psychrophilic/psychrotrophic fungi and one of more mesophilic fungi which were generally less frequently isolated. In terms of carbon substrate utilisation in semi-defined solid media, most fungi could utilise a variety of carbon substrates (degradation of casein, cellulose and starch was widespread), except for tannic acid (degraded by only two of the five P. sclerotioides isolates and Scytalidium lignicola) and lignin and chitin (not decomposed by any isolate). The majority of isolates had been recorded previously from polar environments and/or as being able to survive at low temperatures. Fungi in tundra ecosystems, therefore, have significant potential to mineralise C at temperatures below 10 °C. A better understanding of the ecology of these fungi will allow us to improve predictions of C dynamics in arctic biomes in the future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mycelial fungi in a solonchakous chestnut soil, a sulfate solonchak, and a soda solonchak were studied in the western Lake Baikal basin. The humus content, the degree of salinization, and the composition of salts affected the structure of the micromycete communities. In the chestnut soil, more than half of the species identified were found. The species diversity was higher in the nonsaline and humus horizons. The eolian deposit on the soda solonchak was characterized by the presence of six species of fungi that did not occur in other soil horizons. Their occurrence in the fresh deposit seems to be related to the eolian transfer of fungi with the fine earth from the adjacent areas with the nonsaline soils. The soda solonchak fungi are dominated by the haloalkalitolerant and alkalophilic micromycetes, among which the representatives of the Acremonium (A. antarcticum and A. rutilum) and Verticillum genera and Mycelia sterilia were identified. There was also an alkalophilic ascomycete, which is an indicator of soda salinization-Heleococcum alkalinum. On the whole, the soda solonchak had the lowest number of fungal germs and the lowest species diversity of mycelial fungi among the soils compared. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Throughout the history of polar exploration and up to recent times, wood and other exotic materials have been brought to the Antarctic continent and left there. While the possible transportation of exotic fungal species on these materials is sometimes considered, the effects of these exotic substrates on indigenous fungal communities have not been previously evaluated. This study reports results from seven plots where organic materials were used in baiting studies to determine the fungal diversity present in soils. Four plots were on islands in the Palmer Archipelago on the Antarctic Peninsula and three at Ross Island, Antarctica. Samples of sterile wood and cellulose with and without nutrients added were buried in soil and left for either two or four years before being removed and evaluated for fungal colonization. There was a significant increase in fungal colony-forming units (CFU) from soil in direct contact with introduced, sterile wood and cellulose substrates compared to background soil levels. The type of substrate, 2 or 4 year incubation period in the field, or nutrient addition did not have a significant effect on culturable densities in soil. Fungal abundance on soil adhering to substrates was found to be similar to that found in non-polar soils indicating that lack of organic material may be the most significant limiting factor affecting densities of Antarctic fungal populations. Based on a high degree of colonization, these exotic substrates appear to have a significant effect on indigenous soil fungal abundance. © 2010 Kevin D. Hyde.},

A number of filamentous fungi and yeasts have been documented from both - the hot and cold habitat - however, investigations on the abundance and activity of the filamentous hyphomycetes isolated are still missing. There is striking evidence that many ubiquitous species just survive in hot desert soil by their spores, however, without any physiological activity. There is also reasonable suspicion that man-made contamination of the Antarctic deserts might be the reason for finding a broad distribution of Penicillium and other ubiquitous fungi in soil and air. Basidiomycetous yeasts are reported to be endemic in the dry valley of Antarctica. Unrivaled conquerors of the desert environment are black, microcolonial fungi that are part of the epi- and endolithic community in hot and cold arid and semi-arid habitats. These fungi are one of the most stress-tolerant eukaryotic life forms on Earth. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi differ in their abilities to use nitrogen sources and may be integral to maintaining fungal and plant diversity in ecosystems in which Ericaceae occur. In this study, we tested whether the fungal communities differ among three species of co-occurring Ericaceae. Fungi colonizing Cassiope tetragona, Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea roots in the Arctic tundra were characterized via culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The cultured fungi were tested for their ability to colonize Vaccinium uliginosum in laboratory-based assays. The pure-cultured Helotiales were grouped into eight clades and dominated by the Phialocephala-Acephala complex. Representatives of these clades, plus an unknown basidiomycete with affinity to the genus Irpex (Polyporales), colonized V.uliginosum intracellularly. The Helotiales detected by direct PCR, cloning and sequencing were assigned to 14 clades and dominated by members of the Rhizoscyphus ericae complex. Ordination analyses indicated that culture-dependent and culture-independent assays provided distinct views of root fungal communities, but no evidence for host specificity. These data suggest that ericaceous roots host diverse fungal communities dominated by the Helotiales. However, these fungal communities are unlikely to be controlled by fungal host preferences. The mechanisms maintaining high diversity in root-symbiotic communities remain to be elucidated. © 2011 The Authors. New Phytologist © 2011 New Phytologist Trust.},

  ABSTRACT = {We utilized an automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) method as a more rapid alternative to classical morphological/nutritional identification and a less expensive alternative to sequencing for identification and grouping of isolates in culture-based fungal abundance studies. This method is well suited for the study of culturable Antarctic soil fungal communities where both abundance and diversity are relatively low. We optimized template concentration and verified the effect of primer selection from eight commonly used fungal polymerase chain reaction primers on ARISA chromatographs for 46 fungal species commonly isolated from south Victoria Land. A database of Antarctic fungal electropherograms was produced containing each of the species and was used as the first step in a tiered system for species identification. In addition, isolates containing more than one species were identified, allowing isolates not in the database to be sequenced for further analysis. This method unambiguously identified 78% of the fungal taxa in this study and we were able to rapidly determine which isolates should be subjected to further analysis by DNA sequencing. Using this approach, the cost of analysis for abundance studies can be greatly reduced compared to DNA sequencing of each isolate. © 2012 Antarctic Science Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Soil micromorphology provides an excellent resource for investigating Palaeoeskimo site-formation processes in the low arctic periglacial environment. In this study, micromorphology was used to answer questions concerning the composition, structure, origin and depositional agencies of the Tayara site active layer's sediments as well as to distinguish between natural (geogenic, biopedogenic) and cultural (anthropogenic) processes. Five groups of microfeatures were documented. These include 1) biopedological features (soil organic matter accumulation, mesofaunal and fungal activities), 2) transport-inherited features related to depositional processes (solifluction and stream sedimentation), 3) frost-induced microstructures and cryogenic features such as major post-depositional changes (ice-segregation, particle rearrangement, frost shattering, cryoturbation), 4) bone preservation in the active layer at the microscopic level, and 5) anthropogenic features related to Palaeoeskimo activities. The sediments from the three archaeological levels (I, IA and II) appear to have been very little influenced by anthropogenic factors. Cultural processes are micromorphologically observed in level II, with some evidence of feeding (bone presence), burning (wood charcoal, heated bone), and possibly trampling. However, the effects of natural processes on the sediments are more pronounced than anthropogenic ones. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Dwarf shrub heaths are common vegetation types of the Arctic and Subarctic. Some of the dominant plants in these communities release toxic substances which can affect neighbouring plants. We investigated the effects of leaf extracts from two dwarf shrubs, Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum hermaphroditum, and from mountain birch, Betula pubescens spp. tortuosa, on nematode community structure and reproduction in a pot and an agar culture experiment. In pots two graminoids, Carex bigelowii and Festuca vivipara, were grown in previously sterilized or non-sterilized soil. Soil was collected from a subarctic heath, and plants from a fellfield site, near Abisko, northern Swedish Lapland. The naturally occurring nematode community at the heath site is also described. A total of 34 nematode taxa were observed at the field site and 32 taxa in the pot experiment. Most species, especially frequent taxa, occurred in both soils. Potted soil was strongly dominated by bacterial feeders and showed a shift towards a more colonizer controlled population. These changes were presumably due to the establishment of residual species after freezing and/or sterilization of the soil prior to incubation in the laboratory. Direct exposure of the nematode Aphelenchoides saprophilus to the leaf extracts in agar cultures resulted in a lower reproduction rate. Leaf extract treatment in potted soil altered nematode species composition and dominance structure, and generally reduced species number and maturity index. The diversity of genera was decreased by all extract treatments in pots with Carex. Nematode population density was not affected, except after application of Betula extracts, where significantly higher densities occurred. Nematode data were related to respiration and active fungal biomass in the soil, indicating that rather than allelochemicals with nematicidal properties, carbohydrates in the leaf extracts promoting a beneficial microflora may have affected the nematode community. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fungi have been only rarely isolated from glacial ice in extremely cold polar regions and were in these cases considered as random, long-term preserved Aeolian deposits. Fungal presence has so far not been investigated in polar subglacial ice, a recently discovered extreme habitat reported to be inhabited exclusively by heterotrophic bacteria. In this study we report on the very high occurrence (up to 9000 CFU L-1) and diversity of filamentous Penicillium spp. in the sediment-rich subglacial ice of three different polythermal Arctic glaciers (Svalbard, Norway). The dominant species was P. crustosum, representing on the average half of all isolated strains from all three glaciers. The other most frequently isolated species were P. bialowiezense, P. chrysogenum, P. thomii, P. solitum, P. palitans, P. echinulatum, P. polonicum, P. commune, P. discolor, P. expansum, and new Penicillium species (sp. 1). Twelve more Penicillium species were occasionally isolated. The fungi isolated produced consistent profiles of secondary metabolites, not different from the same Penicillium species from other habitats. This is the first report on the presence of large populations of Penicillium spp. in subglacial sediment-rich ice. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two species of lichens, six cyanobacteria, one diatom, 10 chlorophytes and two mycelial fungi were found at La Gorce Mountains (86°30'S, 147°W) at an altitude of about 1750 m. The lichens Lecidea cancriformis and Carbonea vorticosa occurred at a single site which is the most southerly record of lichens. Thousands of small ponds covered extensive ice-cored moraine. Nine ponds sampled had about 30 cm of ice overlying about 26 cm of water and contained algal mats dominated by Phormidium autumnale and cf. Leptolyngbyafragilis. The very low conductivity waters had high nitrate and low dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations. Of 124 soil samples, five contained visible algae. In 32 there were only microscopic growths but no algae were detected in 87 samples, possibly because of lack of water for much of summer. A visible mat dominated by Hammatoidea normanni occurred in a rock fissure at the lichen site. At Price Bluff, green patches of Desmococcus cf. olivaceus, up to 20 cm2, were scattered over the moraine. Growths were revealed at the soil-ice interface when overlying soil up to one centimetre thick was removed. It is suggested that although dispersal of algae from local populations may be readily achieved establishment of populations is a rare event outside the pond environment.},

  ABSTRACT = {Almost all of the investigated samples of the Arctic and Antarctic permafrost sediments of different genesis with ages from 5-10 thousand to 2-3 million years were found to contain viable micromycete and bacterial cells. The maximum amounts of viable cells of fungi (up to 104 CFU/g air-dried sample) and bacteria (up to 107-109 CFU/g air-dried sample) were present in fine peaty sediment samples taken from different depths. The identified micromycetes belonged to more than 20 genera of the divisions Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota, and some represented mitosporic fungi. Thawing the samples at 35 and 52°C allowed the number of detected fungal genera to be increased by more than 30%. Aerobic heterotrophic prokaryotes were dominated by coryneform, nocardioform, and spore-forming microorganisms of the order Actinomycetales. Analysis of the isolated fungi and actinomycetes showed that most of them originated from the microbial communities of ancient terrestrial biocenoses. © 2001 MAIK "Nauka/Interperiodica".},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding the relationship between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is critical to predicting and monitoring the effects of ecosystem changes on important soil processes. However, most of Earth's soils are too biologically diverse to identify each species present and determine their functional role in food webs. The soil ecosystems of Victoria Land (VL) Antarctica are functionally and biotically simple, and serve as in situ models for determining the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem processes. For a few VL taxa (microarthropods, nematodes, algae, mosses and lichens), species diversity has been intensively assessed in highly localized habitats, but little is known of how community assemblages vary across broader spatial scales, or across latitudinal and environmental gradients. The composition of tardigrade, rotifer, protist, fungal and prokaryote communities is emerging. The latter groups are the least studied, but potentially the most diverse. Endemism is highest for microarthropods and nematodes, less so for tardigrades and rotifers, and apparently low for mosses, lichens, protists, fungi and prokaryotes. Much of what is known about VL diversity and distribution occurs in an evolutionary and ecological vacuum; links between taxa and functional role in ecosystems are poorly known and future studies must utilize phylogenetic information to infer patterns of community assembly, speciation, extinction, population processes and biogeography. However, a comprehensive compilation of all the species that participate in soil ecosystem processes, and their distribution across regional and landscape scales is immediately achievable in VL with the resources, tools, and expertise currently available. We suggest that the soil ecosystems of VL should play a major role in exploring the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and in monitoring the effects of environmental change on soil processes in real time and space. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  ABSTRACT = {Stratospheric ozone depletion occurs over Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, in the austral spring and summer due to the Antarctic 'ozone hole' and the general erosion of the ozone layer. Thus, we investigated the responses of microbial communities to manipulations of solar UV-B radiation. Results reported here are for field plots receiving either near-ambient or reduced solar UV-B using plastic filters in a Sphagnum peatland and a Carex fen during the second and third years of UV-B manipulations. The total number of testate amoebae (Protozoa, Rhizopoda) inhabiting the upper centimeter of Sphagnum magellanicum was greater under near-ambient solar UV-B than under reduced UV-B. No response to UV-B manipulation was apparent for rotifers, nematodes, bacteria, microfungi, and a common microalga (Euglena mutabilis) inhabiting the S. magellanicum. On leaves of small Nothofagus antarctica trees, the ratio of upper: lower leaf-surface fungal populations for the genus Aureobasidium and for total fungi indicated lower populations on the upper, relative to the lower, surface under near-ambient solar UV-B. When responses to modifications of the solar UV-B flux were detected, these involved both direct UV-B inhibition and indirect consequences of UV-B manipulation. © New Phytologist (2001).},

  ABSTRACT = {Climate change may influence the relationship between arctic plants and their symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. The benefit of the symbiosis for the host plant affects vegetation succession and may be a key parameter in predicting vegetation responses to warming. We investigated the mycorrhizal benefit in the low arctic perennial herbs Potentilla crantzii and Ranunculus acris in symbiosis with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus claroideum. Temperature response in the mycorrhiza-mediated acquisition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), growth, and photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency were determined. Near the average natural soil temperature (12°C), mycorrhiza did not improve plant nutrient capture but significantly enhanced plant P capture at 17°C. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency was higher at 17°C than at 12°C and was further increased by mycorrhiza at 178C. Photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency was not affected by temperature or mycorrhiza. Increasing the growing temperature by 5°C increased the relative shoot growth rate by 15%. Mycorrhizal symbiosis did not enhance plant growth rate, but the plants gained between 20% and 90% more mycorrhiza-mediated P when grown at higher temperature. The results suggest that these low arctic species have good potential to respond positively to increasing temperatures.},

  ABSTRACT = {The occurrence and distribution of culturable fungi in Taylor Valley, Antarctica was assessed in terms of soil habitat. Soil transects throughout the valley revealed differential habitat utilization between filamentous and non-filamentous (yeast and yeast-like) fungi. In addition, there were significant differences in species distribution patterns with respect to soil pH, moisture, distance from marine coastline, carbon, chlorophyll a, salinity, elevation and solar inputs. Filamentous fungal abundance is most closely associated with habitats having higher pH, and soil moistures. These close associations were not found with yeast and yeast-like fungi demonstrating that yeast and yeast-like fungi utilize a broader range of habitat. An intensive survey of the Victoria Land is necessary to gain a better understanding of their role in soil functioning and nutrient cycling processes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper reports the effects of nutrient availability, UV radiation and temperature on the taxa composition and abundance of Antarctic soil mycobiota. Two sites at Edmonson Point were studied: the first was poor in nutrients, near the glacier, and the second was close to bird nesting sites. The highest abundance of soil fungi was recorded at the site adjacent to the bird nesting sites. Phoma herbarum was the most abundant taxon. Lecytophora lignicola and Ascotricha erinacea are new records for continental Antarctica. The fungal assemblage from the nutrient-deficient site was characterized by a dominance-diversity curve approaching the broken-stick model, the assemblage from the soil influenced by birds was characterized by a lognormal distribution. Plastic cloches were used in experiments designed to assess differences in fungal assemblages subjected to altered temperature and/or UV exposure. Dominance-diversity curves and diversity values of soil fungal mycobiota were compared in their natural condition as compared with manipulated conditions. Under the walled cloches, at both sites, artificial warming led to stress on Antarctic soil fungal assemblages. In contrast, UV protection led to a higher equilibrium in the assemblage structure. On the basis of the results obtained, it could be proposed that UV radiation is the most important limiting ecological factor for soil mycobiota in continental Antarctica. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

  ABSTRACT = {Juvenile development has been investigated for the first time in an Antarctic lichen species - Usnea antarctica - in the northern maritime Antarctic, Livingston Island (South Shetland Islands, 62°27'-62°48'S, 59°45'-61°15'W). Here, U. antarctica grows on rocks and forms the dominant vegetation on this site together with a few other macrolichens. This species reproduces mainly by vegetative diaspores (soredia), which include both the photobiont and the mycobiont. To understand the early ontogenetic strategies in U. antarctica, culture experiments were performed in an Antarctic field site where the species occurs naturally. This paper focuses on the different developmental steps seen between the initial colonization of soredia to the formation of a small well-developed thallus, and also on the growth rate of the respective juvenile stages. Compared with growth rates of lichens from temperate European regions the early development of U. antarctica is extraordinarily slow, taking 5-6 years until an adult thallus has been formed. The low photobiont content in the juvenile stages probably limits the growth rate. It is suggested that juvenile development of U. antarctica is controlled by a combination of ecophysiological and morphological adaptations that are required for success in extreme environments such as the terrestrial habitats of the Antarctic.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mammal grazing is composed of three mechanisms-removal of foliar tissue (defoliation), return of nutrients via dung and urine (fertilization), and trampling. To evaluate the relative role of these mechanisms in the effect of reindeer grazing on soil biota in northern grasslands, we subjected experimental plots in a sub-arctic alpine meadow to defoliation, fertilization (using NPK-solution), simulated trampling, and their factorial combinations once a year from 2002 to 2004 and measured the response of plants and decomposers (including microbes, nematodes, collembolans, and enchytraeids) in 2004. Trampling affected both plant and decomposer communities: the coverage of the moss Pleurozium schreberi and the sedge Carex vaginata, as well as the abundance of collembolans and enchytraeids were reduced in trampled plots. Trampling and fertilization also interacted significantly, with fertilization increasing the abundance of bacteria and bacterial-feeding and omnivorous nematodes in trampled plots only, and trampling decreasing fungal biomass in non-fertilized plots only. Defoliation had no overall effects on plants or decomposers. Nematode genera were not affected by the experimental treatments, but nematode and plant communities were significantly associated, and all decomposer biota, except collembolans, were strongly affected by the spatial heterogeneity of the study site. Our results indicate that trampling may have larger and defoliation and fertilization smaller roles than anticipated in explaining reindeer grazing effects in sub-arctic grasslands. However, even the effects of trampling seem to be outweighed by the spatial heterogeneity of decomposer abundances. This suggests that in sub-arctic grasslands spatial variation in abiotic factors can be a more important factor than grazing in controlling soil biota abundances. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  ABSTRACT = {Root and soil samples from 13 collecting sites located in the Canadian High Arctic were harvested between July 18 and 29, 1991, and surveyed for root colonization and spore populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Grasses of the genus Festuca (Festuca brachyphylla Schult. and Schult., Festuca baffinensis Polunin, and Festuca hyperborea Holmen ex Frederiksen) served as target plants. Of the 197 plant-root systems and soil rhizospheres examined, 28% were associated with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Roots of both F. brachyphylla and F. baffinensis were colonized, while none were detected in F. hyperborea root specimens. Five arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species were extracted from indigenous soils. The most frequent and abundant species was Glomus mosseae (Nicol. and Gerd.) Gerdemann and Trappe, which was isolated from 8 of the 13 sites sampled. Other Glomales species in Arctic soils were Glomus macrocarpum Tul and Tul., Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxter sensu Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe emend. Walker and Koske, and two other unidentified Glomus species. Trap cultures of the indigenous soil with leek (Allium porrum L.) plants confirmed the identity of the species previously identified from original soil and allowed the detection of an additional species, Glomus aggregatum Schenck. and Smith. The novelty of these observations and the relationship between plant mycorrhizal status., fungal species, and soil disturbance are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {There is some evidence that microbes inhabiting permanently frozen environments are capable of cell maintenance and growth under in situ conditions. In contrast, Arctic tundra surface soils that are only frozen during the winter have exhibited CO2 respiration under frozen conditions. This could result from maintenance metabolism fuelled by recycling cell material, but does necessarily indicate growth, which requires the synthesis of new cell material. We used 13C-glucose to trace C into membrane lipids and 5-bromo-3-deoxyuridine to monitor DNA synthesis in a laboratory microcosm study on Arctic tundra soils. Organisms were not equally active: fungi incorporated more C than any other group. Although some bacteria were growing, Gram(+) bacteria were almost completely inactive. Shrub tundra microbes were more active in early winter than tussock microbes, incorporating more C and synthesizing more DNA. In late winter, the C incorporation pattern reversed, although DNA production was similar. We demonstrated for the first time that microbes in frozen tundra soils synthesized new cell membranes and DNA, processes fundamentally associated with growth. That microbes can grow during Arctic winters may have important implications for C cycle modelling under a changing climate. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Soils in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica are considered to be among the world's most extreme environments. These soils are old, cold and dry with low contents of organic carbon and nitrogen. Habitats adjacent to water (lakes and ice melts) have significant biological activity as demonstrated by the presence of algal mats, lichens and small invertebrates, particularly nematodes, tardigrades and rotifers. In contrast, there are extensive areas in the Dry Valleys that are extremely dry with less than 5% moisture content. These soils are often salty and appear to be barren of life as they have a coarse texture due to their lack of plant organic material. In contrast, molecular techniques (DNA extraction from soils, cloning and rDNA sequence analysis) demonstrated the presence of a complex micro-eukaryotic food web whose structure and composition varied with moisture content and location. Micro-eukaryotic communities in soils with 0.2-1.3% moisture were represented by species of the yeast genus Trichosporon and an unidentified clade of micro-eukaryotes, whereas levels from 3.1% to 4.9% contained complex food webs including primary producers (chlorophytes and stramenopiles), symbionts (lichen associated fungi), saprophytes (fungi), predators (alveolates and cercozoans) and fungal nematode parasite/pathogens. The soils had a diversity of species (80 species from 15 sites) with a restricted number (3-21 species) at each site. The sensitive and measurable community structure of the low moisture Dry Valley soils provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine local and global environmental effects on micro-eukaryotic community dynamics with multiple trophic levels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Species were F. acuminatum (25 isolates, found in 26.3% of the 95 soil samples), F. avenaceum (28 isolates,29.5%),F.culmorum(\ isolate, 1.1 %),F. oxysporum(31 isolates,32.6%),andF. sambucinum (40 isolates, 42.1%). The isolates were grown on a solid rice substrate, incorporated as 50% of a rodent diet and fed to rats to determine their toxicity. Sixty-four per cent of the isolates caused death and 44% of the isolates caused congestion and hemorrhage of various tissues including stomach, intestine, thymus, and hematuria in the bladder. One isolate caused uterine enlargement. All isolates caused decreased weight gain relative to the control diets. The toxicity of Fusarium isolates recovered from the soil samples was remarkable, particularly in F. oxysporum (25 out of 31 (80%) were toxic) and F. sambucinum (39/40 = 97%) reported for the first time.

  ABSTRACT = {The effect of 36 lm-2 of 20% and 100% methanol spillage on the microflora of a soil near Inuvik, N.W.T. was assessed. Gas-liquid chromatography was used to monitor the residual methanol in the soil. Associated with residual methanol determination were measurements of changes in numbers of bacteria, fungal standing crop, respiration and isolation of methanol utilizing bacteria. Twenty percent methanol spillage had two different effects on the surface vegetation, in that the vegetation was killed in some plots and not others. The applied methanol disappeared completely between 1 and 4 weeks. No increased soil activity (as indicated by respiration, bacterial numbers, fungal standing crop) was detected when methanol was present in the soil. Because only one bacterium (i.e. pink gram negative rods) metabolized only very small concentrations of methanol, it was concluded that biodegradation of methanol was not a significant agent affecting methanol loss from the soil. © 1978 D.

  ABSTRACT = {Among the well-known ultrasaline terrestrial habitats, the Dead Sea in the Jordan Rift Valley and Don Juan Pond in the Upper Wright Valley represent two of the most extreme. The former is a saturated sodium chloride-magnesium sulfate brine in a hot desert, the latter a saturated calcium chloride brine in an Antarctic desert. Both Dead Sea and Don Juan water bodies themselves are limited in microflora, but the saline Don Juan algal mat and muds contain abundant nutrients and a rich and varied microbiota, including Oscillatoria, Gleocapsa, Chlorella, diatoms, Penicillium and bacteria. In such environments, the existence of an array of specific adaptations is a common, and highly reasonable, presumption, at least with respect to habitat-obligate forms. Nevertheless, many years of ongoing study in our laboratory have demonstrated that lichens (e.g. Cladonia), algae (e.g. Nostoc) and fungi (e.g. Penicillium, Aspergillus) from the humid tropics can sustain metabolism down to -40°C and growth down to -10°C in simulated Dead Sea or Don Juan (or similar) media without benefit of selection or gradual acclimation. Non-selection is suggested in fungi by higher growth rates from vegetative inocula than spores. The importance of nutrient parameters was also evident in responses to potassium and reduced nitrogen compounds. In view of the saline performance of tropical Nostoc, and its presence in the Antarctic dry valley soils, its complete absence in our Don Juan mat samples was and remains a puzzle. We suggest that adaptive capability is already resident in many terrestrial life forms not currently in extreme habitats, a possible reflection of evolutionary selection for wide spectrum environmental adaptability. © 1984 D.

  ABSTRACT = {The aim of this investigation was to provide a general description of the biota and environment of fumarolic ground close to the summit (2733 m) of Mt Melbourne. Heat flow through the ground was examined and analyses made of the physico-chemical properties of the soil. Bryophyte vegetation comprised Campylopus pyriformis (K.F. Schultz) Brid. and Cephaloziella exiliflora (Tayl.) Steph. The former is a new antarctic record. These grew as scattered and confluent cushions where surface ground temperatures ranged between 14°-31°C. Algae were epiphytic on bryophytes and formed crusts over most other areas of warm ground. Six species of cyanophytes and five unicellular chlorophytes are described. The majority were mesophilic but Mastigocladus laminosus showed a strong preference for soil temperatures >30°C. A loosely lichenised chlorophyte was also encountered. The only soil fauna was a testate amoeba, Corythion dibium. Heterotrophic microorganisms included thermotolerant fungi, actinomycetes and bacteria as well as typical mesophilic microflora. Nitrogen fixation, analysed using both C2H2 reduction and15N2 enrichment, occured in bryophyte cushions and surface algal crusts containing M. laminosus and in sub-surface samples lacking cyanophytes. The biota are compared with those found at other thermal localities in Antarctica and the dispersal of propagules to these areas is discussed. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

Sampling was carried out during austral summer 1992/1993 at different sites in the vicinity of Arctewski Station. The sites were located at areas with different plant cover. Soil samples were taken to a depth of 50 cm. All microscopic analyses were carried out in the laboratory immediately after sampling. The bacterial community showed great variations related to soil organic matter and plant cover. Highest values of number and biomass of bacteria were found in the surface layers as well as on leaves of Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis. Lichen (Usnea antarctica, U. aurantiaco-atra) were much less covered with bacteria. Mean cell volume of bacteria can be regarded as an important descriptor of the bacterial community. Changes in this parameter can be related to environmental factors. Fungi and yeasts were seldom observed. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {SUMMARY. 1. Several dozen summer meltwater streams are located in the McMurdo Sound region (c. 78°S 165°E) of southern Victoria Land. They are characterized by a highly variable flow regime at diel, seasonal and annual times caleis; wide fluctuations in temperature and nutrient content; and a very simple epilithic community of cyanophytes (Nostoc spp., Oscillatoriaceae), bacteria, fungi and microherbivores. 2. The epilithon survives the dark Antarctic winter as dry, frozen mats which provide a large inoculum for growth the following summer. This overwintering assemblage retains a high metabolic capacity and responds rapidly to rehydration. 3. In a series of artificial substrate experiments, biomass accumulation rates were generally less than 0.1 In units d−1. Colonization and growth on the substrates was inversely related to the suspended sediment load of the stream. There was also a visual correspondence between per cent algal cover of the natural streambed and the clarity of the streamwater. Sloughing losses may limit community biomass, particularly in the turbid flowing waters. 4. During running water conditions the mature communities had very low gross photosynthetic rates per unit chlorophyll (<0,1 μg C (μg chl a.h)−1 and per unit carbon (<0,2 μg C (mg biomass C.h)−1). Respiration was generally a high percentage (up to 92%) of gross photosynthesis, which probably reflected the high population densities of microheterotrophs in the community. 5. The floristically simple epilithic mats slowly accumulate to extreme biomass levels (>20 μg chl a cm −2, <20 mg C cm−2). Production rates per unit biomass are low, probably in response to the cold temperatures of the Antarctic stream environment, and the accumulated biomass represents several seasons of growth.
