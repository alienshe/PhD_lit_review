The absolute stereostructures of the isolated cyclopianes were determined using modified Mosher’s method and quantum chemical calculations of the ECD spectra. The isolation from the natural source of two biosynthetic precursors of cladosporin from a natural source has been reported for the first time. The antimicrobial activities of the isolated compounds against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans as well as the inhibition of staphylococcal sortase A activity were investigated. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the compounds to mammalian cardiomyocytes H9c2 was studied.

  abstract={Aspergillus fumigatus is a common opportunistic pathogen in different animals, including birds such as penguins. For the first time, a fungal strain identified as A. fumigatus was isolated from soil in the nests of gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua, on Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands (maritime Antarctica). This isolate (A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829) displayed a series of potentially pathogenic characteristics in vitro. We evaluated its detailed molecular taxonomy and submitted the A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829 Antarctic strain to in vivo pathogenic modelling. The isolate was confirmed to represent A. fumigatus morphological and phylogenetic analysis showed that it was closely related to A. fumigatus sequences reported from animals, immunosuppressed humans, storage grains, plants and soils. The strain displayed the best mycelial growth and conidia production at 37 ºC; however, it was also able to grow and produce conidia at 15º, demonstrating its capability to survive and colonize penguin nest at least in the summer season in maritime Antarctica. In pathogenicity tests, healthy mice did not showed symptoms of infection; however, 50% lethality was observed in immunosuppressed mice that were inoculated with 106 and 107 spores. Lethality increased to 100% when inoculated with 108 spores. Our data highlight the potential pathogenicity of opportunistic A. fumigatus that may be present in the Antarctic, and the risks of both their further transfer within Antarctica and outwards to other continents, risks which may be exacerbated due global climatic changes. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.},

  abstract={In the Arctic ecosystems, fungi are crucial for interactions between soil and plants, the cycling of nutrients, and the transport of carbon. To date, no studies have been conducted to thoroughly examine the mycobiome and its functional role in various habitats of the High Arctic region. The aim was to unravel the mycobiome in the nine habitats (i.e., soil, lichen, vascular plant, moss, freshwater, seawater, marine sediment, dung, and marine alga) in the Ny-Ålesund Region (Svalbard, High Arctic) using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 10,419 ASVs were detected. Among them, 7535 ASVs were assigned to unidentified phyla, while the remaining 2884 ASVs were assigned to 11 phyla, 33 classes, 81 orders, 151 families, 278 genera, and 261 species that were known. The distribution of the mycobiome was driven by habitat specificity, indicating that habitat filtering is a crucial factor influencing the fungal assemblages at a local scale in this High Arctic region. Six growth forms and 19 fungal guilds were found. The ecological guild (e.g., lichenized, ectomycorrhizal) and growth form (e.g., yeast, thallus photosynthetic) varied significantly among various habitats. In addition, the occurrence of 31 fungal species that are considered to be potential pathogens was determined. These results will increase our understanding of fungal diversity and its functional significance in this distinctive High Arctic area and thereby establish the groundwork for prediction about how the mycobiome will alter in various environments as a result of anticipated climate change. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Rapid climate change in the Arctic is altering microbial structure and function, with important consequences for the global ecosystem. Emerging evidence suggests organisms in higher trophic levels may also influence microbial communities, but whether warming alters these effects is unclear. Wolf spiders are dominant Arctic predators whose densities are expected to increase with warming. These predators have temperature-dependent effects on decomposition via their consumption of fungal-feeding detritivores, suggesting they may indirectly affect the microbial structure as well. To address this, we used a fully factorial mesocosm experiment to test the effects of wolf spider density and warming on litter microbial structure in Arctic tundra. We deployed replicate litter bags at the surface and belowground in the organic soil profile and analyzed the litter for bacterial and fungal community structure, mass loss, and nutrient characteristics after 2 and 14 months. We found there were significant interactive effects of wolf spider density and warming on fungal but not bacterial communities. Specifically, higher wolf spider densities caused greater fungal diversity under ambient temperature but lower fungal diversity under warming at the soil surface. We also observed interactive treatment effects on fungal composition belowground. Wolf spider density influenced surface bacterial composition, but the effects did not change with warming. These findings suggest a widespread predator can have indirect, cascading effects on litter microbes and that effects on fungi specifically shift under future expected levels of warming. Overall, our study highlights that trophic interactions may play important, albeit overlooked, roles in driving microbial responses to warming in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems.

  abstract={Antarctic soils provide an excellent setting to test biogeographical patterns across spatial and environmental scales given their relatively simple communities and the dominance of physical factors that create strong environmental gradients. Additional urgency is given by the fact that their unique terrestrial communities are the subject of conservation efforts in a rapidly changing environment. We investigated relationships of soil community assembly and alpha and beta diversity with climatic and environmental parameters across regional and local scales in Maritime Antarctica. We sampled from a regional gradient of sites that differ in habitat severity, ranging from relatively favourable to harsher physicochemical conditions. At the regional scale, bacterial community characteristics and microarthropod abundance varied along this severity gradient, but most measures of fungal communities did not. Microarthropod and microbial communities differed in which soil and climate parameters were most influential, and the specific parameters that influenced each taxon differed across broad and fine spatial scales. This suggests that conservation efforts will need to focus on a large variety of habitat characteristics to successfully encompass diversity across taxa. Because beta diversity was the result of species turnover, conservation efforts also cannot focus on only the most biodiverse sites to effectively preserve all aspects of biodiversity.

  abstract={The high-latitude regions of Antarctica remain among the most remote, extreme, and least explored areas on Earth. Still, microbial life has been reported in these environments, with limited information on their genetic properties and functional capabilities. Although diverse autochthonous multidrug-resistant bacteria were found in Antarctic Peninsula soils, posing whether these soils could act as a source of resistance determinants that could emerge among pathogens, we still lack information regarding the resistome of areas closer to the South Pole. Moreover, no previous studies have evaluated the pathogenic potential of microbes inhabiting Antarctic soils. In this work, we combined metagenomic and culture-dependent approaches to investigate the microbial diversity, resistome, virulome, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in soils from Union Glacier, a cold desert in West Antarctica. Despite the extreme conditions, several bacterial phyla were found, predominating Actinomycetota and Pseudomonadota, with limited archaeal and fungal taxa. Contrastive with Ecology Glacier soils from King George Island, the Union Glacier soil bacterial community is significantly less diverse, mainly attributed to scarce moisture. We recovered >80 species-level representative genomes (SRGs) of predominant bacteria and an ammonia-oxidating nitrogen- and carbon-fixing archaeon from a novel species of Nitrosocosmicus. Several resistance and virulence genes were found in Union Glacier soils, similar to those in other Antarctic cold desert areas but significantly distinct from those observed in maritime Antarctica and other non-cryosphere biomes. Furthermore, we characterized bacterial isolates resistant to up to 24 clinical antibiotics, mainly Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Plantibacter, and Flavobacterium. Moreover, some isolates produced putative virulence factors, including siderophores, pyocyanins, and exoenzymes with hemolytic, lecithinase, protease, and DNAse activity. This evidence uncovers a largely unexplored resistome and virulome hosted by deep Antarctica's soil microbial communities and the presence of bacteria with pathogenic potential, highlighting the relevance of One Health approaches for environmental surveillance in this continent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Climate warming holds the potential to cause extensive drying of wetlands in the Arctic, but the warming-drying effects on belowground ecosystems, particularly micro-eukaryotes, remain poorly understood. We investigated the responses of soil micro-eukaryotic communities, including fungi, protists, and microbial metazoa, to decadal drainage manipulation in a Siberian wet tundra using both amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results indicate that drainage treatment increased the abundance of both fungal and non-fungal micro-eukaryotic communities, with key groups such as Ascomycota (mostly order Helotiales), Nematoda, and Tardigrada being notably abundant in drained sites. Functional traits analysis showed an increase in litter saprotrophic fungi and protistan consumers, indicating their increased activities in drained sites. The effects of drainage were more pronounced in the surface soil layer than the deeper layer, as soils dry and warm from the surface. Marked compositional shifts were observed for both communities, with fungal communities being more strongly influenced by drainage-induced vegetation change than the lowered water table itself, while the vegetation effect on non-fungal micro-eukaryotes was moderate. These findings provide insights into how belowground micro-eukaryotic communities respond to the widespread drying of wetlands in the Arctic and improve our predictive understanding of future ecosystem changes.

Unknown fungi identified at higher hierarchical taxonomic levels (Fungal sp. 1, Fungal sp. 2, Spizellomycetales sp. and Rozellomycotina sp.) and taxa identified at generic and specific levels (Mortierella sp., Pseudogymnoascus sp., Mortierella alpina, M. turficola, Neoascochyta paspali, Penicillium sp. and Betamyces sp.) dominated the assemblages. In general, the assemblages displayed high diversity and richness, and moderate dominance. Only 12 of the fungal ASVs were detected in all chronosequence soils sampled. Sequences representing saprophytic, pathogenic and symbiotic fungi were detected. Based on the sequence diversity obtained, Clearwater Mesa soils contain a complex fungal community, including the presence of fungal groups generally considered rare in Antarctica, with dominant taxa recognized as cold-adapted cosmopolitan, endemic, saprotrophic and phytopathogenic fungi.

  abstract={Lichens have developed numerous adaptations to optimise their survival under harsh abiotic stress, colonise different substrates, and reach substantial population sizes and high coverage in ice-free Antarctic areas, benefiting from a symbiotic lifestyle. As lichen thalli represent consortia with an unknown number of participants, it is important to know about the accessory organisms and their relationships with various environmental conditions. To this end, we analysed lichen-associated communities from Himantormia lugubris, Placopsis antarctica, P. contortuplicata, and Ramalina terebrata, collected from soils with differing deglaciation times, using a metabarcoding approach. In general, many more Ascomycete taxa are associated with the investigated lichens compared to Basidiomycota. Given our sampling, a consistently higher number of lichen-associated eukaryotes are estimated to be present in areas with deglaciation times of longer than 5000 years compared to more recently deglaciated areas. Thus far, members of Dothideomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Arthoniomycetes have been restricted to the Placopsis specimens from areas with deglaciation times longer than 5000 years. Striking differences between the associated organisms of R. terebrata and H. lugubris have also been discovered. Thus, a species-specific basidiomycete, Tremella, was revealed for R. terebrata, as was a member of Capnodiales for H. lugubris. Our study provides further understanding of the complex terricolous lichen-associated mycobiome using the metabarcoding approach. It also illustrates the necessity to extend our knowledge of complex lichen symbiosis and further improve the coverage of microbial eukaryotes in DNA barcode libraries, including more extended sampling. © 2023 by the authors.},

The fungal assemblages present in the different ornithogenically influenced soils displayed different diversity indices. However, in general, we detected high fungal diversity and few taxa shared between the samples. Despite the polyextreme environmental conditions experienced in these Antarctic soils, the metabarcoding approach detected a rich and complex fungal community dominated by saprophytes, but with some pathogenic taxa also present. The community was dominated by psychrophilic and psychrotolerant taxa, some apparently endemic to Antarctica, and those identified only at higher taxonomic levels, which may represent currently undescribed fungi. The mycobiome detected included taxa characterized by different ecological roles, including saprotrophic, human- and animal-associated, phytopathogenic, mutualistic, and cosmopolitan.

  abstract={Snow is the largest component of the cryosphere, with its cover and distribution rapidly decreasing over the last decade due to climate warming. It is imperative to characterize the snow (nival) microbial communities to better understand the role of microorganisms inhabiting these rapidly changing environments. Here, we investigated the core nival microbiome, the cultivable microbial members, and the microbial functional diversity of the remote Uapishka mountain range, a massif of alpine sub-arctic tundra and boreal forest. Snow samples were taken over a two-month interval along an altitude gradient with varying degree of anthropogenic traffic and vegetation cover. The core snow alpine tundra/boreal microbiome, which was present across all samples, constituted of Acetobacterales, Rhizobiales and Acidobacteriales bacterial orders, and of Mycosphaerellales and Lecanorales fungal orders, with the dominant fungal taxa being associated with lichens. The snow samples had low active functional diversity, with Richness values ranging from 0 to 19.5. The culture-based viable microbial enumeration ranged from 0 to 8.05 × 103 CFUs/mL. We isolated and whole-genome sequenced five microorganisms which included three fungi, one alga, and one potentially novel bacterium of the Lichenihabitans genus; all of which appear to be part of lichen-associated taxonomic clades. © The Author(s) 2023.

Given the limited knowledge on microbial diversity, this study aimed to compile, analyze and compare a subset of the biobank of Antarctic fungi maintained at the UNESP’s Central of Microbial Resources (CRM-UNESP). A total of 711 isolates (240 yeasts and 471 filamentous fungi) from marine and terrestrial samples collected at King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) were used with the primary objective of investigating their presence in both marine and terrestrial environments. Among the yeasts, 13 genera were found, predominantly belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. Among the filamentous fungi, 34 genera were represented, predominantly from the phylum Ascomycota. The most abundant genera in the marine samples were Metschnikowia, Mrakia, and Pseudogymnoascus, while in the terrestrial samples, they were Pseudogymnoascus, Leucosporidium, and Mortierella. Most of the genera and species of the CRM-UNESP biobank of Antarctic fungi are being reported as an important target for biotechnological applications.

  abstract={Abstract: The chemical and microbiological properties of urban soils (Urbic Technosols) of Murmansk (Russia) are compared with those in podzols (Albic Podzols) of the background area. Urban soils display increased pH values and higher contents of major biogenic elements: C, N, P, and K, especially pronounced in subsoil horizons. In the urban topsoils, the number of cultured bacteria are increased (saprotrophs, to 3–6 × 106 CFU/g and oligotrophs, to 4.5–8 × 106 CFU/g), whereas the number of cultured microscopic fungi are decreased by two orders of magnitude (to 103 CFU) as compared with native podzols. As for the urban subsoil horizons, the number of all groups of microorganisms are increased as compared with the background. The diversity of micromycete complexes in urban soils follows the same pattern. Spatial nonuniformity of the species composition and structure of microfungal complexes is observed in the urban topsoils versus the subsoils, which display a relative uniformity of the dominant species composition (Trichocladium griseum, relative abundance of 41–77%). The share and abundance of BSL-1 and BSL-2 opportunistic micromycetes increase in the urban topsoils to 50–60% versus native podzols with the share of 30%. The degree of mycological hazard in urban soils varies from dangerous to safe (index of mycological hazard Im values are from 7–20 in the city center to 1.5–3.6 in the suburbs). The results demonstrate that urbanization in the Arctic not only changes the chemical properties of soils but also creates a new niche for microorganisms in subsoil horizons. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.},

  abstract={The influence of climate change on microbial communities inhabiting the sparsely vegetated patterned ground soils that are widespread across the High Arctic is poorly understood. Here, in a four-year experiment on Svalbard, we warmed patterned ground soil with open top chambers and biannually irrigated the soil to predict the responses of its microbial community to rising temperatures and precipitation. A 1 °C rise in summertime soil temperature caused 44% and 78% increases in CO2 efflux and CH4 consumption, respectively, and a 32% increase in the frequency of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Bacterial alpha diversity was unaffected by the treatments, but, of the 40 most frequent bacterial taxa, warming caused 44–45% reductions in the relative abundances of a Sphingomonas sp. and Ferruginibacter sp. and 33–91% increases in those of a Phenylobacterium sp. and a member of the Acetobacteraceae. Warming did not influence the frequency of fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 copies, and irrigation had no effects on the measured variables. Our study suggests rapid changes to the activities and abundances of microbes, and particularly bacteria, in High Arctic patterned ground soils as they warm. At current rates of soil warming on Svalbard (0.8 °C per decade), we anticipate that similar effects to those reported here will manifest themselves in the natural environment by approximately the mid 2030s. © 2022 by the authors.},

The macro- and micro-morphology of the isolate was studied together with partial sequences of the DNA regions ITS, LSU, TEF1, and β-TUB, as well as the optimal values for temperature, pH and salinity. Slight differences between our two isolates and previously known strains of P. antarcticus were found in morphology (colony color and shape, size of phialides and spores) and physiological traits (optimal growth temperature, range of acceptable temperature and pH values for growth, colony odor, and degree of mucosity under extreme conditions). However, the high similarity in the sequenced conservative DNA sequences from 100 to 97% indicates that these slight morphological and physiological variations of the studied strains of P. antarcticus are intraspecific variation.

  abstract={In this study, biocatalysts in the form of mycelium-bound lipases of psychrotrophic and mesophilic fungi were screened for their ability to synthesize fatty acid methyl (FAME) and ethyl esters (FAEE). It has been shown that the hydrolytic activity of biocatalysts is not accompanied by their biodiesel synthetic activity. Preliminary studies showed for the first time, that the FTIR technique can be used to predict synthetic activity. The highest correlation between the intensity of the bands and synthetic activity, negative and positive, respectively, was observed for two neighboring bands at 1745 cm−1 (R = −0.73) and 1699 cm−1 (R = 0.68). The psychrotrophic strain Penicillium sp. 59, isolated from the soil of the Arctic tundra (Spitsbergen), has been shown for the first time as an efficient whole-cell biocatalyst for fatty acid ethyl ester synthesis and is stable in organic solvents. Mathematical optimization of biosynthesis was also performed using RSM. A molar canola oil conversion value of 83.3% into FAEE was obtained at 24.2 °C in n-hexane using 7.6% of used canola oil and 5.3% of the fungal biocatalyst within 6 h. Dry mycelium of Penicillium sp. 59 is a promising new biocatalyst for large-scale biosynthesis of biodiesel, given its low-cost production, high activity at room temperature, no need to mix reactions, and reusability in a minimum of six cycles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Glacier retreat in cold regions exposes new terrain for plant colonization. However, the roles of soil microbiomes in plant establishment and performance on newly-exposed forefields have rarely been assessed. Here, we compared the survival of Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) individuals grown for three years in sterilised and unsterilised soils at sites initially at 30 m, 100 m and 300 m from three retreating Maritime Antarctic glaciers. We also installed open top chambers (OTCs), which increased air temperatures by ∼1.8 °C and reduced soil water potential by ≤ 4 kPa, on one forefield to test the effects of warming on C. quitensis survival and the soil microbiome. The main driver of plant performance was distance from glacier fronts, with a 32 kPa reduction in soil water potential apparently explaining reduced plant survival at 300m compared with 30 m from glaciers. Soil sterilisation had few effects on plant survival at 30 m and 100 m, but reduced survival at 300 m, which was attributable to reductions in beneficial plant-microbial interactions. Effects of OTCs on plant survival were amplified with distance from glacier and sterilisation, with plants not surviving in chambered and sterilised soil at 300 m after three years. Soil bacterial functionality altered from a phototrophic community at 30 m to a more specialized chemoheterotrophic community at 100–300 m. Fungal ortholog groups showed transfer RNA and ribosome biogenesis to be enriched in soil at 30 m, with spliceosomes and messenger RNA synthesis being more frequent at 300 m. We propose that soil microbiomes improve the environmental tolerance of C. quitensis through enhanced physiological performance, which in turn improves survival and facilitates the species’ colonization of newly-exposed glacier forefield soils. These plant-microbe interactions are likely to become increasingly important as the climate of Maritime Antarctica changes over future decades. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Introduction: In the extremely dry and oligotrophic soils of East Antarctica, where low temperatures and humidity result in minimal biological turnover rates, extracellular DNA (eDNA) can persist over extended timescales. Differentiating between sequences from living, potentially active cells (intracellular DNA, or iDNA) and those from ancient, non-living organisms (eDNA) is crucial for accurately assessing the current microbial community and understanding historical microbial dynamics. Methods: This study was conducted along a chronosequence in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, where soil samples were collected from sites at varying distances from the glacier. By employing DNA separation methods, we distinguished iDNA, which represents living cells, from eDNA derived from dead organisms. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize bacterial and eukaryotic communities across different successional stages. Results: The DNA separation approach revealed distinct bacterial and eukaryotic community structures along the glacier transect. Actinobacteria were consistently abundant across all sites, while other phyla such as Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria thrived in extreme, nutrient-poor environments. Early successional stages were characterized by the simultaneous colonization of green algae Trebouxiophyceae and cryophilic fungi, alongside nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which contributed to initial soil development. The study also identified three distinct modes of microbial distribution, reflecting varying degrees of activity and adaptability. Discussion: Our findings provide new insights into microbial dynamics in extreme habitats and propose new hypotheses for microbial colonization in newly exposed soils. Moreover, they contribute to the ongoing debate in microbial ecology regarding the viability of dormant or dead cells and emphasize the need for refining DNA-based methods and exploring functional pathways to deepen our understanding of microbial succession in polar regions.

  abstract={Deception Island is well-known for harboring highly diverse microbial communities due to its unique volcanic environment in Antarctica. Most studies focused on bacteria, and relatively little was known about the fungal species on this island. The present study was aimed to determine the antimicrobial production and nutrient utilization profiles of a soil fungus from Deception Island, designated as Im33. Our findings showed that the strain had maximum mycelial growth and sporulation on malt-extract agar (MEA) medium, but it demonstrated the strongest antimicrobial activity in yeast extract-malt extract broth (YMB) medium. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 regions showed that it is a species belonging to the genus Talaromyces. It was resistant to cycloheximide concentrations up to 1,000 mg/L and exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative test pathogens, as well as being able to utilize a variety of carbon sources. This is the first report of a Talaromyces species from Deception Island. The capability of the strain to produce broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds and various enzymes indicated that Antarctic fungi, like their bacterial counterparts, have adopted various adaptation strategies to compete and survive in the extreme environment. © 2023 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

  abstract={Prasiola is a genus of foliose green algae that forms extensive cryptogamic canopies that contribute to the greening of ice-free areas in the Antarctic tundra. To better understand the impact of Prasiola canopy establishment on colonization in these areas, this study compared the taxonomic and functional structures of bacterial and fungal communities in adjacent soils with and without extensive Prasiola colonization. DNA metabarcoding was employed to analyze the microbial community structure in these soils and in the canopy. Additionally, a phylogenetic study of Prasiola samples was conducted to characterize the taxonomic composition of the analyzed canopies, revealing the presence of Prasiola crispa (Lightfoot) Kützing and P. antarctica Kützing. Key soil attributes were assessed to examine the canopy’s influence. Higher pH and carbon, nitrogen, and organic matter contents were found in Prasiola-covered soils than in bare soils. Furthermore, Prasiola canopy establishment not only influenced abiotic soil properties but also shaped soil microbial community structure and its functions. For instance, while Actinobacteriota predominated in bacterial communities both within the Prasiola canopy and beneath it, Bacteroidota dominated in the bare soil. Despite significant variability across soil types, fungal communities showed a trend of higher abundances in certain Ascomycetes, such as Helotiales, Hypocreales, or Xylariales, in soils beneath Prasiola compared to bare soils. Regarding functional diversity, covered soils exhibited a statistically significant lower potential for bacterial methanogenesis and autotrophic CO2 fixation compared to bare soils. Finally, lichenized fungi, plant pathogens, and fungal wood saprotrophs tended to be more abundant in covered soils. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={Plant pathogens cause great economic losses in agriculture. To reduce damage, chemical pesticides have been frequently used, but these compounds in addition to causing risks to the environment and health, its continuous use has given rise to resistant phytopathogens, threatening the efficiency of control methods. One alternative for such a problem is the use of natural products with high antifungal activity and low toxicity. Here, we present the production, isolation, and identification of cyclopaldic acid, a bioactive compound produced by Penicillium sp. CRM 1540, a fungal strain isolated from Antarctic marine sediment. The crude extract was fractionated by reversed-phase chromatography and yielded 40 fractions, from which fraction F17 was selected. We used 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis in DMSO-d6 and CDCl3, together with mass spectrometry, to identify the compound as cyclopaldic acid C11H10O6 (238 Da). The pure compound was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against phytopathogenic fungi of global agricultural importance, namely: Macrophomina phaseolina, Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The antifungal assay revealed the potential of cyclopaldic acid, produced by Penicillium sp. CRM 1540, as a leading molecule against M. phaseolina and R. solani, with more than 90% of growth inhibition after 96h of contact with the fungal cells using 100 µg mL−1, and more than 70% using 50 µg mL−1. © 2023, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

  abstract={Microbiomes are crucial for the health, physiology, and environmental adaptation of marine multicellular organisms. In Antarctica, marine invertebrates have developed unique physiological functions and adaptive strategies to withstand extremely cold and unstable conditions. However, diversity and role of the microbiome of Antarctic mollusks remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the diversity, and the putative functional role of the microbiome of the proboscis of the whelk Neobuccinum eatoni, one of the endemic species that dominate the Antarctic benthic ecosystems. We compared the microbiomes of both juveniles and adults and female and male specimens to understand potential changes across different life stages and the sex of the host. In addition, we investigated the microbiome of N. eatoni’s habitat to explore possible transmission pathways between host and environment. Results showed the presence of a microbiome core shared among all the individuals of N. eatoni, which remained stable across different life stages and sexes, accounting, on average, for up to 91% of the total microbiome. The core was mostly represented by bacterial members belonging to the genera Sulfurospirillum, Mycoplasma, and Polaribacter. These bacteria are characterized by putative metabolic functions specialized in chemoheterotrophy and the reduction of sulfur compounds, thus supporting N. eatoni in the degradation/digestion processes of even the most refractory food sources. In addition, the absence of these bacteria in the sediments of the surrounding environment suggests a vertical transmission of the microbiome through the whelk generations. These findings expand knowledge of the diversity and key role of the microbiome in Antarctic invertebrates providing insights into the microbiome contribution to holobiont survival to polar environments. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={The ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are dominated by nutrient-poor mineral soil and rocky outcrops. The principal habitat for microorganisms is within rocks (endolithic). In this environment, microorganisms are provided with protection against sub-zero temperatures, rapid thermal fluctuations, extreme dryness, and ultraviolet and solar radiation. Endolithic communities include lichen, algae, fungi, and a diverse array of bacteria. Chloroflexota is among the most abundant bacterial phyla present in these communities. Among the Chloroflexota are four novel classes of bacteria, here named Candidatus Spiritibacteria class. nov. (=UBA5177), Candidatus Martimicrobia class. nov. (=UBA4733), Candidatus Tarhunnaeia class. nov. (=UBA6077), and Candidatus Uliximicrobia class. nov. (=UBA2235). We retrieved 17 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that represent these four classes. Based on genome predictions, all these bacteria are inferred to be aerobic heterotrophs that encode enzymes for the catabolism of diverse sugars. These and other organic substrates are likely derived from lichen, algae, and fungi, as metabolites (including photosynthate), cell wall components, and extracellular matrix components. The majority of MAGs encode the capacity for trace gas oxidation using high-affinity uptake hydrogenases, which could provide energy and metabolic water required for survival and persistence. Furthermore, some MAGs encode the capacity to couple the energy generated from H2 and CO oxidation to support carbon fixation (atmospheric chemosynthesis). All encode mechanisms for the detoxification and efflux of heavy metals. Certain MAGs encode features that indicate possible interactions with other organisms, such as Tc-type toxin complexes, hemolysins, and macroglobulins. IMPORTANCE The ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the coldest and most hyperarid desert on Earth. It is, therefore, the closest analog to the surface of the planet Mars. Bacteria and other microorganisms survive by inhabiting airspaces within rocks (endolithic). We identify four novel classes of phylum Chloroflexota, and, based on interrogation of 17 metagenome-assembled genomes, we predict specific metabolic and physiological adaptations that facilitate the survival of these bacteria in this harsh environment—including oxidation of trace gases and the utilization of nutrients (including sugars) derived from lichen, algae, and fungi. We propose that such adaptations allow these endolithic bacteria to eke out an existence in this cold and extremely dry habitat. © 2024 American Society for Microbiology. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Utilization of industrial side streams as nutrient source for cellular agriculture is a promising option to improve the sustainability of the production processes. The aim of the study was to evaluate usability of two liquid food industry side streams, potato cell fluid and acid whey, as nutrient source for production of food ingredients with plant cell cultures (arctic bramble (Rubus arcticus L.) and tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum L.)) and filamentous fungi (Paecilomyces variotii, Rhizopus oligosporus and Trichoderma reesei). The side streams were found to contain various sugars and other potential nutrients suitable for the studied organisms. The side streams were used as a sole nutrient source (fungi) or as a replacement of selected nutrients in the growth media (fungi and plant cells) in flask scale cultivations. Acid whey was successfully used as a growth medium for filamentous fungi, but it inhibited plant cell growth presumably due to high organic acid content (14 g/l). Potato side stream was found suitable as a fungal and plant cell growth media supplement, and it was used together with glucose for filamentous fungi, or as a partial replacer of macronutrients for plant cells, in bioreactor cultivations yielding high fungal (up to 36 g/l dry weight) and good plant cell (9.5 g/l dry weight) biomass production. Analyses of the produced biomasses revealed good nutritional value in terms of amino acid (17–27 % of dry matter) and dietary fiber (23–30 % of dry matter) contents, giving good premises for utilization in human nutrition. © 2024 The Authors},

  abstract={Climate change predictions suggest that arctic and subarctic ecosystems will be particularly affected by rising temperatures and extreme weather events, including severe heat waves. Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors controlling and regulating microbial decomposition in soils; therefore, it is critical to understand its impact on soil microorganisms and their feedback to climate warming. We conducted a warming experiment in a subarctic birch forest in North Sweden to test the effects of summer heat waves on the thermal trait distributions that define the temperature dependences for microbial growth and respiration. We also determined the microbial temperature dependences 10 and 12 months after the heat wave simulation had ended to investigate the persistence of the thermal trait shifts. As a result of warming, the bacterial growth temperature dependence shifted to become warm-adapted, with a similar trend for fungal growth. For respiration, there was no shift in the temperature dependence. The shifts in thermal traits were not accompanied by changes in α- or β-diversity of the microbial community. Warming increased the fungal-to-bacterial growth ratio by 33% and decreased the microbial carbon use efficiency by 35%, and both these effects were caused by the reduction in moisture the warming treatments caused, while there was no evidence that substrate depletion had altered microbial processes. The warm-shifted bacterial thermal traits were partially restored within one winter but only fully recovered to match ambient conditions after 1 year. To conclude, a summer heat wave in the Subarctic resulted in (i) shifts in microbial thermal trait distributions; (ii) lower microbial process rates caused by decreased moisture, not substrate depletion; and (iii) no detectable link between the microbial thermal trait shifts and community composition changes. © 2023 The Authors.

Here, soil samples were collected from permafrost (P), moraine (M) and Deschampsia antarctica rhizosphere (R) soils near Ecology Glacier (Antarctic), and their soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities (bacteria, archaea and fungi) were characterized. Our analyses showed that there were significant differences in the soil properties and microbial communities between the R samples and the P and M samples. Specifically, amplicon sequencing of 16S rDNA revealed high bacterial richness and diversity in the studied soils, which were dominated mainly by the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota and Bacteroidota. In contrast, lower richness and diversity were observed in the archaeal communities, which were dominated by the phyla Chenarchaeota (M and R) and Thermoplasmadota (M). In addition, fungal community analysis revealed a lower richness and diversity (M and R), dominated by the phylum Ascomycota. Our observations are consistent with previous reports describing the relevant changes in soil microbial communities during glacial recession, including fewer microbial groups studied in soils (archaea and fungi).

  abstract={The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool of the Arctic region is currently protected by low temperatures, but is likely to decrease due to greater organic matter (OM) decomposition under a warmer climate. Negative feedback for climate warming can, however, be reversed by SOC accrual as climate warming leads to shifts in arctic vegetation (from grass to shrub) and soil faunal (introduction of macrofauna) communities affecting plant-soil C allocation. To decipher these contrasting effects, we performed a laboratory experiment with soils from dry tundra to test the interacting effects of plant litter quality (high-quality grass litter vs. the intermediate- and low-quality litter of shrubs) and soil fauna functional grouping (micro-, meso- and macrofauna [millipede]) on the processes of litter decomposition and OM stabilization. Our findings showed that macrofauna largely promoted decomposition of shrub litter, while soil micro- and mesofauna were mainly responsible for the decomposition of grass litter. Our study thus confirmed that, when introduced and established in a warmer Arctic, macrofauna may become an important agent in shrub litter decomposition. Our data also showed that with shrub litter, higher C content was stabilized as particulate OM (POM) in aggregates, whereas in grass litter and low-quality shrub litter, higher C content was stabilized as mineral-associated OM (MAOM). Both these effects were larger in the presence of macrofauna and with a higher abundance of fungi. This suggests that consequent shrub OM stabilization in occluded POM and MAOM fractions will be carried out jointly by macrofauna and fungi, which will probably lead to more efficient OM stabilization in Arctic soils than in the case of grass litter OM stabilization by micro- and mesofauna and bacteria. In conclusion, our study suggests that vegetation changes and the introduction of macrofauna in a warming climate will most probably lead to higher OM stabilization in Arctic soils. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Despite the important role that biocrust communities play in maintaining ecosystem structure and functioning in deglaciated barren soil, few studies have been conducted on the dynamics of biotic communities and the impact of physicochemical characteristics in shaping the different successional stages. In this study an integrated approach encompassing physicochemical parameters and molecular taxonomy was used for identifying the indicator taxa and the presence of intra- and inter-kingdom interactions in five different crust/biocrust successional stages: i) physical crust, ii) cyanobacteria-dominated biocrust, iii) cyanobacteria/moss-dominated biocrust, iv) moss-dominated biocrust and v) bryophyte carpet. The phylum Gemmatimonadota was the bacterial indicator taxon in the early stage, promoting both inter- and intra-kingdom interactions, while Cyanobacteria and Nematoda phyla played a pivotal role in formation and dynamics of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts. A multitrophic community, characterized by a shift from oligotrophic to copiotrophic bacteria and the presence of saproxylic arthropod and herbivore insects was found in the cyanobacteria/moss-dominated biocrust, while a more complex biota, characterized by an increased fungal abundance (classes Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Dothideomycetes, phylum Ascomycota), associated with highly trophic consumer invertebrates (phyla Arthropoda, Rotifera, Tardigrada), was observed in moss-dominated biocrusts. The class Bdelloidea and the family Hypsibiidae (phyla Rotifera and Tardigrada, respectively) were metazoan indicator taxon in bryophyte carpet, suggesting their potential role in shaping structure and function of this late successional stage. Nitrogen and phosphorus were the main physicochemical limiting factors driving the shift among different crust/biocrust successional stages. Identification and characterization of indicator taxa, biological intra- and inter-kingdom interactions and abiotic factors driving the shift among different crust/biocrust successional stages provide a detailed picture on crust/biocrust dynamics, revealing a strong interconnection among micro- and macrobiota systems. These findings enhance our understanding of biocrust ecosystems in High Arctic, providing valuable insights for their conservation and management in response to environmental shifts due to climate change. © 2024 The Authors},

  abstract={Aims: Citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri) is a disease of economic importance. Control of this disease includes the use of metallic copper, which is harmful to the environment and human health. Previous studies showed that the crude extract from the fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. LAMAI 2784 isolated from Antarctic soil had in vitro antibacterial action against X. citri. The aim of the present study was to expand the applications of this extract. Methods and results: In greenhouse assays, the crude extract was able to reduce bacterial infection on citrus leaves from 1.55 lesions/cm2 (untreated plants) to 0.04 lesions/cm2. Bisdechlorogeodin was identified as the main compound of the bioactive fraction produced by Pseudogymnoascus sp. LAMAI 2784, which inhibited bacterial growth in vitro (IC90 ≈ 156 μg ml−1) and permeated 80% of X. citri cells, indicating that the membrane is the primary target. Conclusion: The present results showed that the bioactive fraction of the extract is mainly composed of the compound bisdechlorogeodin, which is likely responsible for the biological activity against X. citri, and the main mechanism of action is the targeting of the cell membrane. This study indicates that bisdechlorogeodin has valuable potential for the control of X. citri. © The Author(s) 2024.

  abstract={The quantity of industrially polluted waters is increasing everywhere, of which a significant part is occupied by a number of mono- and poly-aromatic compounds. Toxins enter the soil, sewage, and clean water by mixing with or seeping into them from industrial wastewater. By using 18S RNA and ITS sequences, the Penicillium commune AL5 strain that was isolated from Antarctic soil was identified. This study is dedicated to exploring its capacity to metabolize hazardous aromatic compounds. The strain showed very good potential in the degradation of hydroxylated monophenols and possessed exceptional abilities in terms of resorcinol degradation. The strain’s ability to metabolize 0.3 g/L of p-cresol at 10 °C is notable. The strain is also capable of metabolizing LMW PAHs (naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene) and eliminating all three tested compounds under 23 °C, respectively, 77.5%, 93.8%, and 75.1%. At 10 °C, the process slowed down, but the degradation of naphthalene continued to be over 50%. The quantity of PAH and a few significant intermediary metabolites were determined using GC–MS analysis. Sequencing of the enzymes phenol hydroxylase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase revealed a close association with the genes and proteins in some fungal strains that can degrade the aromatic compounds examined thus far. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Introduction: Phytopathogenic fungi are a considerable concern for agriculture, as they can threaten the productivity of several crops worldwide. Meanwhile, natural microbial products are acknowledged to play an important role in modern agriculture as they comprehend a safer alternative to synthetic pesticides. Bacterial strains from underexplored environments are a promising source of bioactive metabolites. Methods: We applied the OSMAC (One Strain, Many Compounds) cultivation approach, in vitro bioassays, and metabolo-genomics analyses to investigate the biochemical potential of Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b, a strain isolated from Antarctica. Crude extracts from OSMAC were analyzed through HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, molecular networking, and annotation. The antifungal potential of the extracts was confirmed against Rhizoctonia solani strains. Moreover, the whole-genome sequence was studied for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identification and phylogenetic comparison. Results and Discussion: Molecular networking revealed that metabolite synthesis has growth media specificity, and it was reflected in bioassays results against R. solani. Bananamides, rhamnolipids, and butenolides-like molecules were annotated from the metabolome, and chemical novelty was also suggested by several unidentified compounds. Additionally, genome mining confirmed a wide variety of BGCs present in this strain, with low to no similarity with known molecules. An NRPS-encoding BGC was identified as responsible for producing the banamides-like molecules, while phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship with other rhizosphere bacteria. Therefore, by combining -omics approaches and in vitro bioassays, our study demonstrates that Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b has potential application to agriculture as a source of bioactive metabolites.

  abstract={Soil fungi are pivotal in alpine and arctic ecosystems that are vulnerable to climate changes. Previous studies have shown broad connections between soil fungi in the arctic and alpine regions, but most of these studies are mainly from Europe and North America, with more sporadic studies from East Asia. Currently, little is known about the biogeographic relationships between soil fungi in alpine meadows of southwestern China (AMSC) and other regions of the world. In addition, the regional-scale spatial patterns of fungal communities in the AMSC, as well as their driving factors and ecological processes, are also poorly understood. In this study, we collected roots and surrounding soils of two dominant ectomycorrhizal plants, Bistorta vivipara and B. macrophylla from the AMSC, and performed bioinformatic and statistical analyses based on high-throughput sequencing of ITS2 amplicons. We found that: (1) fungi from the AMSC were closely related with those from boreal forests and tundra, and saprotrophic fungi had higher dispersal potential than ectomycorrhizal fungi; (2) community compositions exhibited clear divergences among geographic regions and between root and soil samples; (3) climate was the predominant factor driving regional-scale spatial patterns but had less explanatory power for saprotrophic and total fungi from roots than those from soils; (4) homogeneous selection and drift were the key ecological processes governing community assembly, but in communities of saprotrophic and total fungi from soil samples, drift contributed less and its role was partially replaced by dispersal limitation. This study highlights the importance of climatic selection and stochastic processes on fungal community assembly in alpine regions, and emphasizes the significance of simultaneously investigating fungi with different trophic modes and from both roots and soils. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Societal Impact Statement: Climate change is predicted to increase drought and soil salinity in Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), posing a significant threat to global food security. Genetic modification of crops to counteract this threat is expensive and has not met with universal support, and alternatives are hence needed to enhance crop production in MTEs. Here, fungal endophytes from the Atacama Desert, High Andes and Antarctica inoculated onto three crops were found to alleviate the negative effects of drought and salinity on plant performance. The study concludes that extremophile endophytes might be used to enhance crop performance as the climate of MTEs changes over future decades. Summary: Climate change will curtail the ability to provide sufficient food for our rapidly expanding population. Improvements to crop production in changing environments, particularly Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), which are increasingly subjected to drought and salinisation, are hence urgently needed. Here, we explored the possibility that fungal endophytes from extreme environments can be used to enhance crop yield, survival and tolerance to environmental stresses. Plants of lettuce, tomato and bell pepper were inoculated with up to six species of endophytic fungi isolated from the Atacama Desert, the High Andes and Antarctica. They were then exposed in the field for up to 120 days in each of three summers to current climatic conditions or to a future climate scenario simulating increased drought and soil salinisation. Compared with uninoculated plants, the yield and survival of inoculated crops were increased by up to two-fold under the future climate scenario. These effects were in part attributable to the improved water balance of inoculated crops exposed to drought and salinisation. The inocula also increased the concentrations of total phenols and proline in leaves and decreased lipid peroxidation when plants were subjected to increased aridity and salinity. A mixed inoculum of six endophytes from the extreme environments conferred the most beneficial effects on crop performance, with a commercially available inoculum having fewer positive effects on crops. We conclude that the inoculation of crops with endophytes from extreme environments may be a viable solution to sustaining crop production in MTEs exposed to rapid climate change. © 2023 The Authors.

  abstract={The majority of islands surrounding the Antarctic continent are poorly characterized in terms of microbial macroecology due to their remote locations, geographical isolation and access difficulties. The 2016/2017 Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) provided unprecedented access to a number of these islands. In the present study we use metagenomic methods to investigate the microbial ecology of soil samples recovered from 11 circum-Antarctic islands as part of ACE, and to investigate the functional potential of their soil microbial communities. Comparisons of the prokaryote and lower eukaryote phylogenetic compositions of the soil communities indicated that the various islands harbored spatially distinct microbiomes with limited overlap. In particular, we identified a high prevalence of lichen-associated fungal taxa in the soils, suggesting that terrestrial lichens may be one of the key drivers of soil microbial ecology on these islands. Differential abundance and redundancy analyses suggested that these soil microbial communities are also strongly shaped by multiple abiotic factors, including soil pH and average annual temperatures. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the islands sampled in this study can be clustered into three distinct large-scale biogeographical regions in a conservation context, the sub-, Maritime and Continental Antarctic, which are distinct in both environmental conditions and microbial ecology, but are consistent with the widely-used regionalization applied to multicellular Antarctic terrestrial organisms. Functional profiling of the island soil metagenomes from these three broad biogeographical regions also suggested a degree of functional differentiation, reflecting their distinct microbial ecologies. Taken together, these results represent the most extensive characterization of the microbial ecology of Antarctic island soils to date. © 2023 The Authors.

Here, we conduct a chronosequence study on the Ardley Island coastal terrace of the Fildes Peninsula, Maritime Antarctica. The results revealed that prokaryotic microorganism communities changed orderly among the six successional stages. Some marine microbial groups could still be found in near-coastal soils of the late stage (lowest stratum). Animal pathogenic bacteria and stress-resistant microorganisms occurred at the greatest level with the longest succession period. The main driving factors for the succession of bacteria, archaea, and fungi along Ardley Island terrace were found through Adonis analysis (PERMANOVA). During analysis, soil elements Mg, Si, and Na were related to the bacterial and archaeal community structure discrepancies, while Al, Ti, K, and Cl were related to the fungal community structure discrepancies. On the other hand, other environmental factors also play an important role in the succession of microbial communities, which could be different among each microorganism. The succession of bacterial communities is greatly affected by pH and water content; archaeal communities are greatly affected by (Formula presented.) ; fungal communities are affected by nutrients such as (Formula presented.). In the analysis of the characteristic microorganisms along terrace, the succession of microorganisms was found to be influenced by complex and comprehensive factors. For instance, environmental instability, relationship with plants and ecological niches, and environmental tolerance. The results found that budding reproduction and/or with filamentous appendages bacteria were enriched in the late stage, which might be connected to its tolerance to rapid changes and barren environments. In addition, the decline in ammonia oxidation capacity of Thaumarchaeota archaeade with succession and the evolution of the fungi-plant relationship throughout classes were revealed. Overall, this research improves the understanding of the effect of the marine–to–terrestrial transition of the Ardley Island terrace on microbial communities. These findings will lay the foundation for more in-depth research regarding microbial adaptations and evolutionary mechanisms throughout the marine–terrestrial transition in the future.

  abstract={Aims: Biocrusts, communities dominated by mosses, lichens, cyanobacteria, algae, and fungi living on the soil surface, constitute a vital biotic component of dryland ecosystems that play critical roles in maintaining their structure and functioning. However, there are substantial knowledge gaps regarding the global distribution of biocrusts, which has primarily been estimated using statistical methods. Given that water is a key limiting factor for dryland biota, it holds significant potential as a key driver of the global distribution of biocrusts. Methods: Here we utilized a novel global biocrust dataset comprising 2348 data points from six continents (excluding Antarctica) and adapted an existing ecohydrological model to predict biocrust cover across global drylands. Results: We found that in the regions with sufficient data, such as the Loess Plateau in China, the ecohydrological model reached good correlation coefficients between the simulated and observed biocrust cover (average correlation coefficient of 100 simulations was 0.727, with a corresponding RMSE of 0.311). However, at a global scale the model was unable to reproduce observed biocrust cover (correlation coefficient < 0.352, RMSE > 0.331). The high variability observed in biocrust cover globally may contribute to the low performance of the model at this scale. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that ecohydrological models show promise to map biocrust distribution at the regional scale when accompanied with region-specific detailed information about biocrusts and improved environmental data. They also provide a stepping-stone for future research to advance towards a mechanism-based prediction of global biocrust distribution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

The new species is sister to P. catalonicum, and was isolated from soil collected from Robinson Ridge, East Antarctica, following enrichment cultivation under oligotrophic conditions supplemented with excess hydrogen gas. Penicillium psychrofluorescens is named for its intense autofluorescence derived from a combination of compounds that may include NADPH, porphyrins, and secondary metabolites, such as polyketides. Comparative genomics with both Antarctic and mesophilic Penicillium spp. shows that Penicillium psychrofluorescens has a wide repertoire of glycoside hydrolases, but almost no polysaccharide lyases, has comparably large effector proteins, lacks the machinery to use nitrate as an N-source, but has the genes for the assimilation of phosphorus from phosphonates via oxidative pathway. The strain was found to have 30 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), the majority of which were unrelated to known compound BGCs. Given the remarkable diversity of natural products already characterised from Penicillium spp. and the presence of >30 BGCs with low similarity to known genes, there is biotechnological potential within this novel species that is yet to be explored. © 2024 The Author(s).

  abstract={Microplastics have emerged as a pervasive marine contaminant, with extreme concentrations reported in deep-sea sediments (e.g., 1.9 million particles/m2) and localized accumulations near Antarctic research stations. Particular concern has been raised regarding their synergistic effects with co-occurring antibiotics, which may potentiate toxicity and facilitate antibiotic resistance gene dissemination through microbial colonization of plastic surfaces. To investigate these interactions, a 185-day controlled exposure experiment was conducted using Aurelia aurita polyps. Factorial combinations of microplastics (0, 0.1, 1 mg/L) and tetracycline (0, 0.5, 5 mg/L) were employed to simulate environmentally relevant pollution scenarios. Microbiome alterations were characterized using metagenomic approaches. Analysis revealed that while alpha and beta diversity measures remained unaffected at environmental concentrations, significant shifts occurred in the relative abundance of dominant bacterial taxa, including Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota, and Mycoplasmatota. Metabolic pathway analysis demonstrated perturbations in key functional categories including cellular processes and environmental signal transduction. Furthermore, microplastic exposure was associated with modifications in polyp life-stage characteristics, suggesting potential implications for benthic–pelagic population dynamics. These findings provide evidence for the impacts of microplastic–antibiotic interactions on cnidarian holobionts, with ramifications for predicting jellyfish population responses in contaminated ecosystems. © 2025 by the authors.},

  abstract={Microorganisms that inhabit the cold Antarctic environment can produce ligninolytic enzymes potentially useful in bioremediation. Our study focused on characterizing Antarctic bacteria and fungi from marine sediment samples of King George and Deception Islands, maritime Antarctica, potentially affected by hydrocarbon influence, able to produce enzymes for use in bioremediation processes in environments impacted with petroleum derivatives. A total of 168 microorganism isolates were obtained: 56 from sediments of King George Island and 112 from Deception Island. Among them, five bacterial isolates were tolerant to cell growth in the presence of diesel oil and gasoline and seven fungal were able to discolor RBBR dye. In addition, 16 isolates (15 bacterial and one fungal) displayed enzymatic emulsifying activities. Two isolates were characterized taxonomically by showing better biotechnological results. Psychrobacter sp. BAD17 and Cladosporium sp. FAR18 showed pyrene tolerance (cell growth of 0.03 g mL−1 and 0.2 g mL−1) and laccase enzymatic activity (0.006 UL−1 and 0.10 UL−1), respectively. Our results indicate that bacteria and fungi living in sediments under potential effect of hydrocarbon pollution may represent a promising alternative to bioremediate cold environments contaminated with polluting compounds derived from petroleum such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dyes. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2023.},

  abstract={Microbial adaptations to extreme environments can lead to biotechnological applications. This study aimed to evaluate the resistance of Antarctic Cladosporium to adverse conditions (temperature, salinity, UV radiation, and nutrients) and refine their taxonomy. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis using ITS-act markers resulted in a more accurate taxonomic identification, revealing the presence of five different species, belonging to the complexes C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum. The growth at different temperatures indicates that the soil isolates LAMAI 564 and 1800 (phylogenetically closely related) and LAMAI 2541 are psychrophilic, while the other isolates are psychrotolerant. The fungi isolated from the saline samples LAMAI 595, 616, and 1369 showed better growth results at higher salinity (15%). The fungi most resistant to UV radiation were isolated from terrestrial and marine samples (LAMAI 595, 616, 1800, and 564). LAMAI 595 and 616 (phylogenetically closely related and isolated from the same kind of sample) showed the capacity of nutritional versatility, growing well in both rich and poor-nutrient media. The fungus LAMAI 595 was the most promising for biotechnological application, exceeding the other isolates in the harsh conditions studied. The resistance of the Antarctic Cladosporium to adverse conditions opens new perspectives in the field of applied microbiology of extremophiles. © 2024, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

  abstract={Climate warming is causing widespread deglaciation and pioneer soil formation over glacial deposits. Melting glaciers expose rocky terrain and glacial till sediment that is relatively low in biomass, oligotrophic, and depleted in nutrients. Following initial colonization by microorganisms, glacial till sediments accumulate organic carbon and nutrients over time. However, the mechanisms driving soil nutrient stabilization during early pedogenesis after glacial retreat remain unclear. Here, we traced amino acid uptake by microorganisms in recently deglaciated high-Arctic soils and show that fungi play a critical role in the initial stabilization of the assimilated carbon. Pioneer basidiomycete yeasts were among the predominant taxa responsible for carbon assimilation, which were associated with overall high amino acid use efficiency and reduced respiration. In intermediate- and late-stage soils, lichenized ascomycete fungi were prevalent, but bacteria increasingly dominated amino acid assimilation, with substantially decreased fungal:bacterial amino acid assimilation ratios and increased respiration. Together, these findings demonstrate that fungi are important drivers of pedogenesis in high-Arctic ecosystems that are currently subject to widespread deglaciation from global warming.

However, the lipid extraction method is still a bottleneck. The objective of the present work was to isolate and identify cultivable FF from Antarctic soils, to assess the most effective methods for fatty acid (FA) extraction, and to characterise the obtained lipids. A total of 18 fungal strains belonging to the Botrytis, Cladosporium, Cylindrobasidium, Mortierella, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, and Talaromyces genera and the Melanommataceae family were isolated and identified. The Folch, Bligh and Dyer, and Lewis extraction methods were assessed, and methyl esters of FA (FAMEs) were obtained. The Lewis method was the best in recovering FAMEs from fungal biomass. A total of 17 FAs were identified, and their chemical compositions varied depending on fungal species and strain. Oleic, linoleic, stearic, and palmitic acids were predominant for all fungal strains in the three assessed methods. Among the analysed strains, Cylindrobasidium eucalypti, Penicillium miczynskii, P. virgatum, and Pseudogymnoascus pannorum produced high amounts of FA. This suggests that the soils of Antarctica Bay, as well as harbouring known oleaginous fungi, are also an important source of oleaginous filamentous fungi that remain poorly analysed. © 2025 by the authors.},

  abstract={Abstract: In view of the high responsiveness of polar ecosystems to the global climate change, the research of Antarctic microorganisms has become a topical issue. The unique ecosystems that have developed under the severe climate conditions of the continent lack flowering plants but are dominated by soil mycobiota. In addition to performing their classical ecological functions, Antarctic fungi form the basis of local communities, e.g., endoliths and microbial mats. Furthermore, Antarctic fungi are a major force that mediates transformation of rock minerals in situ and makes biologically significant elements available for other organisms. For these reasons, mycobiota plays a central role in the maintenance of ecological equilibrium in Antarctica. The dominant fungal division on the continent is Ascomycota (77.1%), and not Basidiomycota (9.1%), as it is the case on other continents. For a number of reasons, yeasts and yeast-like micromycetes (mainly basidiomycetes) are more tolerant to extreme conditions in various Antarctic biotopes than filamentous fungi. Substantial evidence suggests that filamentous fungi and yeasts are better adapted to existence in ecosystems with extremely low temperatures than other microorganisms. Due to the long-term isolation of Antarctica from other continents, local biota has been evolving largely independently, which led to emergence of multiple endemic fungal taxa. The presence of eurytopes on the continent is presumably related to the global warming and growing anthropogenic pressure. This review discusses the current state of research on the structure of fungal communities of Antarctic subaerial and subaquatic biotopes, the ecological role of yeast–mycelial dimorphism in Antarctic fungi, the problem of endemism of Antarctic mycobiota, as well as the ecological and physiological adaptations of fungi to low temperatures; it also justifies the relevance of research into secondary metabolites of psychrophilic micromycetes. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

These two habitats impose different selection pressures on organisms, yet the possible filtering effects on the diversity and composition of microbial communities have not hitherto been fully characterised. We hence compared fungal communities in rocks and soils in three localities of inner Victoria Land. We found low fungal diversity in both substrates, with a mean species richness of 28 across all samples, and significantly lower diversity in rocks than in soils. Rock and soil communities were strongly differentiated, with a multinomial species classification method identifying just three out of 328 taxa as generalists with no affinity for either substrate. Rocks were characterised by a higher abundance of lichen-forming fungi (typically Buellia, Carbonea, Pleopsidium, Lecanora, and Lecidea), possibly owing to the more protected environment and the porosity of rocks permitting photosynthetic activity. In contrast, soils were dominated by obligate yeasts (typically Naganishia and Meyerozyma), the abundances of which were correlated with edaphic factors, and the black yeast Cryomyces. Our study suggests that strong differences in selection pressures may account for the wide divergences of fungal communities in rocks and soils of inner Victoria Land. © 2023 The Authors.

Due to their great adaptability to the environment, they have managed to colonize many terrestrial habitats, presenting a worldwide distribution from the poles to the tropical regions and from the plains to the highest mountains. In the flora of the Antarctic region, lichens stand out due to their variety and development and are a potential source of new bioactive compounds. Methods: A phytochemical study of the Antarctic lichen Usnea aurantiaco-atra (Jacq) Bory was conducted with the intention of determining the most important metabolites. In addition, the cytotoxic and antioxidant activities of its extracts were determined. Results: Cytotoxicity studies revealed that the hexane extract contains usnic acid as a majority metabolite, in addition to linoleic acid, ergosterols and terpenes, and demonstrates cytotoxic activity against an A375 melanoma cell line. On the other hand, the presence of total phenols in the extracts did not influence their antioxidant activity. Conclusions: U. aurantiaco-atra contains mainly usnic acid, although there are terpenes and ergosta compounds that could be responsible for its cytotoxic activity. The presence of phenols did not confer antioxidant properties. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Background: Although ice-free terrestrial ecosystems in Antarctica cover only limited areas, they harbor diverse and metabolically active microbial communities. These ecosystems encompass distinct microhabitats such as mosses, lichens, and soils, each offering unique ecological niches. However, how different microbial taxa respond to microhabitat heterogeneity, ecological strategies such as functional redundancy and specialization contribute to adaptation in extreme environments remains underexplored. To address these questions, we employed high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing in combination with GeoChip-based functional gene profiling to assess the structure and functional potential of microbial communities across moss, lichen and soil microhabitats in Antarctic ice-free terrestrial ecosystem. Results: Microhabitat type has a greater influence on microbial community structure and function in the ice-free Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem than geographical location. Though all prokaryotic communities were dominated by Pseudomonadota, Nostoc and Endobacter were significantly enriched in the moss and lichen microhabitats, respectively. Meanwhile, all fungal communities were primarily dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, with Byssoloma and Usnea showing significant enrichment in the moss and lichen microhabitats, respectively. Despite these taxonomic differences, the three microhabitats show similar core ecological functions with widespread microbial functional redundancy. Nevertheless, clear microhabitat-specific functional specialization was suggested. For example, moss microhabitat was enriched in Pyoverdin_pvcC and Zeaxanthin_glucosyltransferase, sdhA, lichen microhabitat harbored higher levels of nhaA, nikC, vacuolar_iron_transport, mttB, glucoamylase, pel_Cdeg, pme_Cdeg, rgh, rgl, while soil microhabitat was enriched in 5f1_ppn and isopullulanase. Notably, genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were significantly more abundant in moss and lichen microhabitats than in soil microhabitat, indicating the adaptive capacity of symbiotic microorganisms to mitigate ultraviolet radiation and oxidative stress to protect their hosts. Conclusions: Microbial communities associated with distinct microhabitats (i.e. mosses, lichens, and soils) in Antarctic ice-free terrestrial ecosystem exhibit both functional redundancy in core ecological functions and microhabitat-specific specialization in key microbial taxa and adaptive strategy. © The Author(s) 2025.},

  abstract={Colonization by pioneer plants, among which the arctic willow (Salix polaris) is one of the most important, accelerates soil development after deglaciation. This is achieved through the increased input of organic matter from plant biomass and the exudation of low molecular mass organic compounds (LMMOA), predominantly organic acids, which facilitate mineral dissolution and nutrient release. These exudates support microbial activity and contribute to the formation of soil organic matter. While there is quite a lot of data on the exudation and acceleration of microbial activity in the rhizosphere of various plants, similar data concerning arctic plants, including willow, are scarce. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the effect of C, N, P root stoichiometry on nutrient content in exudates and the rhizosphere microbiome during soil succession after deglaciation. In this study, we analysed various habitats of high-arctic tundra in Petuniabukta (Billefjorden, Svalbard), representing different stages of vegetation development. Our objectives were (i) to assess soil and rhizosphere carbon and nutrient content and availability, as well as microbial biomass CNP; (ii) to evaluate the rhizosphere effect on nutrient availability and the microbiome of arctic willow; and (iii) to measure root and exudation CNP and quality, primarily LMMOA, in arctic willow from the studied habitats. The exudates released to deionised water were analysed for LMMOA and inorganic anions (ion chromatography) as well as the total content of C and N. The plants roots were analysed for CNP content. Soil chemical properties (e.g. pH, organic C, total and exchangeable content of elements, water extractable PO43−) and microbial parameters (microbial biomass and quantity of bacteria and fungi) were assessed in both rhizosphere and bulk soils, with the rhizosphere effect calculated accordingly. The most abundant LMMOA species in willow exudates were lactate, acetate, formate, malate and citrate, followed by pyruvate, quinate and oxalate, collectively representing approximately 2% of the total exuded C. The rhizosphere effect of willows on nutrient availability and microbial parameters was the most significant at sites with early soil development and diminished with increasing vegetation cover. A link was observed between nitrogen and phosphorus exudation and plant root stoichiometry.

  abstract={Soil microorganisms regulate the decomposition of organic matter. However, microbial activities can also be rate-limited by the resource in lowest supply. Arctic ecosystems are being exposed to pronounced climate warming, with arctic greening, treeline advance and shrubification resulting in increased plant-derived carbon (C) inputs to soils, and faster rates of decomposition releasing mineral nutrients, potentially shifting the limiting factor for microbial growth. Here we used a “space-for-time” approach across a subarctic ecotone (birch forest, tree line, shrub and tundra sites). N and P fertilization treatments were also applied in the field, to test whether changes in resource limitation could be induced through nutrient loading of soils. In these soils, we measured the responses of bacterial and fungal growth as well as soil respiration to full factorial additions of C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (“limiting factor assays”: LFA) to infer how the limiting factor for microbial growth would be affected by future climate change. We found that bacteria were triple-limited by C, N and P, while fungi were co-limited by C and N, with no shift in the limiting factor for bacterial or fungal growth across the ecotone. However, bacterial responses to the LFA were stronger in the tundra, showing 9-fold stronger increases in response to LFA-CNP addition compared to that in the forest. In contrast, fungal responses to the LFA were stronger in the forest, showing a 120% higher growth in response to LFA-CN addition, with no detectable response to LFA-CN addition in the tundra. These contrasting results suggested competitive interactions for resources between the two decomposer groups. Fertilization in the field shifted the bacterial resource limitation, but had no effect on the limiting factor for fungal growth. Together, our findings suggest that resource limitations for soil microorganisms will not change due to future warming, but rather affect degrees of fungal-to-bacterial dominance. © 2022},

  abstract={Purpose: Pinaceae (pine family) trees are native to the Northern Hemisphere and their invasion into the Southern Hemisphere is a growing problem threatening biological diversity. Pinaceae are ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and their invasions are facilitated by non-native and co-invasive ECM fungi. Nothofagaceae species (southern beeches) are dominant overstory trees across large swaths of the Southern Hemisphere and are the only widespread ECM trees native to southern South America (SSA). This observational study investigates the in situ impact of Pinaceae invasions upon native soil fungi associated with Nothofagaceae hosts in SSA. Methods: We performed soil nutrient testing and metabarcode sequencing of fungi in the rhizosphere of Nothofagus antarctica and Nothofagus dombeyi invaded by Pinaceae trees to determine whether co-invasive fungi might impact native soil fungi. Sampling transects extended from invasions into adjacent Nothofagus stands without invasive Pinaceae. Results: The fungal community composition of the Nothofagaceae rhizosphere was dominated by plant-associated Mortierellaceae OTUs in metabarcode data. Mortierellaceae OTU relative abundance was significantly reduced near invasions of Pinus contorta (Pinaceae). Invasions of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Pinaceae) and Pinus contorta were associated with reduced relative abundance of Nothofagus-associated ECM OTUS in the Nothofagus rhizosphere. Pinus contorta invasions were also associated with reduced soil organic matter, total carbon, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen. Conclusion: Further empirical study is warranted to investigate the hypothesis that Mortierellaceae and Pinaceae-specific /suillus-rhizopogon ECM fungi compete for nutrients bound in soil organic matter. Such competition may have potential long-term legacy effects upon post-invasion restoration efforts and implications for Pinaceae invasions globally. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station area by the non-native grass Poa annua. This site was previously occupied only by native plants like the Antarctic hair grass Deschampsia antarctica. To adapt successfully to new conditions, plants interact with soil microorganisms, including fungi. The aim of this study was to determine how the newly introduced grass P. annua established an interaction with fungi compared to resident grass D. antarctica. We found that fungal diversity in D. antarctica roots was significantly higher compared with P. annua roots. D. antarctica managed a biodiverse microbiome because of its ability to recruit fungal biocontrol agents from the soil, thus maintaining a beneficial nature of the endophyte community. P. annua relied on a set of specific fungal taxa, which likely modulated its cold response, increasing its competitiveness in Antarctic conditions. Cultivated endophytic fungi displayed strong chitinolysis, pointing towards their role as phytopathogenic fungi, nematode, and insect antagonists.

  abstract={The relevance of the Arctic regions’ study is rapidly increasing due to the sensitive response of fragile ecosystems to climate change and anthropogenic pressure. The microbiome is an important component that determines the soils’ functioning and an indicator of changes occurring in ecosystems. Rybachy Peninsula is the northernmost part of the continental European Russia and is almost completely surrounded by Barents Sea water. For the first time, the microbial communities of the Entic Podzol, Albic Podzol, Rheic Histosol and Folic Histosol as well as anthropogenically disturbed soils (chemical pollution and human impact, growing crops) on the Rybachy Peninsula were characterized using plating and fluorescence microscopy methods, in parallel with the enzymatic activity of soils. The amount and structure of soil microbial biomass, such as the total biomass of fungi and prokaryote, the length and diameter of fungal and actinomycete mycelium, the proportion of spores and mycelium in the fungal biomass, the number of spores and prokaryotic cells, the proportion of small and large fungal spores and their morphology were determined. In the soils of the peninsula, the fungal biomass varied from 0.121 to 0.669 mg/g soil. The biomass of prokaryotes in soils ranged from 9.22 to 55.45 μg/g of soil. Fungi predominated, the proportion of which in the total microbial biomass varied from 78.5 to 97.7%. The number of culturable microfungi ranged from 0.53 to 13.93 × 103 CFU/g in the topsoil horizons, with a maximum in Entic Podzol and Albic Podzol soils and a minimum in anthropogenically disturbed soil. The number of culturable copiotrophic bacteria varied from 41.8 × 103 cells/g in a cryogenic spot to 5551.3 × 103 cells /g in anthropogenically disturbed soils. The number of culturable oligotrophic bacteria ranged from 77.9 to 12,059.6 × 103 cells/g. Changes in natural soils because of anthropogenic impact and a change in vegetation types have led to a change in the structure of the community of soil microorganisms. Investigated tundra soils had high enzymatic activity in native and anthropogenic conditions. The β-glucosidase and urease activity were comparable or even higher than in the soils of more southern natural zone, and the activity of dehydrogenase was 2–5 times lower. Thus, despite the subarctic climatic conditions, local soils have a significant biological activity upon which the productivity of ecosystems largely depends. The soils of the Rybachy Peninsula have a powerful enzyme pool due to the high adaptive potential of soil microorganisms to the extreme conditions of the Arctic, which allows them to perform their functions even under conditions of anthropogenic interference. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Arctic soils are constantly subjected to extreme environmental conditions such as low humidity, strong winds, high salinity, freeze-thaw cycles, UV exposition, and low nutrient availability, therefore, they have developed unique microbial ecosystems. These environments provide excellent opportunities to study microbial ecology and evolution within pristine (i.e. with limited anthropogenic influence) regions since the High Arctic is still considered one of the wildest and least explored environments on the planet. This environment is also of interest for the screening and recovery of unique microbial strains suitable for various biotechnological applications. In this study, a combination of culture-depended and culture-independent approaches was used to determine the cultivation bias in studies of the diversity of cold-active microorganisms. Cultivation bias is a reduction in recovered diversity, introduced when applying a classical culturing technique. Six different soil types, collected in the vicinity of the Polish Polar Station Hornsund (Spitsbergen, Norway), were tested. It was revealed that the used media allowed recovery of only 6.37 % of bacterial and 20 % of fungal genera when compared with a culture-independent approach. Moreover, it was shown that a combination of R2A and Marine Broth media recovered as much as 93.6 % of all cultivable bacterial genera detected in this study. Based on these results, a novel protocol for genome-guided bioprospecting, combining a culture-dependent approach, metabarcoding, next-generation sequencing, and genomic data reuse was developed. With this methodology, 14 psychrotolerant, multi-metal-resistant strains, including the highly promising Rhodococcus spp., were obtained. These strains, besides increased metal tolerance, have a petroleum hydrocarbon utilization capacity, and thus may be good candidates for future bioremediation technologies, also suited to permanently cold regions. © 2022 The Authors},

In the frame of the Lichens and Fungi Experiment, small fragments of Antarctic sandstones colonized by cryptoendolithic microbial communities were exposed to space and simulated martian conditions in low Earth orbit for 18 months, aboard the EXPOSE-E payload. Through the use of Raman and infrared spectroscopies, as well as a metabolomic approach, we aimed to detect organic compounds in a quartz mineral matrix. The results show that pigments, such as melanin, carotenoids, and chlorophyll, lipids, and amino acids, maintained their stability within minerals under simulated martian conditions in space, which makes them ideal biomarkers for the exploration of putative life on Mars.

In general, they displayed high diversity, richness and moderate dominance. Sequences representing saprophytic, pathogenic and symbiotic fungi were detected, including the phytopathogenic fungus D. anthuriicola that was abundant, in the relatively young Soto Lake on Deception Island. The lake sediments studied contained the DNA of rich, diverse and complex fungal communities, including both fungi commonly reported in Antarctica and other taxa considered to be rare.

  abstract={Ice-free areas are habitats for most of Antarctica’s terrestrial biodiversity. Although fungal communities are an important element of these habitats, knowledge of their assemblages and ecological functions is still limited. Herein, we investigated the diversity, composition, and ecological functionality of fungal communities inhabiting sediments from ice-free areas across pristine and anthropogenically impacted sites in the Fildes Peninsula on King George Island, Antarctica. Samples were collected from both pristine and disturbed areas. We used the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) region via Illumina sequencing of 34 sediment samples for fungal identification. The Ascomycota (14.6%) and Chytridiomycota (11.8%) were the most dominant phyla, followed by Basidiomycota (8.1%), Rozellomycota (7.0%), Mucoromycota (4.0%), while 34.9% of the fungal diversity remained unidentified. From a total of 1073 OTUs, 532 OTUs corresponded to 114 fungal taxa at the genus level, and 541 OTUs remained unassigned taxonomically. The highest diversity, with 18 genera, was detected at site A-3. At the genus level, there was no preference for either pristine or disturbed sites. The most widely distributed genera were Betamyces (Chytridiomycota), occurring in 29 of the 34 sites, and Thelebolus (Ascomycota), detected in 8 pristine sites and 7 disturbed sites. The Glomeraceae gen. incertae sedis was more common in disturbed sites. A total of 23 different ecological guilds were recorded, with the most abundant guilds being undefined saprotrophs, plant pathogens, plant saprotrophs, pollen saprotrophs, and endophytes. The fungal communities did not show significant differences between pristine and disturbed sites, suggesting that the anthropogenic impact is either not too intense or prolonged, that the spatial distance between the sampled sites is small, and/or that the environmental factors are similar. Although our study revealed a high fungal diversity with various ecological specializations within these communities, nearly one-third of the diversity could not be assigned to any specific taxonomic category. These findings highlight the need for further taxonomic research on fungal species inhabiting ice-free areas. Without identifying the species present, it is difficult to assess potential biodiversity loss due to environmental changes and/or human activities. © 2025 Garnica et al.

FAD33 showed potential antiproliferative action against human pancreatic carcinoma cells while showing no toxic effect on non-tumor cells. The microbial extracts from unidentified three bacteria and four filamentous fungi showed antibacterial activity against at least one tested pathogenic bacterial strain. The isolate FDG01 inhibited four bacterial species, while the isolate FDG01 was active against Micrococcus luteus in the minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.015625 μg mL −1. The results pave the way for further optimization of enzyme production and characterization of enzymes and metabolites found and reaffirm Antarctic marine environments as a wealthy source of compounds potentially applicable in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

  abstract={The use of yeasts has been explored as an efficient alternative to fungicide application in the treatment and prevention of post-harvest fruit deterioration. Here, we evaluated the biocontrol abilities of the Antarctic yeast strain Debaryomyces hansenii UFT8244 against the post-harvest phytopathogenic fungi Botrytis cinerea and Rhizopus stolonifer for the protection and preservation of strawberry fruit. The strongest inhibition of germination of B. cinerea (57%) was observed at 0 °C, followed by 40% at 25 °C. In addition, germ tubes and hyphae of B. cinerea were strongly surrounded and colonized by D. hansenii. Production of the enzymes β-1,3-glucanase, chitinase and protease by D. hansenii was detected in the presence of phytopathogenic fungus cell walls. The activity of β-1,3-glucanase was highest on day 12 of incubation and remained high until day 15. Chitinase and protease activities reached their highest levels on the day 15 of incubation. D. hansenii additionally demonstrated the ability to resist oxidative stress. Our data demonstrated that the main biocontrol mechanisms displayed by D. hansenii were the control of phytopathogenic fungal spore germination, production of antifungal enzymes and resistance to oxidative stress. We conclude that isolate D. hansenii UFT8422 should be further investigated for use at commercial scales at low temperatures. © 2024, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.},

The taxonomic affiliation of the isolated fungi was determined using polyphasic taxonomy. The isolated fungi belonged to 16 genera of different classes of ascomycetous, basidiomycetous, and zygomycetous fungi. The effect of cultivation temperature and different NaCl concentrations on fungal growth was determined, as well as the effect of cultivation conditions on the fatty acid profile for the strains capable of growth on media with increased osmotic potential.

  abstract={Fungi are increasingly recognised as being able to inhabit extreme environments. The deep sea is considered an extreme environment because of its low temperatures, high hydrostatic and lithostatic pressures, 3.5% salinity, and low oxygen, nutrient and light availability. Fungi inhabiting the deep sea may have evolved to produce proteins that allow them to survive these conditions. Investigation and characterisation of fungal lignocellulolytic enzymes from extreme environments like the deep sea is needed, as they may have unusual adaptations that would be useful in industry. This work, therefore, aimed to profile in detail the lignocellulolytic capabilities of fungi isolated from deep-sea sediments in the Atlantic Ocean, and a comparative lignocellulolytic terrestrial isolate. The isolates were strains of Emericellopsis maritima, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. antarcticum and Talaromyces stollii. Lignocellulolytic enzyme induction was achieved using liquid-state fermentation (LSF) with wheat bran as the main carbon source, while enzyme characteristics were evaluated using biochemical assays and gel-based proteomics. This study revealed that the isolates were halotolerant, produced xylanase over wide pH and temperature ranges, and produced a variety of glycoside hydrolase and feruloyl esterase activities. The T. stollii secretome demonstrated remarkable levels of exo-glycoside hydrolase activity, with xylanase activity optimum between pH 1.5–6.0 and temperatures between 1–60 °C, making this isolate an ideal candidate for biotechnological applications. This study is the first to quantitatively characterise xylanase activities and exo-glycoside hydrolase activities secreted by E. maritima, P. antarcticum and a marine T. stollii strain. This study is also the first to quantitatively characterise xylanase activities by a marine strain of P. chrysogenum during LSF. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={The degradation of biodegradable plastics poses a significant environmental challenge and requires effective solutions. In this study, an esterase derived from a phyllosphere yeast Pseudozyma antarctica (PaE) enhanced the degradation and mineralization of poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) film in soil. PaE was found to substitute for esterases from initial degraders and activate sequential esterase production from soil microbes. The PBSA film pretreated with PaE (PBSA-E) rapidly diminished and was mineralized in soil until day 55 with high CO2 production. Soil with PBSA-E maintained higher esterase activities with enhancement of microbial abundance, whereas soil with inactivated PaE-treated PBSA film (PBSA-inact E) showed gradual degradation and time-lagged esterase activity increases. The fungal genera Arthrobotrys and Tetracladium, as possible contributors to PBSA-film degradation, increased in abundance in soil with PBSA-inact E but were less abundant in soil with PBSA-E. The dominance of the fungal genus Fusarium and the bacterial genera Arthrobacter and Azotobacter in soil with PBSA-E further supported PBSA degradation. Our study highlights the potential of PaE in addressing concerns associated with biodegradable plastic persistence in agricultural and environmental contexts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

The prokaryotic community presented some peculiarities, such as the occurrence of sequences of Patescibacteria (which can thrive in nutrient-limited water environments) or few Spirochaeta, and the presence of archaeal sequences of Methanomicrobia closely related to Methanoculleus, a methanogen commonly detected in marine and estuarine environments. The high percentage (35%) of unassigned fungal taxa suggested the presence of a high degree of undiscovered diversity within a structured fungal community (including both yeast and filamentous life forms) and reinforce the hypothesis of a high degree of biological uniqueness of the habitat under study. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Cold-adapted microorganisms can produce enzymes with activity at low and mild temperatures, which can be applied to environmental biotechnology. This study aimed to characterize 20 Antarctic fungi to identify their genus (ITS rDNA marker) and growth temperatures and evaluate their ability to decolorize and detoxify the textile dye indigo carmine (IC). An individual screening was performed to assess the decolorization and detoxification of IC by the isolates, as well as in consortia with other fungi. The isolates were affiliated with seven ascomycete genera: Aspergillus (n = 4), Cosmospora (n = 2), Leuconeurospora (n = 2), Penicillium (n = 3), Pseudogymnoascus (n = 6), Thelebolus (n = 2), and Trichoderma (n = 1). The two isolates from the genus Leuconeurospora were characterized as psychrophilic, while the others were psychrotolerant. The Penicillium isolates were able to decolorize between 60 and 82% of IC. The isolates identified as Pseudogymnoascus showed the best detoxification capacity, with results varying from 49 to 74%. The consortium using only Antarctic ascomycetes (C1) showed 45% of decolorization, while the consortia with the addition of basidiomycetes (C1 + Peniophora and C1 + Pholiota) showed 40% and 50%, respectively. The consortia C1 with the addition of the basidiomycetes presented a lower toxicity after the treatments. In addition, a higher fungal biomass was produced in the presence of dye when compared with the experiment without the dye, which can be indicative of dye metabolization. The results highlight the potential of marine-derived Antarctic fungi in the process of textile dye degradation. The findings encourage further studies to elucidate the degradation and detoxification pathways of the dye IC by these fungal isolates. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.},

  abstract={The fungal strain, Penicillium griseofulvum P29, isolated from a soil sample taken from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, was found to be a good producer of sialidase (P29). The present study was focused on the purification and structural characterization of the enzyme. P29 enzyme was purified using a Q-Sepharose column and fast performance liquid chromatography separation on a Mono Q column. The determined molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 40 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 39924.40 Da by matrix desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis correlated well with the calculated mass (39903.75 kDa) from the amino acid sequence of the enzyme. P29 sialidase shows a temperature optimum of 37 °C and low-temperature stability, confirming its cold-active nature. The enzyme is more active towards α(2 → 3) sialyl linkages than those containing α(2 → 6) linkages. Based on the determined amino acid sequence and 3D structural modeling, a 3D model of P29 sialidase was presented, and the properties of the enzyme were explained. The conformational stability of the enzyme was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the new enzyme was found to be conformationally stable in the neutral pH range of pH 6 to pH 9. In addition, the enzyme was more stable in an alkaline environment than in an acidic environment. The purified cold-active enzyme is the only sialidase produced and characterized from Antarctic fungi to date. © 2023 The Authors},

  abstract={Understanding how different taxa respond to abiotic characteristics of the environment is of key interest for understanding the assembly of communities. Yet, whether eDNA data will suffice to accurately capture environmental imprints has been the topic of some debate. In this study, we characterised patterns of species occurrences and co-occurrences in Zackenberg in northeast Greenland using environmental DNA. To explore the potential for extracting ecological signals from eDNA data alone, we compared two approaches (visual vegetation surveys and soil eDNA metabarcoding) to describing plant communities and their responses to abiotic conditions. We then examined plant associations with microbes using a joint species distribution model. We found that most (68%) of plant genera were detectable by both vegetation surveys and eDNA signatures. Species-specific occurrence data revealed how plants, bacteria and fungi responded to their abiotic environment – with plants, bacteria and fungi all responding similarly to soil moisture. Nonetheless, a large proportion of fungi decreased in occurrences with increasing soil temperature. Regarding biotic associations, the nature and proportion of the plant-microbe associations detected were consistent between plant data identified via vegetation surveys and eDNA. Of pairs of plants and microbe genera showing statistically supported associations (while accounting for joint responses to the environment), plants and bacteria mainly showed negative associations, whereas plants and fungi mainly showed positive associations. Ample ecological signals detected by both vegetation surveys and by eDNA-based methods and a general correspondence in biotic associations inferred by both methods, suggested that purely eDNA-based approaches constitute a promising and easily applicable tool for studying plant-soil microbial associations in the Arctic and elsewhere. © Bastien Parisy et al.},

A variety of research methods were used in this work: the molecular genetic technique to establish the gene sequence, chemical to test the ability to produce nitrite, ammonia, and indole acetic acid, microbiological to investigate the cultured properties of the strain, as well as antagonistic and PGP activities. We found that the strain belongs to the genus Amycolatopsis.

  abstract={Natural pigments have received special attention from the market and industry as they could overcome the harm to health and the environmental issues caused by synthetic pigments. These pigments are commonly extracted from a wide range of organisms, and when added to products they can alter/add new physical–chemical or biological properties to them. Fungi from extreme environments showed to be a promising source in the search for biomolecules with antimicrobial and antiparasitic potential. This study aimed to isolate fungi from Antarctic soils and screen them for pigment production with antimicrobial and antiparasitic potential, together with other previously isolated strains A total of 52 fungi were isolated from soils in front of the Collins Glacier (Southeast border). Also, 106 filamentous fungi previously isolated from the Collins Glacier (West border) were screened for extracellular pigment production. Five strains were able to produce extracellular pigments and were identified by ITS sequencing as Talaromyces cnidii, Pseudogymnoascus shaanxiensis and Pseudogymnoascus sp. All Pseudogymnoascus spp. (SC04.P3, SC3.P3, SC122.P3 and ACF093) extracts were able to inhibit S. aureus ATCC6538 and two (SC12.P3, SC32.P3) presented activity against Leishmania (L.) infantum, Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanossoma cruzii. Extracts compounds characterization by UPLC-ESI-QToF analysis confirmed the presence of molecules with biological activity such as: Asterric acid, Violaceol, Mollicellin, Psegynamide A, Diorcinol, Thailandolide A. In conclusion, this work showed the potential of Antartic fungal strains from Collins Glacier for bioactive molecules production with activity against Gram positive bacteria and parasitic protozoas. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.},

  abstract={We studied the culturable fungal community recovered from deep marine sediments in the maritime Antarctic, and assessed their capabilities to produce exoenzymes, emulsifiers and metabolites with phytotoxic activity. Sixty-eight Ascomycota fungal isolates were recovered and identified. The most abundant taxon recovered was the yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii, followed by the filamentous fungi Penicillium chrysogenum, P. cf. palitans, Pseudeurotium cf. bakeri, Thelebolus balaustiformis, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and Cladosporium sp. Diversity indices displayed low values overall, with the highest values obtained at shallow depth, decreasing to the deepest location sampled. Only M. guilliermondii and P. cf. palitans were detected in the sediments at all depths sampled, and were the most abundant taxa at all sample sites. The most abundant enzymes detected were proteases, followed by invertases, cellulases, lipases, carrageenases, agarases, pectinases and esterases. Four isolates showed good biosurfactant activity, particularly the endemic species A. psychrotrophicus. Twenty-four isolates of P. cf. palitans displayed strong phytotoxic activities against the models Lactuca sativa and Allium schoenoprasum. The cultivable fungi recovered demonstrated good biosynthetic activity in the production of hydrolytic exoenzymes, biosurfactant molecules and metabolites with phytotoxic activity, reinforcing the importance of documenting the taxonomic, ecological and biotechnological properties of fungi present in deep oceanic sediments of the Southern Ocean. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

  abstract={The search for life beyond Earth currently hinges on the detection of biosignatures that are indicative of current or past life, with terrestrial life being the sole known example. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which acts as the long-term storage of genetic information in all known organisms, is considered a biosignature of life. Techniques like the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are particularly useful as they allow for the amplification of DNA fragments, allowing the detection of even trace amounts of genetic material. This study aimed to detect DNA extracted from colonies of an Antarctic black fungus both when (i) alone and (ii) mixed with a Sulfatic Mars Regolith Simulant (S-MRS), after exposure to increasing doses of Fe ions (up to 1 kGy). PCR-based amplification methods were used for detection. The findings of this study revealed no DNA amplification in samples mixed with Sulfatic Mars Regolith Simulant, providing important insights into the potential application of these techniques for in situ DNA detection during future space exploration missions or for their application on the Mars sample return program; it also gives input in the planetary protection discussions. © 2025 by the authors.},

  abstract={The surface temperatures of Antarctic soils and bryophyte colonies can fluctuate from close to freezing point to approximately 20 °C under clear skies around solar noon during midsummer. However, whether diurnally fluctuating temperatures influence the growth and metabolic activities of fungi inhabiting these substrates remains unknown. Here, 10 isolates of Pseudogymnoascus roseus, an ascomycete that is widespread in Antarctica, were exposed in vitro to temperatures fluctuating daily from 2 °C to 15–24 °C. Relative to controls incubated at the constant mean temperature of each treatment, temperatures fluctuating from 2 °C to ≥18 °C inhibited the growth of all isolates by 10–51% at 24 h and 48 h, and by up to 79% for individual isolates. Over a period of 21 days, all fluctuating temperature treatments reduced mean growth rates by between 3% and 48%, but had few effects on specific β-glucosidase activity, a proxy measure for metabolic activity. It is concluded that temperatures fluctuating diurnally to ≥18 °C during summer in mesic Antarctic soils and bryophyte colonies, exacerbated by the occurrence of climate-change associated heatwaves, are likely to inhibit the growth of P. roseus and perhaps also other ecologically important fungi. © 2023 The Author},

  abstract={The supply of recent photosynthate from plants to soils is thought to be a critical mechanism regulating the activity and diversity of soil biota. In the Arctic, large-scale vegetation transitions are underway in response to warming, and there is an urgent need to understand how these changes affect soil biodiversity and function. We investigated how abundance and diversity of soil fungi and invertebrates responded to a reduction in fresh below-ground photosynthate supply in treeline birch and willow, achieved using stem girdling. We hypothesised that birch forest would support greater abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal species and fauna than willow shrubs, and that girdling would result in a rapid switch from ECM fungi to saprotrophs as canopy supply of C was cut, with a concomitant decline in soil fauna. Birch forest had greater fungal and faunal abundance with a large contribution of root-associated ascomycetes (ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes) compared to willow shrub plots, which had a higher proportion of saprotrophs and, contrary to our expectations, ECM fungi. Broad-scale soil fungal and faunal functional group composition was not significantly changed by girdling, even in the third year of treatment. Within the ECM community, there were some changes, with genera that are believed to be particularly C-demanding declining in girdled plots. However, it was notable how most ECM fungi remained present after 3 years of isolation of the below-ground compartment from contemporary photosynthate supply. Synthesis. In a treeline/tundra ecosystem, distinct soil communities existed in contrasting vegetation patches within the landscape, but the structure of these communities was resistant to canopy disturbance and concomitant reduction of autotrophic C inputs. © 2022 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of environmental factors such as temperature, light, and nutrition on chlamydospore differentiation as well as pigment biosynthesis. Temperature did not affect chlamydospore production; it rather altered pigmentation development that also was affected by light. The composition of culture media as well as light modulated chlamydospore differentiation. Microscope observations, spectroscopic analysis as well as culture assays, using melanin inhibitors, suggest that the main pigment of chlamydospores of H. cephalosporioides is 1,8 dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin–type compound. Furthermore, we found that the genome of H. cephalosporioides contains a sequence highly homologous to the pks sequences of other fungi that have been associated with the biosynthesis of 1,8 DHN-melanin. All this together suggests that melanization is among the most important features linked to survival of this fungus in the soils of Nothofagus forests in sub-Antarctica region and that the ITS, 18S, and 28S rDNA sequences did not provide enough information to delineate the phylogenetic relationships of the fungus within the class Leotiomycetes. © 2022, German Mycological Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Most of the Antarctic continent and surrounding islands are permanently covered by ice. However, due to long-term natural and short term human-induced climate changes, glaciers in the maritime Antarctic islands are currently retreating, exposing new substrates for colonization by microorganisms and plants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the microbial communities along a transect comprised of soils with different exposition times since the glacier retreat in Barton Peninsula (King George Island). We observed an intense degree of microbial succession in young soils located in the Recently Exposed Area (REA), analogously to a game of ‘musical chairs’ where microbial species rapidly occupy available niches as new environments emerge. In contrast, more developed soils exhibited a less dynamic community turnover. The co-occurrence networks of both bacteria and fungi presented a less modular structure and a higher connectance in the REA, whereas a more modular structure was found in the three networks of the more developed soils. This suggests that these communities are more susceptible to external perturbations and microbial succession. Furthermore, the functional prediction demonstrated that the functional redundancy is lower in the REA than in more developed soils. The surprising high diversity of microbial communities adjacent to the glacier front deserves further studies to compare with different areas (in terms of substrate, climate) under a common present-day warming scenario. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

This genus includes two species, C. mucronulatus (the type species of the genus) and C. australis, which differ genetically. Until recently, data on the species diversity of Chodatodesmus and their biogeography were based on the study of a number of isolated strains. Records of the species were limited to the aquatic ecosystems of Turkey, Peru, and Antarctica. Here, we characterized the new strains of Chodatodesmus, IRK-A 290 and 449, from Lake Baikal by combining morphological (LM, SEM, TEM) and molecular phylogenetic (SSU rRNA, ITS, rbcL, and tufA) methods. The studied strains belonged to different species of the genus that were first recorded in Eurasia. The strain IRK-A 290 was referred to C. australis, and IRK-A 449 was described as a new species Chodatodesmus intermedia sp. nov. For the analysis, we also used sequences from soil metagenomes obtained within the project on the global distribution of fungi and deposited in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Chodatodesmus nucleotide sequences were found in soils in different regions of the world. This study showed that the majority of sequences from soil metagenomes refer to C. australis, and several sequences belong to the new phylogenetic clade of Chodatodesmus intermedia sp. nov. Sequences of C. mucronulatus were not detected in soils. The results obtained add to the data on the species diversity, morphology, genetic features, distribution, and occurrence of Chodatodesmus. © Gesellschaft für Biologische Systematik 2025.},

In this study, we conducted extensive sampling of marine sediments along a latitudinal transect spanning 2500 km from the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean to investigate the geographical distribution patterns of bacteria, archaea, and fungi. Our findings revealed that the community similarities of bacteria and fungi decay at similar rates with increasing geographical distance (slope: −0.005 and −0.002), which are much lower than the decay rate of archaeal communities (slope: −0.012). Notably, microbial richness and community composition showed significant differences in the region of 75−80°N compared to other regions in 60−75°N. Salinity, temperature, pH, ammonium nitrogen, and total organic carbon are key factors that significantly affect microbial community variations. Furthermore, bacterial co-occurrence networks showed more complex interactions but lower modularity than fungal counterparts. This study provides crucial insights into the spatial distribution patterns of bacteria, archaea, and fungi in the Arctic marine sediments and will be critical for a better understanding of microbial global distribution and ecological functions. © 2025 The Author(s). mLife published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract={In understanding stress response mechanisms in fungi, cold stress has received less attention than heat stress. However, cold stress has shown its importance in various research fields. The following study examined the cold stress response of six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolated from various biogeographical regions through a proteomic approach. In total, 2541 proteins were identified with high confidence. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed diversity in the cold stress response pathways for all six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolates, with metabolic and translation-related processes being prominent in most isolates. 25.6% of the proteins with an increase in relative abundance were increased by more than 3.0-fold. There was no link between the geographical origin of the isolates and the cold stress response of Pseudogymnoascus spp. However, one Antarctic isolate, sp3, showed a distinctive cold stress response profile involving increased flavin/riboflavin biosynthesis and methane metabolism. This Antarctic isolate (sp3) was also the only one that showed decreased phospholipid metabolism in cold stress conditions. This work will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cold stress response and adaptation in psychrotolerant soil microfungi, with specific attention to the fungal genus Pseudogymnoascus. © 2023, The Author(s).},

This research aimed to identify the soil arthropod, nematode, bacterial, and fungal communities associated with penguin carrion on King George Island, Antarctica. Soil samples were collected around and beneath fresh (freshly killed penguins by the predators) and dried (decomposed more than a year) penguin carrion. Soil bacterial and fungal communities associated with the penguin carrion were analyzed using the 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequencing, respectively. Arthropod identification was using Sanger sequencing and nematodes were determined using morphological identification. This study demonstrated no significant differences in arthropod and nematode, bacteria, and fungi communities between decomposition stages, soil location, and species of penguin carrion. This is the first study to identify soil arthropods, nematodes, bacterial, and fungal communities associated with penguin carrion, offering important insights into the initial documentation of the necrobiome communities in the polar region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Studies on the diversity and catabolic functionality of fungi in Arctic soils are still scarce. This knowledge gap needs to be urgently addressed, as global warming may have unpredictable effects on cold-adapted fungal species. We isolated two yeast species of the family Filobasidiaceae: Goffeauzyma gilvescens and Naganishia albidosimilis, from soil in central Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and characterised their metabolic properties at two temperatures, 4°C and 20°C, in a laboratory test using Biolog® FF plates. The results of the Biolog® test, which followed molecular identification of the strains, confirmed that the two species differed in their functional (catabolic) characteristics. The effect of temperature was also highly significant and the metabolic characteristics of two species varied between the two temperatures tested. As expected, among other chemical guilds of substrates on Biolog® plates, carbohydrates were the most used and also the most segregating of the strains studied, especially at 20°C. However, the relative use of almost all substrate groups changed between the two temperatures for both species tested, indicating that temperature can also affect soil microorganisms indirectly by altering their metabolic pathways. As soil microorganisms form a complex trophic and non-trophic network, such changes in metabolism under increasing temperature may also alter relationships between species and between species and the environment. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the microbial ecology of the unique ecosystem of polar soils. © 2024 Beata Klimek, Przemysław Ryszka, Piotr Zieliński, Federica Carlea, Katarzyna Wojczulanis-Jakubas and Dominika Wloch-Salamon.},

  abstract={Antarctic soils are unique from those found nearly anywhere else on Earth yet can still harbor a broad diversity of microorganisms able to tolerate the challenging conditions typical of the continent. For these reasons, microbiologists have been drawn to Antarctica for decades. However, our understanding of which microbes thrive in Antarctic soils and how they to do so remains limited. To help resolve these knowledge gaps, we analyzed a collection of 200 archived Antarctic soils—from Livingston Island on the Antarctic Peninsula to Cape Hallett in northern Victoria Land. We analyzed the prokaryotic and fungal communities in these soils using both cultivation-independent marker gene sequencing and cultivation-dependent approaches (microbial isolation), paired with extensive soil geochemical analyses. Our cultivation-independent analyses indicate that colder, saltier, and drier soils harbor less diverse communities of bacteria and fungi, distinct from those found in soils with less challenging conditions. We also built a culture collection from a subset of these soils that encompasses more than 50 bacterial and fungal genera, including cold-tolerant organisms, such as Cryobacterium and Cryomyces. By directly comparing the diversity of our cultured isolates against our cultivation-independent data, we show that many of the more abundant Antarctic taxa are not readily cultivated and highlight bacterial and fungal taxa that should be the focus of future cultivation efforts. Together, we hope that our collection of isolates, the comprehensive data compiled from the cultivation-independent analyses, and our geochemical analyses will serve as a community resource to accelerate the study of Antarctic soil microbes. © The Author(s) 2025.},

This work investigated the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by two Pseudogymnoascus fungal strains, VKM F-4518 and VKM F-4519, isolated from the surface soil layer of the Kolyma Lowland, Russia, in the Arctic. In these strains, 16-membered trilactone macrolides, (+)-macrosphelides A and B, were identified using 1D and 2D NMR, UHRMS, and optical rotation data. In the fungi of this genus, these metabolites were found for the first time. The studied strains are highly active producers of macrosphelide A, which is being considered as a promising agent for the cure of cancer. Using the antiSMASH secondary metabolite analysis tool, we found that the genome of strain VKM F-4518 contained 32 of the biosynthetic clusters of the secondary metabolite genes (BGC) and that of VKM F-4519 had 17 BGCs. Based on the comparison of the cluster of macrotriolide genes from the fungus Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa, we found the complete supposed cluster BGCs of macrosphelides in the genomes of two Pseudogymnoascus strains using the BLAST+ program. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Extreme cold environments like glaciers, present substantial obstacles to the survival of organisms. Cryoconite, dark sediment covering glacier, provide unique niche for microorganisms. Therefore, we focused on understanding the diversity of fungi in Arctic ecosystems (Hansbreen, Spitsbergen), which is important in the analysis of the structure and of fungi populations. Due to a combination of two incubation temperatures (7°C or 24°C) and two media during isolation (potato dextrose agar, PDA or yeast extract peptone glucose, YPG), and classical/molecular identification approaches, we identified 20 different fungi (17 species and three unassigned species). Most belonged to filamentous fungi within the Ascomycota (19 isolates), with one identified as Basidiomycota-yeast. Regarding growth conditions, both media yielded greater number of fungal cultures at 24°C compared to 7°C. Additionally, PDA was more effective than YPG in isolating fungal cultures. On the other hand, the optimal temperature for achieving the highest CFU (colony–forming unit)/g of sediment was 7°C. The most frequently isolated species was Cladosporium cladosporioides, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to detect, the following species in an Arctic environment: Aspergillus jensenii, A. tennesseensis, Peziza varia, and Trichoderma paraviridescens. Additionally, there was a visible increase in the number of fungal propagules but a decrease in their biodiversity towards the upper parts of the glacier. Considering the Arctic amplification there is a need for further research on diversity and function of fungi in glacial ecosystems. © 2024 Polska Akademia Nauk. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Metabolites isolated from Penicillium palitans, obtained from deep sea sediments in the maritime Antarctica, were investigated for phytotoxic and antifungal activities. The fungus was submitted to solid state fermentation, and its crude extract was produced. Chromatographic separations of the P. palitans methylene chloride crude extract led to the isolation of two analogous compounds: (−)-penienone (1) and (−)-palitantin (2). The phytotoxic activity of these compounds was assessed against seeds of Lactuca sativa and Agrostis stolonifera. Both compounds demonstrated activity exclusively in the monocotyledonous model, A. stolonifera. At a concentration of 1 mg mL−1, (−)-penienone caused 100 % inhibition of seed germination, while (−)-palitantin had only moderate activity on germination and growth of seedlings at this concentration after 7 days of treatment. Against Lemna paucicostata, at 57 μM, (−)-penienone inhibited growth by 50 % (IC50). (−)-Palitantin was much less active. When evaluated for their antifungal activity against Colletotrichum fragariae, only (−)-penienone had an IC50 value of 0.3 μM. The strain P. palitans was shown to be a promising source of phytotoxic and antifungal compounds, suggesting that extremophilic fungi, such as wild Penicillium strains from Antarctica, have the potential to yield novel prototype molecules for new pesticide development. © 2024 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.},

  abstract={In recent decades the habitat of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) has expanded from boreal forests into Arctic tundra ecosystems. Beaver ponds in Arctic watersheds are known to alter stream biogeochemistry, which is likely coupled with changes in the activity and composition of microbial communities inhabiting beaver pond sediments. We investigated bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities in beaver pond sediments along tundra streams in northwestern Alaska (AK), USA and compared them to those of tundra lakes and streams in north-central Alaska that are unimpacted by beavers. β-glucosidase activity assays indicated higher cellulose degradation potential in beaver ponds than in unimpacted streams and lakes within a watershed absent of beavers. Beta diversity analyses showed that dominant lineages of bacteria and archaea in beaver ponds differed from those in tundra lakes and streams, but dominant fungal lineages did not differ between these sample types. Beaver pond sediments displayed lower relative abundances of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota archaea and of bacteria from typically anaerobic taxonomic groups, suggesting differences in rates of fermentative organic matter (OM) breakdown, syntrophy, and methane generation. Beaver ponds also displayed low relative abundances of Chytridiomycota (putative non-symbiotic) fungi and high relative abundances of ectomycorrhizal (plant symbionts) Basidiomycota fungi, suggesting differences in the occurrence of plant and fungi mutualistic interactions. Beaver ponds also featured microbes with taxonomic identities typically associated with the cycling of nitrogen and sulfur compounds in higher relative abundances than tundra lakes and streams. These findings help clarify the microbiological implications of beavers expanding into high latitude regions. © 2023. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract={Background Incomplete species inventories for Antarctica represent a key challenge for comprehensive ecological research and conservation in the region. Additionally, data required to understand population dynamics, rates of evolution, spatial ranges, functional traits, physiological tolerances and species interactions, all of which are fundamental to disentangle the different functional elements of Antarctic biodiversity, are mostly missing. However, much of the fauna, flora and microbiota in the emerged ice-free land of the continent have an uncertain presence and/or unresolved status, with entire biodiversity compendia of prokaryotic groups (e.g. bacteria) being missing. All the available biodiversity information requires consolidation, cross-validation, re-assessment and steady systematic inclusion in order to create a robust catalogue of biodiversity for the continent. New information We compiled, completed and revised eukaryotic species inventories present in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in Antarctica in a new living database: terrANTALife (version 1.0). The database includes the first integration in a compendium for many groups of eukaryotic microorganisms. We also introduce a first catalogue of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of prokaryotic biodiversity. Available compendia and literature to date were searched for Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater species, integrated, taxonomically harmonised and curated by experts to create comprehensive checklists of Antarctic organisms. The final inventories comprises 470 animal species (including vertebrates, freeliving invertebrates and parasites), 306 plants (including all Viridiplantae: embryophytes and green algae), 997 fungal species and 434 protists (sensu lato). We also provide a first account for many groups of microorganisms, including non-lichenised fungi and multiple groups of eukaryotic unicellular species (Stramenophila, Alveolata and Rhizaria (SAR), Chromists and Amoeba), jointly referred to as "protists". In addition, we identify 1753 bacterial (obtained from 348117 ASVs) and 34 archaeal genera (from 1848 ASVs), as well as, at least, 14 virus families. We formulate a basic tree of life in Antarctica with the main lineages listed in the region and their “known-accepted-species” numbers. © Pertierra L et al.

  abstract={Despite low temperatures, poor nutrient levels and high pressure, microorganisms thrive in deep-sea environments of polar regions. The adaptability to such extreme environments renders deep-sea microorganisms an encouraging source of novel, bioactive secondary metabolites. In this study, we isolated 77 microorganisms collected by a remotely operated vehicle from the seafloor in the Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean (depth of 2454 m). Thirty-two bacteria and six fungal strains that represented the phylogenetic diversity of the isolates were cultured using an One-Strain-Many-Compounds (OSMAC) approach. The crude EtOAc extracts were tested for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. While antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium was common for many isolates, only two bacteria displayed anticancer activity, and two fungi inhibited the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Due to bioactivity against C. albicans and rich chemical diversity based on molecular network-based untargeted metabolomics, Aspergillus versicolor PS108-62 was selected for an in-depth chemical investigation. A chemical work-up of the SPE-fractions of its dichloromethane subextract led to the isolation of a new PKS-NRPS hybrid macrolactone, versicolide A (1), a new quinazoline (−)-isoversicomide A (3), as well as three known compounds, burnettramic acid A (2), cyclopenol (4) and cyclopenin (5). Their structures were elucidated by a combination of HRMS, NMR, [α]D, FT-IR spectroscopy and computational approaches. Due to the low amounts obtained, only compounds 2 and 4 could be tested for bioactivity, with 2 inhibiting the growth of C. albicans (IC50 7.2 µg/mL). These findings highlight, on the one hand, the vast potential of the genus Aspergillus to produce novel chemistry, particularly from underexplored ecological niches such as the Arctic deep sea, and on the other, the importance of untargeted metabolomics for selection of marine extracts for downstream chemical investigations. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract={Abstract: Potential to produce inducible enzymes (several hydrolases and oxidases) and antibiotics as secondary metabolites was studied in soil micromycete strains from the Arctic (Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya) and Antarctica (the oases Thala Hills, Larsemann Hills, Schirmacher, and Marie Byrd Land). Maximal esterase activity was observed in strains of two typical Antarctic species, Hyphozyma variabilis 218 and Thelebolus ellipsoideus 210 (51 and 29 nmol FDA/((g mycelium h), respectively). Cellulolytic activity was maximal (89 µmol glucose/mg biomass) in Ascochyta pisi 192. Extracellular phenol oxidase (laccase) and peroxidase activities were not detected in the strains examined. Antibacterial activity toward Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was observed in 75% of the Antarctic micromycete strains. Higher-activity strains were isolated from organic-rich moist habitats with a moss or lichen cover. Maximal activities were displayed by Paecilomyces marquandii 166, Penicillium janczewskii 165, Penicillium roseopurpureum 169, and Thelebolus ellipsoideus 210. Antagonistic activity toward Antarctic bacterial strains was shown by 77% of the microfungal strains examined. Maximal inhibition was observed with strains of the typical Antarctic species Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus MT303855 and the eurytopic species Sarocladium kiliense MT303856. Antimycotic activity was observed in 42% of the strains. Both activities were detected in 38% of the Antarctic strains. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  abstract={Climate change is affecting winter snow conditions significantly in northern ecosystems but the effects of the changing conditions for soil microbial communities are not well-understood. We utilized naturally occurring differences in snow accumulation to understand how the wintertime subnivean conditions shape bacterial and fungal communities in dwarf shrub-dominated sub-Arctic Fennoscandian tundra sampled in mid-winter, early, and late growing season. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and quantitative PCR analyses indicated that fungal abundance was higher in windswept tundra heaths with low snow accumulation and lower nutrient availability. This was associated with clear differences in the microbial community structure throughout the season. Members of Clavaria spp. and Sebacinales were especially dominant in the windswept heaths. Bacterial biomass proxies were higher in the snow-accumulating tundra heaths in the late growing season but there were only minor differences in the biomass or community structure in winter. Bacterial communities were dominated by members of Alphaproteobacteria, Actinomycetota, and Acidobacteriota and were less affected by the snow conditions than the fungal communities. The results suggest that small-scale spatial patterns in snow accumulation leading to a mosaic of differing tundra heath vegetation shapes bacterial and fungal communities as well as soil carbon and nutrient availability. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Geological and mineralogical evidence indicates that water once flowed on Mars. The recent discovery of present ice-water on the planet's surface is one of the driving factors for life-detection missions. The highly radiative Martian surface, combined with aqueous thin layers, is prohibitive for the presence of hypothetical forms of terrestrial-like life on the planet. In this context, we examined the survival of hydrated colonies of the Antarctic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus, which thrives in the extreme environment of McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica, after the exposure to increasing doses of space relevant γ-rays. Results suggest that water significantly reduces the number of survivors at the lowest doses, while at the higher dose (117 kGy) the cumulative damage caused by radiation could no longer be counteracted by dehydration. © 2024},

  abstract={Bioaerosols, prevalent in the atmosphere, serve as carriers for microbe transmission and can also act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and Ice Nuclei (IN), exerting significant influence on cloud microphysics, radiative forcing, precipitation processes, and global climate dynamics. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of airborne fungi from the Northwest Pacific to the Arctic Ocean. During the 9th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (Chinare, 2018) cruise, total suspended particulate matter (TSP) samples were collected, followed by high-throughput sequencing to determine the microbial community's structure. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are widespread in marine fungal aerosols along this route, with a notably higher abundance of Epicoccum and Cladosporium in fungal aerosols from the low-latitude Northwest Pacific compared to the high-latitude Arctic Ocean region. The composition of fungal communities depended on air mass transport processes and environmental factors. Long-range transport of terrestrial air masses not only enriches the abundance of fungal aerosols but also increases the relative abundance of dominant genera such as Basidiomycota, Epicoccum and Cladosporium. The knowledge gap about fungal aerosols over the Arctic route from the Northwest Pacific to the Arctic Ocean was filled in part by this work. This study deepens our understanding of how environmental factors and terrestrial air masses influence the composition and distribution of fungal community, offering valuable insights into the interconnections between marine and terrestrial ecosystems and their potential impacts on climate and atmospheric processes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Wind-blown pollen (pollen rain) is a major contributor to element cycling in modern forests and aquatic ecosystems, particularly in high-latitude and acidic settings where nutrients are a limiting factor. The rich package of proteins, nitrogen and phosphorus residing within pollen is, nonetheless, inaccessible to most organisms, owing to the indigestible sporopollenin walls. Saprotrophic breakdown by fungi, and some non-fungal microorganisms, can make nutrients bioavailable, and represents a key trophic link in element cycling and the transfer of organic carbon. Little is known about when micro-saprotrophs first adapted to exploit pollen, thus establishing this crucial step in the evolution of modern terrestrial ecosystems. One approach is to examine the rich fossil record of palynomorphs. Here we describe translucent bodies referable either to fungi (Chytridiomycota) or water moulds (Oomycetes) within the pollen of glossopterid gymnosperms and cordaitaleans, and fern spores from silicified Permian (Guadalupian–Lopingian) peats of the Toploje Member, Bainmedart Coal Measures, Prince Charles Mountains, Antarctica. These probable holocarpic thalli or oospores exploited the nutrient-rich microgametophyte tissue of dispersed miospores in high-palaeolatitude wetlands. The exceptional preservation of fossil microorganisms in permineralised peats offers insights into the deep-time evolution of intimate ecological relationships, otherwise known only among extant biotas. Permineralisation has preserved sub-micron details of these delicate and cryptic saprotrophs that likely played key roles in cycling nutrients in the acidic forest mires of the Permian. Our study reveals that the extensive recapture of spore/pollen-derived nutrients via saprotrophic digestion was already at play in the high-latitude ecosystems of the late Palaeozoic. © 2024 The Author(s).

  abstract={The retreat of glaciers in Antarctica has increased in the last decades due to global climate change, influencing vegetation expansion, and soil physico-chemical and biological attributes. However, little is known about soil microbiology diversity in these periglacial landscapes. This study characterized and compared bacterial and fungal diversity using metabarcoding of soil samples from the Byers Peninsula, Maritime Antarctica. We identified bacterial and fungal communities by amplification of bacterial 16 S rRNA region V3–V4 and fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1). We also applied 14C dating on soil organic matter (SOM) from six profiles. Physico-chemical analyses and attributes associated with SOM were evaluated. A total of 14,048 bacterial ASVs were obtained, and almost all samples had 50% of their sequences assigned to Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria. Regarding the fungal community, Mortierellomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the main phyla from 1619 ASVs. We found that soil age was more relevant than the distance from the glacier, with the oldest soil profile (late Holocene soil profile) hosting the highest bacterial and fungal diversity. The microbial indices of the fungal community were correlated with nutrient availability, soil reactivity and SOM composition, whereas the bacterial community was not correlated with any soil attribute. The bacterial diversity, richness, and evenness varied according to presence of permafrost and moisture regime. The fungal community richness in the surface horizon was not related to altitude, permafrost, or moisture regime. The soil moisture regime was crucial for the structure, high diversity and richness of the microbial community, specially to the bacterial community. Further studies should examine the relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors to better predict changes in this terrestrial ecosystem. © 2023 The Authors},

  abstract={Fungi are a ubiquitous component of marine systems, but their quantitative relevance, biodiversity and ecological role in benthic deep-sea ecosystems remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated fungal abundance, diversity and assemblage composition in two benthic deep-sea sites of the Ross Sea (Southern Ocean, Antarctica), characterized by different environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, salinity, trophic availability). Our results indicate that fungal abundance (estimated as the number of 18S rDNA copies g−1) varied by almost one order of magnitude between the two benthic sites, consistently with changes in sediment characteristics and trophic availability. The highest fungal richness (in terms of Amplicon Sequence Variants−ASVs) was encountered in the sediments characterized by the highest organic matter content, indicating potential control of trophic availability on fungal diversity. The composition of fungal assemblages was highly diverse between sites and within each site (similarity less than 10%), suggesting that differences in environmental and ecological characteristics occurring even at a small spatial scale can promote high turnover diversity. Overall, this study provides new insights on the factors influencing the abundance and diversity of benthic deep-sea fungi inhabiting the Ross Sea, and also paves the way for a better understanding of the potential responses of benthic deep-sea fungi inhabiting Antarctic ecosystems in light of current and future climate changes. © 2022 by the authors.

Until now, the biogeography of the fungal communities in the bipolar regions is not well known. In this study, we focused on the fungal communities in 110 samples collected from four habitat types (i.e., soil, vascular plant, freshwater, moss) in the Antarctic and Arctic sites using high-throughput sequencing. The data showed that the diversity and composition of fungal communities were both geographically patterned and habitat-patterned. ANOSIM tests revealed statistically significant differences among fungal communities in the eight sample types (R = 0.5035, p < 0.001) and those in the bipolar regions (R = 0.32859, p < 0.001). Only 396 OTUs (14.8%) were shared between the bipolar sites. Fungal communities in the four habitat types clustered together in the Arctic site but were separate from those of the Antarctic site, indicating that geographic distance was a more important determinant of fungal communities in the bipolar sites.

  abstract={Walker Glacier near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic (terrestrial margin of the ‘Last Ice Area’) is undergoing rapid ice attrition in response to climate change. We applied culture and molecular methods to investigate fungal diversity at the terminus of this glacier. Analysis of the mycoflora composition showed that the Walker Glacier isolates sep-arated into two clusters: the surface of the glacier ice and the glacier foreland. The recently exposed sediments of the foreland had a lower fungal diversity and different species from those on the ice, with the exception of five species that occurred in both habitats. This loss of glacial ice in the Arctic is therefore resulting in the loss of habitats for cold-dwelling fungal species. Fungal diversity is a potentially rich biological resource of glacial ecosystems, with unique taxa. The rapid loss of these glacial habitats underscores the urgency for genomic surveys of fungal diversity in the High Arctic, and the need for further isolation of strains as well as cryopreservation of environmental micro-biome samples for future research and conservation. © 2022 by the authors.

During the Oldest Dryas (18–14.75 ka cal. BP), climatic conditions were the coldest with a short ice-free season allowing the development of periphytic diatoms only (ecologically comparable to Arctic ones). A cold and dry steppe landscape – exposed to severe erosion – comprised an herbaceous and shrub flora (e.g. Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Helianthemum, Ephedra, Hippophaë, Juniperus). Animal presence is suggested by coprophilous fungi. Periphytic diatoms and allochtonous pollen (Cedrus) underline windy conditions, and the possible erosion of neo-formed soils. Then, during the Bølling-Allerød interstadial (14.75–12.7 ka cal. BP), the ice-free season increased and some trees/shrubs (Salix, Betula and Juniperus) established locally within open grasslands. During the Younger Dryas (12.7–11.7 ka cal. BP) cooler conditions favoured steppe taxa again (Helianthemum, Achillea, Artemisia, Caryophyllaceae, Ranunculaceae) and erosion increased. The ice cover on the lake prevailed even if the conditions were not as cold as during the Oldest Dryas. During the Preboreal (11.7–10 ka cal. BP) Isoëtes echinospora and I. lacustris developed in the eulittoral zone of the lake, which was surrounded by a swamp forest (with Betula nana and B. pubescens). Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula, Corylus avellana and trees from the Quercetum mixtum rapidly established in the uplands. Occurrences of Gaeumannomyces and Xylomyces fungi – both phytopathogens on broadleaved trees – and decreasing herb values indirectly hint at a close forest canopy. At the beginning of the Boreal (10 ka cal. BP), aquatic and semi-aquatic taxa developed on open water due to longer ice-free seasons (diatoms, micro-algae, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Potamogeton, Typha). The final terrestrialization towards a mire occurred as a consequence of the Holocene warming and related to water chemistry changes (acidification, eutrophication). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA},

  abstract={Permafrost affected soils are highly vulnerable to climate change. These soils store huge amounts of organic carbon (C), and a significant proportion of this carbon is stored in subsoil horizons where it might become available to microbial decomposition under global warming. An important factor in understanding and quantifying the C release from soils include the limitation of resources for microbes. Microbes decompose soil organic matter (SOM) by secreting extracellular enzymes into the soil, thus enzyme activity and their ratios are considered important indicators of soil nutrient availability and microbial substrate limitation. To evaluate nutrient limitation and the limitation of microbial substrate utilization, we investigated the potential enzyme activity from whole soil profiles, including topsoil, cryoturbated organic matter, mineral subsoil, and permafrost of Herschel Island (Canada) and Disko Island (Greenland). We included seven enzymes (five hydrolytic and two oxidative) and related them to bacterial and fungal gene abundance. The results showed hydrolytic enzymatic activity was strongly influenced by soil type, whereas oxidative enzymes varied between different localities. The enzyme ratios indicated that the topsoil microbial communities were C and phosphorus (P) co-limited in both localities, whereas the subsoil communities were nitrogen (N) limited from HI and C, P limited from DI. A strong positive correlation between all measured enzymes and bacterial gene abundance compared to that of fungi suggested that bacteria might play a more important role in SOM decomposition in permafrost soil horizons. This study suggests that Arctic permafrost microbial communities were not only limited by N, but also by C, P, and their co-limitation under specific conditions (i.e., higher abundance of bacteria and lower abundance of fungi). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The metabarcoding data indicated that Antarctic lakes may represent a hotspot of fungal diversity in Antarctica. The sediments of these lakes may accumulate different fungal fragments and active fungal mycelia and their propagules, deposited over long periods of time. Lakes in the Antarctic Peninsula region are sensitive environments threatened by the effects of regional climatic changes. The abundance of sequences of little-known Rozellomycota and Chytridiomycota (Spizellomycetales) taxa in these ecosystems highlights the need for further studies to identify if they are metabolically active in the sediments and whether they have potentially pathogenic capabilities. © 2022 British Mycological Society},

  abstract={Climatic change is pointed as one of the major challenges for global food security. Based on current models of climate change, reduction in precipitations and in turn, increase in the soil salinity will be a sharp constraint for crops productivity worldwide. In this context, root fungi appear as a new strategy to improve plant ecophysiological performance and crop yield under abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the two fungal endophytes Penicillium brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum isolated from Antarctic plants on nutrients and Na+ contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency, yield and survival in tomato and lettuce, facing salinity stress conditions. Inoculation of plant roots with fungal endophytes resulted in greater fresh and dry biomass production, and an enhanced survival rate under salt conditions. Inoculation of plants with the fungal endophytes was related with a higher up/down-regulation of ion homeostasis by enhanced expression of the NHX1 gene. The two endophytes diminished the effects of salt stress in tomato and lettuce, provoked a higher efficiency in photosynthetic energy production and an improved sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles is suggested by the upregulating of the expression of vacuolar NHX1 Na+/H+ antiporters. Promoting plant-beneficial interactions with root symbionts appears to be an environmentally friendly strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change variables on crop production. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Rhizosphere microbial communities exert critical roles in plant health, nutrient cycling, and soil fertility. Despite the essential functions conferred by microbes, the source and acquisition of the rhizosphere are not entirely clear. Therefore, we investigated microbial community diversity and potential source using the only two native Antarctic plants, Deschampsia antarctica (Da) and Colobanthus quitensis (Cq), as models. We interrogated rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes at six locations in the Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica, both individual plant species and their association (Da.Cq). Our results show that host plant species influenced the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Here, the Da rhizosphere showed the lowest richness and diversity of bacteria compared to Cq and Da.Cq rhizospheres. In contrast, for rhizosphere fungal communities, plant species only influenced diversity, whereas the rhizosphere of Da exhibited higher fungal diversity than the Cq rhizosphere. Also, we found that environmental geographic pressures (i.e., sampling site, latitude, and altitude) and, to a lesser extent, biotic factors (i.e., plant species) determined the species turnover between microbial communities. Moreover, our analysis shows that the sources of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere were local soils that contributed to homogenizing the community composition of the different plant species growing in the same sampling site. In contrast, the sources of rhizosphere fungi were local (for Da and Da.Cq) and distant soils (for Cq). Here, the host plant species have a specific effect in acquiring fungal communities to the rhizosphere. However, the contribution of unknown sources to the fungal rhizosphere (especially in Da and Da.Cq) indicates the existence of relevant stochastic processes in acquiring these microbes. Our study shows that rhizosphere microbial communities differ in their composition and diversity. These differences are explained mainly by the microbial composition of the soils that harbor them, acting together with plant species-specific effects. Both plant species acquire bacteria from local soils to form part of their rhizosphere. Seemingly, the acquisition process is more complex for fungi. We identified a significant contribution from unknown fungal sources due to stochastic processes and known sources from soils across the Byers Peninsula.

  abstract={In Victoria Land, Antarctica, ice-free areas are restricted to coastal regions and dominate the landscape of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. These two environments are subjected to different pressures that determine the establishment of highly adapted fungal communities. Within the kingdom of fungi, filamentous, yeasts and meristematic/microcolonial growth forms on one side and different lifestyles on the other side may be considered adaptive strategies of particular interest in the frame of Antarctic constraints. In this optic, soil fungal communities from both coastal and Dry Valleys sites, already characterized thorough ITS1 metabarcoding sequencing, have been compared to determine the different distribution of phyla, growth forms, and lifestyles. Though we did not find significant differences in the richness between the two environments, the communities were highly differentiated and Dry Valleys sites had a higher evenness compared to coastal ones. Additionally, the distribution of different growth forms and lifestyles were well differentiated, and their diversity and composition were likely influenced by soil abiotic parameters, among which soil granulometry, pH, P, and C contents were the potential main determinants. © 2021 by the authors.

Current formulations of the enzyme are highly bacterial in nature which have resulted in adverse reactions. The current paper focusses on production of glutaminase and urease free ASNase in a laboratory scale bioreactor using two fungal species and their efficiency in the scaling up process. The isolated species are Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 and Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1 isolated from wheat bran and Antarctic moss respectively. The experiments were conducted under different conditions known as initial, optimized and immobilized. Enzyme activity at these conditions for Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 were found to be 10.85, 13.56, 17.18 U mL−1 respectively and for Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1 were found to be 13.97, 19.53, 21.98 U mL−1 respectively in laboratory scale. The consistency of the scale-up data from the shake flask level to the laboratory scale level was found to be greater than 90% efficiency. It was also observed that aeration condition had an impact on the enzyme production with maximum enzyme activity of 13.48 U mL−1 for the Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 and 19.95 U mL−1 for Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1 being reported at an aeration rate of 1 Lpm.

The 16S rRNA-based analysis showed the predominance of the Actinomycetales order, a well-known group of bioactive metabolite producers belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum. Cultivation techniques were applied, and 72 psychrotolerant Actinobacteria strains belonging to the genera Actinoplanes, Arthrobacter, Kribbella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pilimelia, Pseudarthrobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptacidiphilus, Streptomyces and Tsukamurella were identified. The secondary metabolites were screened, and 17 isolates were identified as promising antitumour compound producers. However, the bio-guided assay showed a pronounced antiproliferative activity for the crude extracts of Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1527 and Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1653. The TGI and LC50 values revealed the potential of these natural products to control the proliferation of breast (MCF-7), glioblastoma (U251), lung/non-small (NCI-H460) and kidney (786-0) human cancer cell lines. Cinerubin B and actinomycin V were the predominant compounds identified in Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1527 and Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1653, respectively. Our results suggest that the rhizosphere of D. antarctica represents a prominent reservoir of bioactive actinobacteria strains and reveals it as an important environment for potential antitumour agents. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={We characterized the diversity, distribution, systematic colonization, and xerophilic capabilities of fungi associated with the Antarctic angiosperms Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica collected at different sites of the South Shetlands Islands, Antarctic Peninsula. A total of 684 fungal isolates were obtained and identified into 67 taxa from 32 genera. The highest fungal diversity and richness were obtained from the rhizosphere, roots, and leaves, in order, and only 11 taxa shared between both plants. Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus were the dominant fungal genera. However, the rarefaction curves for plant fungal assemblages did not reach a plateau, suggesting that these Antarctic plants may host more fungi in their tissues and rhizospheres. A total of 460 isolates grew at water activity (aw) = 0.95, 200 at 0.90, 110 at 0.81, and 47 at 0.66. Antarctomyces, Cladosporium, Mortierella, Leptosphaeria, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, and Thelebolus taxa grew at aw = 0.81 and 0.66 and considered highly xerophilic. In addition, specific isolates of Penicillium and Thelebolus exhibited the highest mycelial growth at aw = 0.66. Our results show that the internal tissues and rhizosphere of Antarctic angiosperms host rich and diverse fungal communities dominated by cold-adapted and endemic taxa, which seem to coexist as symbionts and decomposer fungi. In addition, specific fungi are able to colonize different parts of the plant, suggesting a high ecological relationship with their hosts. Finally, different fungi living in the rhizosphere displayed remarkable xerophilic tolerance, representing promising candidates for further biotechnological studies, including identification of genes for applications in industry and agriculture. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Climate change has a major impact on arctic and boreal terrestrial ecosystems as warming leads to northward treeline shifts, inducing consequences for heterotrophic organisms associated with the plant taxa. To unravel ecological dependencies, we address how long-term climatic changes have shaped the co-occurrence of plants and fungi across selected sites in Siberia. We investigated sedimentary ancient DNA from five lakes spanning the last 47,000 years, using the ITS1 marker for fungi and the chloroplast P6 loop marker for vegetation metabarcoding. We obtained 706 unique fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 243 taxa for the plants. We show higher OTU numbers in dry forest tundra as well as boreal forests compared to wet southern tundra. The most abundant fungal taxa in our dataset are Pseudeurotiaceae, Mortierella, Sordariomyceta, Exophiala, Oidiodendron, Protoventuria, Candida vartiovaarae, Pseudeurotium, Gryganskiella fimbricystis, and Trichosporiella cerebriformis. The overall fungal composition is explained by the plant composition as revealed by redundancy analysis. The fungal functional groups show antagonistic relationships in their climate susceptibility. The advance of woody taxa in response to past warming led to an increase in the abundance of mycorrhizae, lichens, and parasites, while yeast and saprotroph distribution declined. We also show co-occurrences between Salicaceae, Larix, and Alnus and their associated pathogens and detect higher mycorrhizal fungus diversity with the presence of Pinaceae. Under future warming, we can expect feedbacks between fungus composition and plant diversity changes which will affect forest advance, species diversity, and ecosystem stability in arctic regions. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract={Herbivory by barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) alters the vegetation cover and reduces ecosystem productivity in high-Arctic peatlands, limiting the carbon sink strength of these ecosystems. Here we investigate how herbivory-induced vegetation changes affect the activities of peat soil microbiota using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and targeted metabolomics in a comparison of fenced exclosures and nearby grazed sites. Our results show that a different vegetation with a high proportion of vascular plants developed due to reduced herbivory, resulting in a larger and more diverse input of polysaccharides to the soil at exclosed study sites. This coincided with higher sugar and amino acid concentrations in the soil at this site as well as the establishment of a more abundant and active microbiota, including saprotrophic fungi with broad substrate ranges, like Helotiales (Ascomycota) and Agaricales (Basidiomycota). A detailed description of fungal transcriptional profiles revealed higher gene expression for cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin and chitin degradation at herbivory-exclosed sites. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the number of genes and transcripts for predatory eukaryotes such as Entomobryomorpha (Arthropoda). We conclude that in the absence of herbivory, the development of a vascular vegetation alters the soil polysaccharide composition and supports larger and more active populations of fungi and predatory eukaryotes. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Plastic pollution poses a threat to terrestrial ecosystems, even impacting soils from remote alpine and arctic areas. Biodegradable plastics are a promising solution to prevent long-term accumulation of plastic litter. However, little is known about the decomposition of biodegradable plastics in soils from alpine and polar ecosystems or the microorganisms involved in the process. Plastics in aquatic environments have previously been shown to form a microbial community on the surface of the plastic distinct from that in the surrounding water, constituting the so-called “plastisphere.” Comparable studies in terrestrial environments are scarce. Here, we aimed to characterize the plastisphere microbiome of three types of plastics differing in their biodegradability in soil using DNA metabarcoding. Polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), and polyethylene (PE) were buried in two different soils, from the Swiss Alps and from Northern Greenland, at 15°C for 8 weeks. While physico-chemical characteristics of the polymers only showed minor (PLA, PBAT) or no (PE) changes after incubation, a considerably lower α-diversity was observed on the plastic surfaces and prominent shifts occurred in the bacterial and fungal community structures between the plastisphere and the adjacent bulk soil not affected by the plastic. Effects on the plastisphere microbiome increased with greater biodegradability of the plastics, from PE to PLA. Copiotrophic taxa within the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria benefitted the most from plastic input. Especially taxa with a known potential to degrade xenobiotics, including Burkholderiales, Caulobacterales, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Streptomyces, thrived in the plastisphere of the Alpine and Arctic soils. In addition, Saccharimonadales (superphylum Patescibacteria) was identified as a key taxon associated with PLA. The association of Saccharibacteria with plastic has not been reported before, and pursuing this finding further may shed light on the lifestyle of this obscure candidate phylum. Plastic addition affected fungal taxa to a lesser extent since only few fungal genera such as Phlebia and Alternaria were increased on the plastisphere. Our findings suggest that the soil microbiome can be strongly influenced by plastic pollution in terrestrial cryoenvironments. Further research is required to fully understand microbial colonization on plastic surfaces and the biodegradation of plastic in soils. © Copyright © 2020 Rüthi, Bölsterli, Pardi-Comensoli, Brunner and Frey.},

  abstract={Although microorganisms are the very first colonizers of recently deglaciated soils even prior to plant colonization, the drivers and patterns of microbial community succession at early-successional stages remain poorly understood. The successional dynamics and assembly processes of bacterial and fungal communities were compared on a glacier foreland in the maritime Antarctic across the ~10-year soil-age gradient from bare soil to sparsely vegetated area. Bacterial communities shifted more rapidly than fungal communities in response to glacial retreat; species turnover (primarily the transition from glacier- to soil-favouring taxa) contributed greatly to bacterial beta diversity, but this pattern was less clear in fungi. Bacterial communities underwent more predictable (more deterministic) changes along the soil-age gradient, with compositional changes paralleling the direction of changes in soil physicochemical properties following deglaciation. In contrast, the compositional shift in fungal communities was less associated with changes in deglaciation-induced changes in soil geochemistry and most fungal taxa displayed mosaic abundance distribution across the landscape, suggesting that the successional dynamics of fungal communities are largely governed by stochastic processes. A co-occurrence network analysis revealed that biotic interactions between bacteria and fungi are very weak in early succession. Taken together, these results collectively suggest that bacterial and fungal communities in recently deglaciated soils are largely decoupled from each other during succession and exert very divergent trajectories of succession and assembly under different selective forces. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

  abstract={Polar regions are characterized by rocky terrains with sparse vegetation and oligotrophic soils, i.e. “fellfields”. In such ecosystems, microbial communities should be essential for soil-plant functioning but their diversity is poorly explored. The sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands fellfields are characterized by an endemic long-lived cushion plant, Lyallia kerguelensis which rhizosphere may be a shelter for microbes in this harsh environment. Cushions are affected by necrosis and we expect the rhizomicrobiome composition to be related to plant necrosis. We analysed bacterial and fungal communities in bulk- and rhizospheric soils from L. kerguelensis in five different fellfields across the Kerguelen Islands using 16S rRNA and ITS1 metabarcoding. We found that soil microbial communities were composed of both restricted and cosmopolitan taxa. While all sites were dominated by the same bacterial taxa (Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, α-Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria), the relative abundance of the main fungal phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota and Rozellomycota) highly differed between sites. L. kerguelensis rhizomicrobiome was at least as diverse as the bulk soil, making the rhizosphere a possible reservoir of microbial diversity. It was composed of the same main bacterial phyla than detected in the bulk soil while the composition of the rhizosphere fungal communities was specific to each plant. No common microorganisms were identified regarding cushion necrosis extent across plants and sites, but several microbial putative functions were shared, suggesting a possible shift in soil functioning with cushion necrosis increase. Our study brings new information on the diversity and composition of the microbial communities of fellfield soils in a sub-Antarctic Island and the rhizomicrobiome of a characteristic endemic cushion plant.

  abstract={Background: Tall deciduous shrubs are increasing in range, size and cover across much of the Arctic, a process commonly assumed to increase carbon (C) storage. Major advances in remote sensing have increased our ability to monitor changes aboveground, improving quantification and understanding of arctic greening. However, the vast majority of C in the Arctic is stored in soils, where changes are more uncertain. Scope: We present pilot data to argue that shrub expansion will cause changes in rhizosphere processes, including the development of new mycorrhizal associations that have the potential to promote soil C losses that substantially exceed C gains in plant biomass. However, current observations are limited in their spatial extent, and mechanistic understanding is still developing. Extending measurements across different regions and tundra types would greatly increase our ability to predict the biogeochemical consequences of arctic vegetation change, and we present a simple method that would allow such data to be collected. Conclusions: Shrub expansion in the Arctic could promote substantial soil C losses that are unlikely to be offset by increases in plant biomass. However, confidence in this prediction is limited by a lack of information on how soil C stocks vary between contrasting Arctic vegetation communities; this needs to be addressed urgently. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Establishing robust estimates of polar marine biodiversity is important for interpreting future changes in the Arctic; however, despite a recent increase in scientific expeditions, this region remains relatively underexplored. Particularly overlooked in biodiversity assessments are small species, such as protists, fungi, and many small invertebrates that are collectively known as meiofauna. These species contribute to the foundation of food webs and are crucial for the survival of larger species that are economically and socially important. The application of high-throughput sequencing methodologies has proven effective for biomonitoring small metazoan species but has sparingly been applied in the Arctic. We used a metabarcoding approach to assess the diversity of sea ice and sediment-associated metazoans from Utqiaġvik (Barrow), Alaska. Sea ice and sediment samples were collected six times over eight months (January through August) encompassing three seasons (winter, spring, and summer) from polar night to ice-out in August. Biodiversity was assessed as both richness and community composition by incorporating incidence data and phylogenetic distance. Environmental conditions associated with ice, sediment, water, and snow were measured and tested for possible correlations with biodiversity estimates. We found a high number of taxa distributed locally, suggesting that metabarcoding can be effectively applied to Arctic biomonitoring programs. In addition, these results show that season and habitat are significant predictors of meiofaunal biodiversity, supporting hypotheses that meiofauna can be used as a valuable indicator of climate change. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Cladosporium antarcticum produced two major products from drimendiol, identified as 9α-hydroxydrimendiol (1, 41.4 mg, 19.4% yield) and 3β-hydroxydrimendiol (2, 74.8 mg, 35% yield), whereas the biotransformation of epidrimendiol yielded only one product, 9β-hydroxyepidrimendiol (3, 86.6 mg, 41.6% yield). The products were purified by column chromatography and their structure elucidated by NMR and MS. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–3 was analyzed against Candida albicans, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, showing that compound 2 has a MIC lower than 15 µg/mL against the three-pathogenic yeast. In silico studies suggest that a possible mechanism of action for the novel compounds is the inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, affecting the ergosterol synthesis. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={The arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is the only native terrestrial mammal in Iceland. While red foxes (V. vulpes) are known to be epidemiologically important carriers of several vector-borne pathogens in Europe, arctic foxes have never been evaluated in a similar context on this continent. This has become especially relevant in the last decade, considering the establishing populations of the tick species Ixodes ricinus in Iceland. In this study, liver DNA extracts of 60 arctic foxes, hunted between 2011–2012, were molecularly screened for vector-borne protozoan parasites (Trypanosomatidae, Babesia, Theileria, Hepatozoon) and bacteria (Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, Borrelia, hemotropic Mycoplasma). One sample was real-time qPCR positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, though this positivity could not be confirmed with sequencing. Samples were negative for all other tested vector-borne pathogens. Results of this study indicate that, except for A. phagocytophilum, Icelandic arctic foxes were apparently “not yet infected” with vector-borne pathogens in 2011–2012, or their infections were “below the detection limit” of applied methods. Taking into account the broad range of target microorganisms analyzed here, as well as the warming climate and increasing presence of the vector I. ricinus in Iceland, our results will be very useful as baseline data for comparison in future monitoring of the emergence of ticks and tick-borne diseases in this country. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract={Background: In the ice-free area of maritime Antarctica, fungi are the essential functioning group in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Until now, no study has been conducted to comprehensively assess fungal communities in various habitats in Antarctica. We aimed to characterize fungal communities in the eleven habitats (i.e., soil, seawater, vascular plant, dung, moss, marine alga, lichen, green alga, freshwater, feather) in the Fildes Region (maritime Antarctica) using next-generation sequencing. Results: A total of 12 known phyla, 37 known classes, 85 known orders, 164 known families, 313 known genera, and 320 known species were detected. Habitat specificity rather than habitat overlap determined the composition of fungal communities, suggesting that, although fungal communities were connected by dispersal at the local scale, the environmental filter is a key factor driving fungal assemblages in the ice-free Antarctica. Furthermore, 20 fungal guilds and 6 growth forms were detected. Many significant differences in the functional guild (e.g., lichenized, algal parasite, litter saprotroph) and growth form (e.g., yeast, filamentous mycelium, thallus photosynthetic) existed among different habitat types. Conclusion: The present study reveals the high diversity of fungal communities in the eleven ice-free Antarctic habitats and elucidates the ecological traits of fungal communities in this unique ice-free area of maritime Antarctica. The findings will help advance our understanding of fungal diversity and their ecological roles with respect to habitats on a neighbourhood scale in the ice-free area of maritime Antarctica. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={The climate of maritime Antarctica has altered since the 1950s. However, the effects of increased temperature, precipitation and organic carbon and nitrogen availability on the fungal communities inhabiting the barren and oligotrophic fellfield soils that are widespread across the region are poorly understood. Here, we test how warming with open top chambers (OTCs), irrigation and the organic substrates glucose, glycine and tryptone soy broth (TSB) influence a fungal community inhabiting an oligotrophic maritime Antarctic fellfield soil. In contrast with studies in vegetated soils at lower latitudes, OTCs increased fungal community alpha diversity (Simpson’s index and evenness) by 102–142% in unamended soil after 5 years. Conversely, OTCs had few effects on diversity in substrate-amended soils, with their only main effects, in glycine-amended soils, being attributable to an abundance of Pseudogymnoascus. The substrates reduced alpha and beta diversity metrics by 18–63%, altered community composition and elevated soil fungal DNA concentrations by 1–2 orders of magnitude after 5 years. In glycine-amended soil, OTCs decreased DNA concentrations by 57% and increased the relative abundance of the yeast Vishniacozyma by 45-fold. The relative abundance of the yeast Gelidatrema declined by 78% in chambered soil and increased by 1.9-fold in irrigated soil. Fungal DNA concentrations were also halved by irrigation in TSB-amended soils. In support of regional- and continental-scale studies across climatic gradients, the observations indicate that soil fungal alpha diversity in maritime Antarctica will increase as the region warms, but suggest that the accumulation of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds in fellfield soils arising from expanding plant populations are likely, in time, to attenuate the positive effects of warming on diversity.

These physiological adaptations can result in the production of unique secondary metabolites with potential biotechnological applications. The current study presents a genetic and antibacterial characterization of four Antarctic fungi isolated from soil samples collected in Pedro Vicente Maldonado Scientific Station, at Fort William Point, Greenwich Island, Antarctica. Based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the fungi were identified as Antarctomyces sp., Thelebolus sp., Penicillium sp., and Cryptococcus gilvescens. The antibacterial activity was assessed against four clinical bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, by a modified bacterial growth inhibition assay on agar plates. Results showed that C. gilvescens and Penicillium sp. have potential antibiotic activity against all bacterial strains. Interestingly, Thelebolus sp. showed potential antibiotic activity only against E. coli. In contrast, Antarctomyces sp. did not show antibiotic activity against any of the bacteria tested under our experimental conditions. This study highlights the importance of conservation of Antarctica as a source of metabolites with important biomedical applications. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Ambrosia beetles from the scolytine tribe Xyleborini (Curculionidae) are important to the decomposition of woody plant material on every continent except Antarctica. These insects farm fungi on the walls of tunnels they build inside recently dead trees and rely on the fungi for nutrition during all stages of their lives. Such ambrosia fungi rely on the beetles to provide appropriate substrates and environmental conditions for growth. A small minority of xyleborine ambrosia beetle–fungal partnerships cause significant damage to healthy trees. The xyleborine beetle Coptoborus ochromactonus vectors a Fusarium (Hypocreales) fungus that is lethal to balsa (Ochroma pyramidale (Malvaceae)) trees in Ecuador. Although this pathogenic fungus and its associated beetle are not known to be established in the United States, several other non-native ambrosia beetle species are vectors of destructive plant diseases in this country. This fact and the acceleration of trade between South America and the United States demonstrate the importance of understanding fungal plant pathogens before they escape their native ranges. Here we identify the fungi accompanying Coptoborus ambrosia beetles collected in Ecuador. Classification based ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS) sequences revealed the most prevalent fungi associated with Coptoborus are Fusarium sp. and Graphium sp. (Microascales: Microascaceae), which have been confirmed as ambrosia fungi for xyleborine ambrosia beetles, and Clonostsachys sp. (Hypocreales), which is a diverse genus found abundantly in soils and associated with plants. Phylogenetic analyses of the Fusarium strains based on ITS, translation elongation factor (EF1-α), and two subunits of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2) identified them as Fusarium sp. AF-9 in the Ambrosia Fusarium Clade (AFC). This Fusarium species was previously associated with a few xyleborine ambrosia beetles, most notably the species complex Euwallacea fornicatus (Eichhoff 1868) (Curculionidae: Scolytinae: Xyleborini). Examination of ITS and EF1-α sequences showed a close affinity between the Graphium isolated from Coptoborus spp. and other xyleborine-associated Graphium as well as the soil fungus Graphium basitruncatum. This characterization of ambrosia fungi through DNA sequencing confirms the identity of a putative plant pathogen spread by Coptoborus beetles and expands the documented range of Fusarium and Graphium ambrosia fungi. © 2022 The Mycological Society of America.},

  abstract={Plant-fungi interactions have been identified as fundamental drivers of the plant host performance, particularly in cold environments where organic matter degradation rates are slow, precisely for the capacity of the fungal symbiont to enhance the availability of labile nitrogen (N) in the plant rhizosphere. Nevertheless, these positive effects appear to be modulated by the composition and amount of the N pool in the soil, being greater when plant hosts are growing where N is scarce as is the case of Antarctic soils. Nevertheless, in some coastal areas of this continent, seabirds and marine mammal colonies exert, through their accumulated feces and urine a strong influence on the edaphic N content surrounding their aggregation points. To evaluate if the fungal symbionts (root endophytes), associated to the only two Antarctic vascular plants Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, act as N-uptake enhancers, even in such N-rich conditions as those found around animal influence, we assessed, under controlled conditions, the process of N mineralization in soil by the accumulation of NH4+ in the rizhosphere and the biomass accumulation of plants with (E+) and without (E−) fungal symbionts. Complementarily, taking advantage of the isotopic N-fractionation that root-fungal symbionts exert on organic N molecules during its acquisition process, we also determined if endophytes actively participate in the Antarctic plants N-uptake, when inorganic N is not a limiting factor, by estimating the δ15N isotopic signatures in leaves. Overall, symbiotic interaction increased the availability of NH4+ in the rhizosphere of both species. As expected, the enhanced availability of inorganic N resulted in a higher final biomass in E + compared with E− plants of both species. In addition, we found that the positive role of fungal symbionts was also actively linked to the process of N-uptake in both species, evidenced by the contrasting δ15N signatures present in E+ (−0.4 to −2.3‰) relative to E− plants (2.7–3.1‰). In conclusion, despite being grown under rich N soils, the two Antarctic vascular plants showed that the presence of root-fungal endophytes, furthermore enhanced the availability of inorganic N sources in the rhizosphere, has a positive impact in their biomass, remarking the active participation of these endophytes in the N-uptake process for plants inhabiting the Antarctic continent. © Copyright © 2020 Acuña-Rodríguez, Galán, Torres-Díaz, Atala and Molina-Montenegro.},

  abstract={Psychrophilic fungi are a critical biotic component in cold deserts that serves a central role in nutrient recycling and biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological significance, culture-independent studies on psychrophilic mycobiome are limited. In the present study, the fungal diversity patterns across the Drass, an Indian cold desert in the Himalaya, were indexed by targeted amplicon pyrosequencing (ITS). In the Drass dataset, Ascomycota was represented by 92 genera, while 22 genera represented Basidiomycota. The most abundant genus was Conocybe (20.46%). Most of the identified genera were reported in the literature to be prolific extracellular hydrolytic enzyme producers. To identify whether the Drass fungal assemblages share similarities to other cold deserts, these were further compared to Antarctic and Arctic cold deserts. Comparative analysis across the three cold deserts indicated the dominance of Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The observed alpha diversity, Shannon index as well as Pielou's evenness was highest in the Antarctic followed by Drass and Arctic datasets. The genera Malassezia, Preussia, Pseudogymnoascus, Cadophora, Geopora, Monodictys, Tetracladium, Titaea, Mortierella, and Cladosporium were common to all the cold deserts. Furthermore, Conocybe was represented predominantly in Drass. Interestingly, the genus Conocybe has not been previously reported from any other studies on Antarctic or Arctic biomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fungal metagenome study in Drass soil. Our analysis shows that despite the similarities of low temperature among the cold deserts, a significant differential abundance of fungal communities prevails in the global cold deserts. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={The identification of traces of life beyond Earth (e.g., Mars, icy moons) is a challenging task because terrestrial chemical-based molecules may be destroyed by the harsh conditions experienced on extraterrestrial planetary surfaces. For this reason, studying the effects on biomolecules of extremophilic microorganisms through astrobiological ground-based space simulation experiments is significant to support the interpretation of the data that will be gained and collected during the ongoing and future space exploration missions. Here, the stability of the biomolecules of the cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus, grown on two Martian regolith analogues and on Antarctic sandstone, were analysed through a metabolomic approach, after its exposure to Science Verification Tests (SVTs) performed in the frame of the European Space Agency (ESA) Biology and Mars Experiment (BIOMEX) project. These tests are building a set of ground-based experiments performed before the space exposure aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The analysis aimed to investigate the effects of different mineral mixtures on fungal colonies and the stability of the biomolecules synthetised by the fungus under simulated Martian and space conditions. The identification of a specific group of molecules showing good stability after the treatments allow the creation of a molecular database that should support the analysis of future data sets that will be collected in the ongoing and next space exploration missions.

  abstract={Iron is the fourth most abundant element on earth. However, its low bioavailability is a key plant-growth limiting factor. Bacteria play an important role in plant growth promotion since they produce specific secondary metabolites that may increase macro- and micronutrient accessibility in soil. Therefore, bacterial-derived iron chelators, as well as surface-active compounds, are recognised as essential to plant welfare. In this study, three cold-active Antarctic bacterial strains, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H12B, Psychrobacter sp. ANT_H59 and Bacillus sp. ANT_WA51, were analysed. The physiological and genomic characterisation of these strains revealed their potential for plant growth promotion, reflected in the production of various biomolecules, including biosurfactants (that may lower the medium surface tension of even up to 53%) and siderophores (including ANT_H12B-produced mixed-type siderophore that demonstrated the highest production, reaching the concentration of up to 1.065 mM), increasing the availability of nutrients in the environment and neutralising fungal pathogens. Tested bacteria demonstrated an ability to promote the growth of a model plant, alfalfa, increasing shoots’ length and fresh biomass even up to 26 and 46% respectively; while their metabolites increased the bioavailability of iron in soil up to 40%. It was also revealed that the introduced strains did not disrupt physicochemical conditions and indigenous soil microbial composition, which suggests that they are promising amendments preserving the natural biodiversity of soil and increasing its fertility.

  abstract={Previous studies have shown changes to the frequencies of hyphal coils and other fungal structures in leafy liverwort tissues across latitudinal transects through Antarctica. Although suggestive of a role of temperature in determining the frequencies of fungal structures, these studies could not exclude the possibility that other factors which alter at lower latitudes—notably liquid water availability—were responsible for the observed patterns of fungal colonisation. Here, in a field experiment in maritime Antarctica, the effects of warming with open top chambers (OTCs) on the frequencies of fungal structures in the leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians were determined. At five samplings of the experiment taking place 5–10 years after its deployment, OTCs, which increased the summertime temperature of C. varians mats by 1.1 °C, but had no measurable effects on mat moisture concentration, were found to double the frequencies of fine hyphal coils in liverwort tissues. Over the duration of the experiment, the OTCs also significantly increased the frequency of rhizoids on C. varians stems, but had no effects on the frequencies of coarse hyphal coils, dark septate hyphae, hyaline septate hyphae, or hyphal colonisation of rhizoids. Given that C. varians can be recovered from frozen peatbank cores, it is proposed that the abundance of fine hyphal coils in its tissues might be used as a signal of recent climate warming on the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={The human movement to and from Antarctica has increased significantly in recent decades, particularly to the South Shetland Islands, King George Island (KGI), and Deception Island (DCI). Such movements may result in unintentional soil transfer to other warmer regions, such as tropical countries. However, the ability of Antarctic bacteria to survive in tropical climates remained unknown. Hence, the objectives of this work were (i) to determine the bacterial diversity of the soils at the study sites on the two islands, and (ii) to determine if simulated tropical-like growth climate conditions would impact overall diversity and increase the abundance of potentially harmful bacteria in the Antarctic soils. KGI and DCI soils were incubated for 12 months under simulated tropical conditions. After 6 and 12-months, samples were collected and subjected to metagenomic DNA extraction, 16S rDNA amplification, sequencing, and alignment analysis. The 12-month denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed changes in fingerprinting patterns and bacterial diversity indices. Following that, bacterial diversity analyses for KGI and DCI soils were undertaken using V3-V4 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Major bacterial phyla in KGI and DCI soils comprised Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Except for Proteobacteria in KGI soils and Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi in DCI soils, most phyla in both soils did not acclimate to simulated tropical conditions. Changes in diversity were also observed at the genus level, with Methylobacterium spp. predominating in both soils after incubation. After the 12-month incubation, the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium, Massilia, and Williamsia spp. increased. Overall, there was a loss of bacterial diversity in both Antarctic soils after 12 months, indicating that most bacteria from both islands sampling sites cannot survive well if the soils were accidentally transported into warmer climates.  © 2022.

  abstract={Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are communities of bryophytes, lichens, bacteria, and fungi and are the primary colonizing communities in early successional landscapes. In early ecosystem development BSCs often improve the physical and chemical conditions while also promoting soil microbial communities. Although BSCs are considered ecosystem engineers in many early successional environments, the links between BSC functional processes and their developmental stage are unclear, especially in landscapes recovering from anthropogenic disturbances. In this study we examined natural BSC development over a 30-year chronosequence on two mining impacted landscapes in both boreal and arctic regions of Canada. Using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS), we found similar ubiquitous ruderal bryophytes and bacteria species common at both study areas, but significant differences in lichen and fungal community structure between the two locations. In addition, community assembly of BSC macro (bryophytes and lichens) and micro (bacteria and fungi)-phyla changed over the first 30 years of recovery at both mine sites, however, these changes were unique to each study location. We observed nutrient accumulation in the crust layer but did not find clear trends in available nutrients or gas flux over time. Instead, changes in our functional measurements were associated with colonization by specific BSC species. Further, the bacterial community at both mines seemed to be responding to changes in the bryophyte communities as they developed over time. This suggests that the establishment of bryophyte communities in early succession may be driving micro-phyla BSC community composition. A holistic view of BSCs as they develop over time in relation to their functional abilities needs further investigation, and this study provides insight into these interactions. This knowledge will improve both our understanding of early stage BSC development and our ability to develop restoration techniques to effectively restore landscapes disturbed by anthropogenic activities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Lichens are present in most terrestrial ecosystems on Earth and colonize extreme habitats, where vascular plants are unable to thrive, due to unique properties of the fungal-algal symbiosis. Here, we explored the phylogeographic structure of green algae engaged in symbiosis with species in the genus Pseudephebe (Parmeliaceae). These often form deep brown to blackish fruticose thalli on acidic rocks, and have partially overlapping distributions: P. minuscula is bipolar and co-occurs with P. pubescens in Europe. Based on a broad sampling, including the Arctic and Antarctica, we focused on photobionts (1) to identify genetic lineages and their phylogenetic assignment, (2) to infer the haplotype distribution in relation with geography and the mycobiont’s identity, and (3) to evaluate spatial genetic structure and polymorphism. Results revealed three Trebouxia clade S lineages (Trebouxia S02, T. suecica and T. angustilobata) associated to Pseudephebe species, with predominant haplotypes distributed throughout the entire geographic distribution, and some, less frequent, shared between widely distant localities. Photobiont switching was evident in the Mediterranean region, and algal co-occurrence was frequent in both mycobionts, which shared the same set of photobionts; this could explain, at least partially, their overlapping distribution. Furthermore, genetic structure was influenced by geography given the substantial percentages of genetic variation (ca. 25–50%) explained by the different delimited eco−/biogeographic regions. In Continental Antarctica, mycobionts showed a high specialization towards the photobionts, which are probably endemic of this climatically extreme region. Taken together, our findings provide further insight about the processes shaping lichen biogeography. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

Our objective was to understand how rhizosphere bacterial communities from diverse Alaskan boreal and tundra habitats and common Alaskan plant species interact with an anthropogenic soil stressor. A variety of soil types associated with plant communities from Interior and Arctic Alaska were selected. Soils were seeded with a forb, grass, or tree, spiked with antimony (Sb) or kept as a control, and grown for 60 days under warm conditions. Plant growth and Sb uptake, rhizosphere prokaryote composition, and mycorrhizal colonization data were collected. Antimony altered rhizosphere bacterial community richness, diversity, and composition, dependent on soil type and plant identity. Of 20 rhizosphere bacterial orders, Burkholderiales proved most responsive to Sb, but the responses varied by plant species. Plant species' uptake of Sb were strongly influenced by soil biological, chemical, and physical properties. Picea glauca (white spruce) accumulated hyperaccumulator-level Sb concentrations in its roots in 2 of 6 soils. Future biotechnology applications to mitigate land degradation in this environment must acknowledge the complex interactions between vegetation, soils, microbes, and climate for successful utilization. © 2021},

  abstract={Northern peatlands, which are crucial reservoirs of carbon and nitrogen (415 ± 150 and 10 ± 7 Pg, respectively), are vulnerable to microbial mineralization after permafrost thaw. This study was carried out in four key sites containing northern permafrost peatland, which are located along the southern cryolithozone. The aim of this study is to characterize amino acids and the microbial community composition in peat strata along a climate gradient. Amino acids and microbiota diversity were studied by liquid chromatography and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The share of amino acid fragments was 2.6–7.8, and it is highly significantly correlated (r = 0.87, −0.74 and 0.67, p ˂ 0.05) with the organic nitrogen concentration in the soil, the C/N ratio, and δ15N. The data shows the existence of a large pool of microorganisms concentrated in permafrost peatlands, and a vertical continuum of bacteria, archaea, and microscopic fungi along the peat profile, due to the presence of microorganisms in each layer, throughout all the peat strata. There is no significant correlation between microorganism distribution and the plant macrofossil composition of the peat strata. Determining factors for the development of microorganism abundance are aeration and hydrothermal conditions. The availability of nitrogen will limit the ability of plants and microorganisms to respond to changing environmental conditions; however, with the increased decomposition of organic matter, amino acids will be released as organic sources of nitrogen stored in the protein material of peat-forming plants and microbial communities, which can also affect the organic nitrogen cycle. © 2022 by the authors.},

Bacterial strains (n = 281) were isolated at 15 °C using medium containing humic acids (HA), a principal component of HS, from a variety of polar soil samples: 217 from the Antarctic and 64 from the Arctic. We identified 73 potential HA-degrading bacteria based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity, and these sequences were affiliated with phyla Proteobacteria (73.9%), Actinobacteria (20.5%), and Bacteroidetes (5.5%). HA-degrading strains were further classified into the genera Pseudomonas (51 strains), Rhodococcus (10 strains), or others (12 strains). Most strains degraded HA between 10 and 25 °C, but not above 30 °C, indicating cold-adapted degradation. Thirty unique laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) gene fragments were PCR-amplified from 71% of the 73 HA-degrading bacterial strains, all of which included conserved copper-binding regions (CBR) I and II, both essential for laccase activity. Bacterial LMCO sequences differed from known fungal laccases; for example, a cysteine residue between CBR I and CBR II in fungal laccases was not detected in bacterial LMCOs. This suggests a bacterial biomarker role for LMCO to predict changes in HS-degradation rates in tundra regions as global climate changes. Computer-aided molecular modeling showed these LMCOs contain a highly-conserved copper-dependent active site formed by three histidine residues between CBR I and CBR II. Phylogenetic- and modeling-based methods confirmed the wide occurrence of LMCO genes in HA-degrading polar soil bacteria and linked their putative gene functions with initial HS-degradation processes. © 2021, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.},

  abstract={Bacteria associated with plants colonizing extreme environments in Chile (Atacama and Antarctic Desert soils) provide a model to study plant growth-promoting mechanisms that can be useful to improve the growth of crops such as Chenopodium quinoa Wild. (Amaranthaceae) growing under severe environmental conditions. This study aimed to determine the tolerance of extremophile rhizobacteria to multiple metal(loid)s and evaluate the effects of formulated consortia in seed germination and growth-promotion of C. quinoa. In our work, five rhizobacteria were isolated and classified into the bacteria genera Streptomyces, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. The five bacteria showed optimum growth at 26 °C, pH 6, and 1% NaCl. In addition, the isolated were resistant to arsenic, manganese, zinc, copper, chromium and showed plant growth-promoting traits, including indole acetic acid production, siderophores production, phosphate solubilization, ACC deaminase activity, and ammonia production. According to compatibility tests, three bacterial consortia were formulated: i) consortium A (Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. (T1B41)); ii) consortium B (Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. (B2B24)); and iii) consortium C (Streptomyces sp., Bacillus sp. (B2B24) and Bacillus sp. (T3B45)). In vitro antagonism against phytopathogenic fungi showed that Bacillus sp. (B2B24) and Bacillus sp. (T3B45) have a significant level of antagonism (up to 18.7 and 6.8%, respectively) and consortia were the most effective against B. cinerea (up to 100%). Consortia B and C significantly improved the germination rate (%) of C. quinoa seeds (86 ± 3.3 and 77 ± 1.7, respectively) and the number of leaves, wet stem weight, length stem length, wet root weight, and root diameter in the presence of metal(loid)s. Our results showed that rhizobacterial consortia based on extremophile microorganisms can enhance the growth of C. quinoa seedlings under metal(loid) stress, demonstrating beneficial characteristics that may be key in the early stages of development. © 2022},

Maximum CAT was demonstrated under low glucose content (2%), 10% inoculum size, temperature 20°C, and dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) 40%. An effective laboratory technology based on changing the oxidative stress level through an increase of DO in the bioreactor was developed. The used strategy resulted in a 1.7- and 1.4-fold enhanced total enzyme activity and maximum enzyme productivity. The enzyme was purified and characterized.

  abstract={During the evolution organisms are subjected to the continuous impact of environmental factors. In recent years an increasing number of studies have focused on the physicochemical limits of life on Earth such as temperature, pressure, drought, salt content, pH, heavy metals, etc. Extreme environmental conditions disrupt the most important interactions that support the function and structure of biomolecules. For this reason, organisms inhabiting extreme habitats have recently become of particularly great interest. Although filamentous fungi are an important part of the polar ecosystem, information about their distribution and diversity, as well as their adaptation mechanisms, is insufficient. In the present study, the fungal strain Penicillium griseofulvum isolated from an Antarctic soil sample was used as a study model. The fungal cellular response against short term exposure to low temperature was observed. Our results clearly showed that short-term low temperature exposure caused oxidative stress in fungal cells and resulted in enhanced level of oxidative damaged proteins, accumulation of reserve carbohydrates and increased activity of the antioxidant enzyme defence. Ultrastructural changes in cell morphology were analysed. Different pattern of cell pathology provoked by the application of two stress temperatures was detected. Overall, this study aimed to observe the survival strategy of filamentous fungi in extremely cold habitats, and to acquire new knowledge about the relationship between low temperature and oxidative stress.

  abstract={Due to the extensive use of plastics, their quantity in the environment is constantly increasing, which creates a global problem. In the present study, we sought to isolate, test and identify Antarctic microorganisms which possess the ability to biodegrade bioplastics such as poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA) at low temperatures. 161 bacterial and 38 fungal isolates were isolated from 22 Antarctic soil samples. Among them, 92.16% of bacterial and 77.27% of fungal isolates formed a clear zone on emulsified PBSA, 98.04% and 81.82% on PBS and 100% and 77.27% on PCL as an additive to minimal medium at 20 °C. Based on the 16S and 18S rRNA sequences, bacterial strains were identified as species belonging to Pseudomonas and Bacillus and fungal strains as species belonging to Geomyces, Sclerotinia, Fusarium and Mortierella, while the yeast strain was identified as Hansenula anomala. In the biodegradation process conducted under laboratory conditions at 14, 20 and 28 °C, Sclerotinia sp. B11IV and Fusarium sp. B3′M strains showed the highest biodegradation activity at 20 °C (49.68% for PBSA and 33.7% for PCL, 45.99% for PBSA and 49.65% for PCL, respectively). The highest biodegradation rate for Geomyces sp. B10I was noted at 14 °C (25.67% for PBSA and 5.71% for PCL), which suggested a preference for lower temperatures (at 20 °C the biodegradation rate was only 11.34% for PBSA, and 4.46% for PCL). These data showed that microorganisms isolated from Antarctic regions are good candidates for effective plastic degradation at low temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={We report a previously undescribed member of the Helotiales that is superabundant in soils at two maritime Antarctic islands under Antarctic Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.). High throughput sequencing showed that up to 92% of DNA reads, and 68% of RNA reads, in soils from the islands were accounted for by the fungus. Sequencing of the large subunit region of ribosomal (r)DNA places the fungus close to the Pezizellaceae, Porodiplodiaceae, and Sclerotiniaceae, with analyses of internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA indicating that it has affinities to previously unnamed soil and root fungi from alpine, cool temperate and Low Arctic regions. The fungus was found to be most frequent in soils containing C aged to 1,000–1,200 years before present. The relative abundances of its DNA and RNA reads were positively associated with soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations and δ13C values, with the relative abundance of its DNA being negatively associated with soil pH value. An isolate of the fungus produces flask-shaped phialides with a pronounced venter bearing masses of conidia measuring 4.5–6(7) × 1.8–2.5 μm, suggestive of anamorphic Chalara. Enzymatic studies indicate that the isolate strongly synthesizes the extracellular enzyme acid phosphatase, and also exhibits alkaline phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities. Ecophysiological measurements indicate optimal hyphal growth of the isolate at a pH of 4.2–4.5 and a water potential of −0.66 MPa. The isolate is a psychrotroph, exhibiting measureable hyphal growth at −2°C, optimal hyphal extension rate at 15°C and negligible growth at 25°C. It is proposed that the rising temperatures that are predicted to occur in maritime Antarctica later this century will increase the growth rate of the fungus, with the potential loss of ancient C from soils. Analyses using the GlobalFungi Database indicate that the fungus is present in cold, acidic soils on all continents. We advocate further studies to identify whether it is superabundant in soils under D. antarctica elsewhere in maritime Antarctica, and for further isolates to be obtained so that the species can be formally described. © Copyright © 2020 Newsham, Cox, Sands, Garnett, Magan, Horrocks, Dungait and Robinson.},

  abstract={In arctic ecosystems, climate change has increased plant productivity. As arctic carbon (C) stocks predominantly are located belowground, the effects of greater plant productivity on soil C storage will significantly determine the net sink/source potential of these ecosystems, but vegetation controls on soil CO2 efflux remain poorly resolved. In order to identify the role of canopy-forming species in belowground C dynamics, we conducted a girdling experiment with plots distributed across 1 km2 of treeline birch (Betula pubescens) forest and willow (Salix lapponum) patches in northern Sweden and quantified the contribution of canopy vegetation to soil CO2 fluxes and belowground productivity. Girdling birches reduced total soil CO2 efflux in the peak growing season by 53%, which is double the expected amount, given that trees contribute only half of the total leaf area in the forest. Root and mycorrhizal mycelial production also decreased substantially. At peak season, willow shrubs contributed 38% to soil CO2 efflux in their patches. Our findings indicate that C, recently fixed by trees and tall shrubs, makes a substantial contribution to soil respiration. It is critically important that these processes are taken into consideration in the context of a greening arctic because productivity and ecosystem C sequestration are not synonymous. © 2020 The Authors.

Samples were taken from coal mine spoil tips with different ages (formed, 10-years, 30-years and 50-years). Arctic tundra soils were used as the control. The indicators of change were the species composition, diversity level, dominant groups of species and isolate density of fungal communities. The harsh arctic conditions and the inhospitality of the rock substrate determined the relatively low diversity of microfungi. Only 15 species of microfungi were identified in the samples from formed spoil tip, while in the samples from 50-year-old tip the number of microfungi species increased to 29. The average density of microfungi (CFU/g) for all sampling depths of the coal mine spoil tips was low. But this indicator increased with the age of spoil tips. The density of microfungi isolates also increased with depth in the coal mine spoil tips. The composition of the dominant species of microfungi changed with the age of the spoil tips increased.

  abstract={Global warming is most pronounced in the Arctic region. Greenhouse gas (GHG) release from Arctic soils increase due to global warming. By this, the Arctic may change from currently being a carbon sink to a future source. To improve accurate predictions of future GHG release from Arctic soils, it is important to unravel factors controlling both the microbial community structure and activity. Soil microbial activity is important for Arctic greenhouse gas production, but depends on soil conditions such as salinity being increased by calcium (Ca) and decreased by amorphous silica (Si) potentially enhancing water availability. In the Arctic, climate changes may alter salinity by changing Si and Ca concentrations upon permafrost thaw as a result of global warming with Si potentially decreasing and Ca potentially increasing salinity. Here, we show that higher Si concentration increased and higher Ca concentrations decreased the microbial CO2 production for both a salt-poor and a salt-rich soil from Greenland. In the salt-rich soil, Si amendment increased CO2 production and the abundance of gram-negative bacteria. However, the bacterial community became dominated by spore-forming gram-positive Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The CO2 release from soils was directly affected by the abundance of bacteria and fungi, and their community structure. Our results highlight the importance of the soil Si and Ca concentration on organic carbon turnover by strongly changing microbial abundance and community structure, with consequences for CO2 release in the Arctic. Consequently, Ca and Si and their relation to Arctic soil microbial community structure has to be considered when estimating pan-Arctic carbon budgets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, 13 species of leafy liverwort from west Spitsbergen in the High Arctic are examined for the symbiosis using epifluores-cence microscopy and sequencing of fungal ribosomal (r)RNA genes amplified from plant tissues. Microscopy showed that intracellular hyphal coils, key indi-cators of the symbiosis, were frequent (>40% stem length colonized) in nine species of liverwort in the families Anastrophyllaceae, Lophoziaceae, Cephaloziellaceae, Cephaloziaceae and Scapaniaceae, with hyphae occurring frequently (>40% cells occupied) in the rhizoids of 10 species in the same fam-ilies. Dark septate hyphae, apparently formed by ascomycetes, were frequent on the stems of members of the Anastrophyllaceae, Cephaloziellaceae and Cephaloziaceae, and typically those growing on acidic mine tailings. Sequencing of fungal rRNA genes showed the presence of nine distinct groups (based on a 3% cut-off for ITS sequence divergence) of the basidiomycete Serendipita in the Anastrophyllaceae and Lophoziaceae, with ordinations and correlative analyses showing the presence of the genus to be positively associated with the frequency of hyphal coils, the occurrence of which was positively associated with edaphic factors (soil δ15N value and concentrations of moisture, nitrogen, car-bon and organic matter). We propose that the frequency of mycothalli in leafy liverworts on west Spitsbergen, which is an order of magnitude higher than at lower latitudes, may arise from benefits conferred by mycobionts on their hosts in the harsh environment of the High Arctic.

  abstract={Urbanization in the Arctic results in considerable and still poorly known environmental consequences. The effect of urbanization on soil microbiome—an ecosystem component highly sensi-tive to anthropogenic disturbance—remains overlooked for the Arctic region. The research compared chemical and microbial properties of the natural Podzol soils and urban soils of Murmansk—the largest Arctic city. Particular attention was given to the profile distribution, which is almost com-pletely ignored by most microbial studies. Soil microbiome was investigated by the quantitative indicators based on fluorescence microscopy (microbial biomass) and PCR real-time methods (amount of rRNA genes copies of archaea, bacteria, and fungi). The principal changes in urban soils’ properties compared to the natural references included a shift in pH and an increase in C and nutrients’ contents, especially remarkable for the subsoil. The numbers of rRNA genes copies of archaea, bacteria, and fungi in urban topsoils (106 –1010, 109 –1010, and 107 –109, respectively) were lower than in Podzol; however, the opposite pattern was shown for the subsoil. Similarly, the total microbial biomass in urban topsoils (0.55–0.75 mg g−1 ) was lower compared to the 1.02 mg g−1 in Podzols, while urban subsoil microbial biomass was 2–2.5 times higher than in the natural conditions. Both for urban and natural soils and throughout the profiles, fungi were dominated by mycelium forms; however, the ratios of mycelium–spores were lower, and the amount of thin mycelium was higher in urban soils than in natural Podzols. Urbanization in the Arctic altered soil morphological and chemical properties and created a new niche for microbial development in urban subsoils; its contribution to biodiversity and nutrient cycling promises to become increasingly important under projected climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={In the Arctic, fungal mycelial growth takes place mainly during the cold season and beginning of growing season. Climate change induced increases of cold season temperatures may, hence, benefit fungal growth and increase their abundance. This is of particular importance for parasitic fungi, which may significantly shape Arctic vegetation composition. Here, we studied two contrasting plant parasitic fungi’s occurrences (biotrophic Exobasidium hypogenum Nannf. on the vascular plant Cassiope tetragona (L.) D. Don., and necrotrophic Pythium polare Tojo, van West & Hoshino on the moss Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) Loeske) in response to increased snow depth, a method primarily used to increase cold season temperatures, after 7–13 years of snow manipulation in Adventdalen, Svalbard. We show that enhanced snow depth increased occurrences of both fungi tested here and indicate that increased fungal infections of host plants were at least partly respon-sible for decreases of host occurrences. Although bryophyte growth, in general, may be influenced by increased soil moisture and reduced competition from vascular plants, Pythium polare is likely enhanced by the combination of milder winter temperatures and moister environment provided by the snow. The relationships between host plants and fungal infection indicate ongoing processes involved in the dynamics of compositional adjustment to changing climate. © the author(s) or their institution(s).},

  abstract={Among the celestial bodies in the Solar System, Mars currently represents the main target for the search for life beyond Earth. However, its surface is constantly exposed to high doses of cosmic rays (CRs) that may pose a threat to any biological system. For this reason, investigations into the limits of resistance of life to space relevant radiation is fundamental to speculate on the chance of finding extraterrestrial organisms on Mars. In the present work, as part of the STARLIFE project, the responses of dried colonies of the black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus Culture Collection of Fungi from Extreme Environments (CCFEE) 515 to the exposure to accelerated iron (LET: 200 keV/µm) ions, which mimic part of CRs spectrum, were investigated. Samples were exposed to the iron ions up to 1000 Gy in the presence of Martian regolith analogues. Our results showed an extraordinary resistance of the fungus in terms of survival, recovery of metabolic activity and DNA integrity. These experiments give new insights into the survival probability of possible terrestrial-like life forms on the present or past Martian surface and shallow subsurface environments. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract={Permafrost-affected soil stores a significant amount of organic carbon. Identifying the biological constraints of soil organic matter transformation, e.g., the interaction of major soil microbial soil organic matter decomposers, is crucial for predicting carbon vulnerability in permafrost-af-fected soil. Fungi are important players in the decomposition of soil organic matter and often inter-act in various mutualistic relationships during this process. We investigated four different soil horizon types (including specific horizons of cryoturbated soil organic matter (cryoOM)) across different types of permafrost-affected soil in the Western Canadian Arctic, determined the composition of fungal communities by sequencing (Illumina MPS) the fungal internal transcribed spacer region, assigned fungal lifestyles, and by determining the co-occurrence of fungal network properties, identified the topological role of keystone fungal taxa. Compositional analysis revealed a significantly higher relative proportion of the litter saprotroph Lachnum and root-associated saprotroph Phialo-cephala in the topsoil and the ectomycorrhizal close-contact exploring Russula in cryoOM, whereas Sites 1 and 2 had a significantly higher mean proportion of plant pathogens and lichenized trophic modes. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed the lowest modularity and average path length, and highest clustering coefficient in cryoOM, which suggested a lower network resistance to environmental perturbation. Zi-Pi plot analysis suggested that some keystone taxa changed their role from generalist to specialist, depending on the specific horizon concerned, Cladophialophora in top-soil, saprotrophic Mortierella in cryoOM, and Penicillium in subsoil were classified as generalists for the respective horizons but specialists elsewhere. The litter saprotrophic taxon Cadophora finlandica played a role as a generalist in Site 1 and specialist in the rest of the sites. Overall, these results suggested that fungal communities within cryoOM were more susceptible to environmental change and some taxa may shift their role, which may lead to changes in carbon storage in permafrost-affected soil. © 2021 by the authors.

The environmental characteristics found in this region favor the development of extremophile microorganisms, which are poorly explored biotechnologically. In this context, this study aimed at selectively isolating fungi with potential for the bioremediation of a textile dye. A total of 11 filamentous fungi were isolated from Antarctic samples after incubation in Minimal Mineral medium with the addition of Sulphur Indigo Blue dye. The Antarctic-derived fungi were submitted to textile dye decolorization analysis and biomass production. Isolates LAMAI 2400 and LAMAI 2402 showed more than 90% of decolorization at 15 °C, whereas at 28 °C these isolates showed 81.86 and 98.89%, respectively. In general, the toxicity of the bioassays, evaluated using Cucumis sativus, was higher than in the control. Both isolates, LAMAI 2400 and LAMAI 2402, were identified as Penicillium cf. oxalicum and classified as mesophilic-psychrotolerant. This fungal species has rarely been reported in the Antarctic environments. The results presented herein indicate the potential of the fungi recovered from Antarctic marine sediments for bioremediation of textile dyes at low and moderate temperatures, broadening the perspectives in the field of Antarctic mycology. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

We assessed the use of glycine, a readily available C and N source, and cellulose, a long C-biopolymer, by prokaryotic and fungal communities using DNA-SIP in tundra soils incubated at 8 °C or 16 °C. Glycine addition contributed mainly to instantaneous microbial carbon use and priming of soil organic matter decomposition, particularly under elevated temperature. By contrast, cellulose was linked to the dominant and active microbial communities, with potential carbon stabilization in soils.

  abstract={Rock-dwelling fungi play critical ecological roles in drylands, including soil formation and nutrient cycling; however, we know very little about the identity, function and environmental preferences of these important organisms, and the mere existence of a consistent rock mycobiome across diverse arid regions of the planet remains undetermined. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of rock fungi and spatially associated soil communities, surveyed across 28 unique sites spanning four major biogeographic regions (North America, Arctic, Maritime and Continental Antarctica) including contrasting climates, from cold and hot deserts to semiarid drylands. We show that rocks support a consistent and unique mycobiome that was different from that found in surrounding soils. Lichenized fungi from class Lecanoromycetes were consistently indicative of rocks across contrasting regions, together with ascomycetous representatives of black fungi in Arthoniomycetes, Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes. In addition, compared with soil, rocks had a lower proportion of saprobes and plant symbiotic fungi. The main drivers structuring rock fungi distribution were spatial distance and, to a larger extent, climatic factors regulating moisture and temperature (i.e. mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation), suggesting that these paramount and unique communities might be particularly sensitive to increases in temperature and desertification.  © 2022 The Author(s).

We here studied the joint effects of plant species identity and elevation on AM fungal distribution and diversity. We sampled roots of 19 plant species in 18 locations in Northeast Greenland, using next generation sequencing to identify AM fungi. We studied the joint effect of plant species, elevation and selected abiotic conditions on AM fungal presence, richness and composition. We identified 29 AM fungal virtual taxa (VT), of which six represent putatively new VT. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal presence increased with elevation, and as vegetation cover and the active soil layer decreased. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal composition was shaped jointly by elevation and plant species identity. We demonstrate that the Arctic harbours a relatively species-rich and nonrandomly distributed diversity of AM fungi. Given the high diversity and general lack of knowledge exposed herein, we encourage further research into the diversity, drivers and functional role of AM fungi in the Arctic.

  abstract={Climatically extreme regions such as the polar deserts of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (78° S) in Continental Antarctica are key areas for a better understanding of changes in ecosystems. Therefore, it is particularly important to analyze and communicate current patterns of biodiversity in these sensitive areas, where precipitation mostly occurs in form of snow and liquid water is rare. Humidity provided by dew, clouds, and fog are the main water sources, especially for rock-dwelling crustose lichens as one of the most common vegetation-forming organisms. We investigated the diversity and interaction specificity of myco-/photobiont associations of 232 crustose lichen specimens, collected along an elevational gradient (171–959 m a.s.l.) within the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The mycobiont species and photobiont OTUs were identified by using three markers each (nrITS, mtSSU, RPB1, and nrITS, psbJ-L, COX2). Elevation, positively associated with water availability, turned out to be the key factor explaining most of the distribution patterns of the mycobionts. Pairwise comparisons showed Lecidea cancriformis and Rhizoplaca macleanii to be significantly more common at higher elevations and Carbonea vorticosa and Lecidea polypycnidophora at lower elevations. Lichen photobionts were dominated by the globally distributed Trebouxia OTU, Tr_A02 which occurred at all habitats. Network specialization resulting from myco-/photobiont bipartite network structure varied with elevation and associated abiotic factors. Along an elevational gradient, the spatial distribution, diversity, and genetic variability of the lichen symbionts appear to be mainly influenced by improved water relations at higher altitudes. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This study investigates evolutionary community structure within the beetle (Coleoptera) families of Churchill and tests whether biological traits have played a role in governing colonization patterns from refugial and southerly geographic regions. This study quantifies sub-Arctic beetle phylogenetic community structure for each family using the net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest taxon index (NTI), calculated using publicly available data from the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD); compares patterns across families with different traits (habitat, diet) using standard statistical analysis (ANOVA) as well as phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) using a family-level beetle phylogeny obtained from the literature; and compares community structure in Churchill with a region in southern Canada (Guelph, Ontario). These analyses were also repeated at a genus level. The dominant pattern detected in our study was that aquatic families were much better represented in Churchill compared to terrestrial families, when compared against richness sampled from across Canada and Alaska. Individually, most families showed significant phylogenetic clustering in Churchill, likely due to the strong environmental filtering present in Arctic environments. There was no significant difference in phylogenetic structure between Churchill and Guelph but with a trend toward stronger clustering in the North. Fungivores were significantly more overdispersed than other feeding modes, predators were significantly more clustered, and aquatic families showed significantly stronger clustering compared to terrestrial.

  abstract={The arctic tundra is undergoing climate-driven changes and there are serious concerns related to the future of arctic biodiversity and altered ecological processes under possible climate change scenarios. Arctic land surface temperatures and precipitation are predicted to increase further, likely causing major transformation in terrestrial ecosystems. As a response to increasing temperatures, shifts in vegetation and soil fungal communities have already been observed. Little is known, however, how long-term experimental warming coupled with increased snow depth influence the trajectories of soil fungal communities in different tundra types. We compared edaphic variables and fungal community composition in experimental plots simulating the expected increase in summer warming and winter snow depth, based on DNA metabarcoding data. Fungal communities in the sampled dry and moist acidic tundra communities differed greatly, with tundra type explaining ca. one-third of compositional variation. Furthermore, dry and moist tundra appear to have different trajectories in response to climate change. Specifically, while both warming and increased snow depth had significant effects on fungal community composition and edaphic variables in dry tundra, the effect of increased snow was greater. However, in moist tundra, fungal communities mainly were affected by summer warming, while increased snow depth had a smaller effect and only on some functional groups. In dry tundra, microorganisms generally are limited by moisture in the summer and extremely low temperatures in winter, which is in agreement with the stronger effect of increased snow depth relative to warming. On the contrary, moist tundra soils generally are saturated with water, remain cold year-round and show relatively small seasonal fluctuations in temperature. The greater observed effect of warming on fungi in moist tundra may be explained by the narrower temperature optimum compared to those in dry tundra. © Copyright © 2021 Geml, Morgado and Semenova-Nelsen.},

  abstract={Biotechnologies based on microbial species capable of destroying harmful pollutants are a successful way to solve some of the most important problems associated with a clean environment. The subject of investigation is the Antarctic fungal strain Aspergillus glaucus AL1. The culturing of the examined strain was performed with 70 mg of wet mycelium being inoculated in a Czapek Dox liquid medium containing naphthalene, anthracene, or phenanthrene (0.3 g/L) as the sole carbon source. Progressively decreasing naphthalene and anthracene concentrations were monitored in the culture medium until the 15th day of the cultivation of A. glaucus AL1. The degradation was determined through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Both decreased by 66% and 44%, respec-tively, for this period. The GC-MS analyses were applied to identify salicylic acid, catechol, and ketoadipic acid as intermediates in the naphthalene degradation. The intermediates identified in anthracene catabolism are 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid, o-phthalic acid, and protocatechuic acid. The enzyme activities for phenol 2-monooxygenase (1.14.13.7) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (1.13.11.1) were established. A gene encoding an enzyme with catechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity was identified and sequenced (GeneBank Ac. No KM360483). The recent study provides original data on the potential of an ascomycete’s fungal strain A. glaucus strain AL 1 to degrade naphthalene and anthracene. © 2022 by the authors.

Soils were artificially spiked with Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, and a combination of these REs according to the levels measured in Arctic soils from REs-polluted industrial sites. During the incubation period, microbial activities and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) formation were inhibited, and microbial quotient (qCO2) values were relatively high in the spiked soils indicating that more energy was used by microbes for maintenance under REs stress. Meanwhile, microbial metabolism was significantly restrained. Microbial Specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were reduced in RE spiked soils relative to the control, especially in the As- and multi-RE-spiked soils. The abundance of both fungi and bacteria was reduced in response to RE amendments by 14–24% and 1–55%, respectively. PLFA biomarkers indicated a shift in soil microbial community structure and activities influenced by REs, consequently having a negative effect on soil organic carbon degradation.

Several studies about microbial communities in Antarctica have been carried out, nevertheless, Antarctic microbiota is still partially unknown. Here we present a multidisciplinary study about sediments obtained by deposition during 4 years in which several approaches have been considered for their characterization. First, a physicochemical characterization, using ionic chromatography and mass spectrometry for the determination of most abundant ions (chloride and sulphate) and elements (mainly silicon), was conducted. In addition, the total microbial community was studied using a metataxonomical approach, revealing a bacterial community dominated by Proteobacteria and Thaumarchaeota as the main archaeal genera and a fungal community mainly composed by Aspergillaceae. Culture-dependent studies showed low microbial diversity, only achieving the isolation of Bacillus-related species, some of them thermophilic, and the isolation of common fungi of Aspergillus or Penicillium spp. Furthermore, diatoms were detected in the sediment and characterized attending to their morphological characteristics using scanning electron microscopy. The study reveals a high influence of the physicochemical conditions in the microbial populations and their distribution, offering valuable data on the interaction between the island and water microbiota. © 2021 by the authors.

  abstract={Background: Invasive plants may displace native species. This is the case for Poa annua, the only non-native plant species successfully established in Maritime Antarctica. Nonetheless, it is uncertain which factors drive the competitive success of P. annua in the harsh environmental conditions of the region. The ability of this plant species to establish novel mutualistic interactions with resident soil fungi may be crucial for its invasiveness. Such ability may be linked to the vertical transmission of fungal endophytes via seeds. Aims: We undertook a study to assess the role of seed fungal endophytes as promoters of the establishment and invasion of Poa annua in Maritime Antarctica. Methods: We explored the composition and diversity of fungal communities associated with different P. annua tissues (seeds, leaves and roots) and the soil. We also measured parameters including germination rate, above-ground biomass, reproductive structures, and the survival of invasive P. annua as well as of the native Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica grown from seeds with and without endophytes. Furthermore, we conducted inter- and intraspecific competition experiments among native and invasive plants, where chemically mediated plant-to-plant interference (allelopathy) and plant growth rate were measured to calculate a relative competition index. Results: We found that fungal endophyte taxa associated with P. annua tissues were very different from those in the soil. Fungal endophytes in P. annua differed among seed, root and shoot tissues, which suggests low transmission among different organs. The removal of endophytes from P. annua seeds was associated with reduced seed germination, plant growth and survivorship, while the competitive ability of P. annua (assessed by accumulated biomass) relative to native species, as well as levels of allelochemicals in soils, were higher in the presence of seed fungal endophytes. Conclusion: Our results suggest that fungal endophytes, maternally inherited through seeds, improve host fitness and may contribute to the invasive success of P. annua in Antarctica. © 2022 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract={Microbes are widely assumed to be capable of colonizing even the most challenging terrestrial surface environments on Earth given enough time. We would not expect to find surface soils uninhabited by microbes as soils typically harbor diverse microbial communities and viable microbes have been detected in soils exposed to even the most inhospitable conditions. However, if uninhabited soils do exist, we might expect to find them in Antarctica. We analyzed 204 ice-free soils collected from across a remote valley in the Transantarctic Mountains (84–85°S, 174–177°W) and were able to identify a potential limit of microbial habitability. While most of the soils we tested contained diverse microbial communities, with fungi being particularly ubiquitous, microbes could not be detected in many of the driest, higher elevation soils—results that were confirmed using cultivation-dependent, cultivation-independent, and metabolic assays. While we cannot confirm that this subset of soils is completely sterile and devoid of microbial life, our results suggest that microbial life is severely restricted in the coldest, driest, and saltiest Antarctic soils. Constant exposure to these conditions for thousands of years has limited microbial communities so that their presence and activity is below detectable limits using a variety of standard methods. Such soils are unlikely to be unique to the studied region with this work supporting previous hypotheses that microbial habitability is constrained by near-continuous exposure to cold, dry, and salty conditions, establishing the environmental conditions that limit microbial life in terrestrial surface soils. © 2021.

This is, in particular, necessary before developing the enzyme for industrial-scale production. In the present study, partially purified α-amylase was obtained from strains of Pseudogymnoascus sp. obtained from Antarctic and Arctic locations. Partially purified α-amylases from these polar fungi exhibited very similar characteristics, including being active at 15 °C, although having a small difference in optimum pH. Both fungal taxa are good candidates for the potential application of cold-active enzymes in biotechnological industries, and further purification and characterization steps are now required. The α-amylases from polar fungi are attractive in terms of industrial development because they are active at lower temperatures and acidic pH, thus potentially creating energy and cost savings. Furthermore, they prevent the production of maltulose, which is an undesirable by-product often formed under alkaline conditions. Psychrophilic amylases from the polar Pseudogymnoascus sp. investigated in the present study could provide a valuable future contribution to biotechnological applications. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Understanding microbial niche variability in polar regions can provide insights into the adaptive diversification of microbial lineages in extreme environments. Compositions of microbial communities in Arctic soils are well documented but a comprehensive multidomain diversity assessment of rocks remains insufficiently studied. In this study, we obtained two types of rocks (sandstone and limestone) and soils around the rocks in a high Arctic polar desert (Svalbard), and examined the compositions of archaeal, bacterial, fungal, and protistan communities in the rocks and soils. The microbial community structure differed significantly between rocks and soils across all microbial groups at higher taxonomic levels, indicating that Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Latescibacteria, Rokubacteria, Leotiomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Mortierellomycetes, Sarcomonadea, and Spirotrichea were more abundant in soils, whereas Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, FBP, Lecanoromycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Trebouxiophyceae, and Ulvophyceae were more abundant in rocks. Interestingly, fungal communities differed markedly between two different rock types, which is likely to be ascribed to the predominance of distinct lichen-forming fungal taxa (Verrucariales in limestone, and Lecanorales in sandstone). This suggests that the physical or chemical properties of rocks could be a major determinant in the successful establishment of lichens in lithic environments. Furthermore, the biotic interactions among microorganisms based on co-occurrence network analysis revealed that Polyblastia and Verrucaria in limestone, and Atla, Porpidia, and Candelariella in sandstone play an important role as keystone taxa in the lithic communities. Our study shows that even in niches with the same climate regime and proximity to each other, heterogeneity of edaphic and lithic niches can affect microbial community assembly, which could be helpful in comprehensively understanding the effects of niche on microbial assembly in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. © Copyright © 2021 Choe, Kim and Lee.},

Dormant propagules of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are thought to play an important role in seedling establishment in invasion fronts; however, propagule bank communities above the treeline are poorly understood in the Eurasian Arctic, where treelines are expected to advance under rapid climate change. To investigate the availability of EM fungal propagules, we collected 100 soil samples from Arctic tundra sites and applied bioassay experiments using Larix cajanderi as bait seedlings. We detected 11 EM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by obtaining entire ITS regions. Suillus clintonianus was the most frequently observed OTU, followed by Cenococcum geophilum and Sebacinales OTU1. Three Suillus and one Rhizopogon species were detected in the bioassay seedlings, indicating the availability of Larix-specific suilloid spores at least 30 km from the contemporary treeline. Spores of S. clintonianus and S. spectabilis remained infective after preservation for 14 mo and heat treatment at 60°C, implying the durability of the spores. Long-distance dispersal capability and spore resistance to adverse conditions may represent ecological strategies employed by suilloid fungi to quickly associate with emerging seedlings of compatible hosts in treeless habitats. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Soil Mn concentration, MASAT, C:N ratio, and pH value determined the taxonomic composition of the lichenised guild, and the relative abundance of the guild was best predicted by soil Mn concentration. There was a 3% decrease in the relative abundance of the saprotrophic fungal guild in the total community for each degree Celsius rise in air temperature, and the OTU richness of the guild, which accounted for 39% of the community, was negatively associated with Mn concentration. The taxonomic composition of the saprotrophic guild varied with MASAT, pH value, and Mn, NH4+-N, and SO42− concentrations. The richness of the yeast community, which comprised 3% of the total fungal community, was positively associated with soil K concentration, with its composition being determined by C:N ratio. In contrast with a similar study in the Arctic, the relative abundance and richness of lichenised fungi declined between 60°S and 69°S, with those of saprotrophic Agaricales also declining sharply in soils beyond 63°S. Basidiomycota, which accounted for 4% of reads, were much less frequent than in vegetated soils at lower latitudes, with the Ascomycota (70% of reads) being the dominant phylum. We conclude that the richness, relative abundance, and taxonomic composition of guilds and growth forms of maritime Antarctic soil fungi are influenced by air temperature and edaphic factors, with implications for the soils of the region as its climate changes during the 21st century. © Copyright © 2021 Newsham, Davey, Hopkins and Dennis.},

  abstract={Mineral extraction is known to affect soil fungi in polar environments, but it is unknown how long these effects persist. Here, by amplifying the internal transcribed spacer regions of rRNA genes in soil fungi, we compared soil fungal community in intact natural tundra with that in a nearby former coal mining area, abandoned 52 years previously, on Svalbard in the High Arctic. Compared with those in intact tundra, soils in the former mining area were more acidic and had lower plant coverage. Despite of similar diversity in the two areas, the fungal community was dominated by Basidiomycota in the intact tundra, but by Ascomycota in the former mining area. Ectomycorrhizal genera formed a major part of the tundra community, but were notably less abundant in the mining area. The principal variation among samples was soil pH. Surprisingly, network connectivity analysis indicated that the fungal community in the former mining area had greater network connectivity than that in the tundra area. Overall, the ecosystem in the former mining area has made only limited recovery towards the natural tundra state even after more than five decades. It is unclear whether the recovery of the fungal community is limited more by the low primary productivity, slow migration of fungi and plants, or slow changes in soil parameters. Our findings emphasize the susceptibility of polar ecosystems to disturbance, given their particularly slow recovery back towards the natural state. © 2022 Soil Science Society of China},

  abstract={Beneficial plant-associated microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes, are key partners that normally improve plant survival under different environmental stresses. It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species. © Copyright © 2021 Torres-Díaz, Valladares, Acuña-Rodríguez, Ballesteros, Barrera, Atala and Molina-Montenegro.},

  abstract={Arsenic (As) is commonly sequestered at the sediment–water interface (SWI) in mining-impacted lakes through adsorption and/or co-precipitation with authigenic iron (Fe)-(oxy)hydroxides or sulfides. The results of this study demonstrate that the accumulation of organic matter (OM) in near-surface sediments also influences the mobility and fate of As in sub-Arctic lakes. Sediment gravity cores, sediment grab samples, and porewaters were collected from three lakes downstream of the former Tundra gold mine, Northwest Territories, Canada. Analysis of sediment using combined micro-X-ray fluorescence/diffraction, K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES), and organic petrography shows that As is associated with both aquatic (benthic and planktonic alginate) and terrestrially derived OM (e.g., cutinite, funginite). Most As is hosted by fine-grained Fe-(oxy)hydroxides or sulfide minerals (e.g., goethite, orpiment, lepidocrocite, and mackinawite); however, grain-scale synchrotron-based analysis shows that As is also associated with amorphous OM. Mixed As oxidation states in porewater (median = 62% As (V), 18% As (III); n = 20) and sediment (median = 80% As (-I) and (III), 20% As (V); n = 9) indicate the presence of variable redox conditions in the near-surface sediment and suggest that post-depositional remobilization of As has occurred. Detailed characterization of As-bearing OM at and below the SWI suggests that OM plays an important role in stabilizing redox-sensitive authigenic minerals and associated As. Based on these findings, it is expected that increased concentrations of labile OM will drive post-depositional surface enrichment of As in mining-impacted lakes and may increase or decrease As flux from sediments to overlying surface waters. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Antarctica seems to many people to be a very remote, isolated, and mysterious place at the end of the world, and its name is hardly mentioned in normal life and conversation. However, considering that it plays a key role in the rapidly warming global climate system and its contribution to the continuing sea-level rise, its importance today is increasing day by day and it can be seen that it is of vital importance for humanity. There is increasing interest in the distribution of terrestrial organisms in Antarctica because of the potential use of biodiversity as a predictor or indicator of climate change. Lichenized fungi cover large areas of Antarctica that are not covered by ice and form precursor organisms that thrive in harsh environments. They are the largest contributors to biomass and diversity. The characteristic features of these organisms can be counted as developing certain protective mechanisms, adapting to temperature and radiation, and surviving even when the amount of water in their body is minimized. On the other hand, lichenized fungi are the most dominant components of Antarctic terrestrial vegetation, and their adaptation to extreme conditions; growth forms, reproduction, adaptation to environmental conditions can also be explained through mechanisms. Because of the lichens, dominant organisms of Antarctica, studying lichen biodiversity is very important. Although around 500 species of lichens were reported from Antarctica, the lichen biodiversity of the continent is far from being fully known; as in the last 5 years of our studies on Antarctic lichens, we and other scientists reported a significant number of undescribed or unreported species. So the lichen biodiversity of Antarctica is not fully known as there are still many undescribed or unreported species on the continent. In this paper, we deal with three lichenized fungal species: Arthonia glebosa Tuck., Lecanora atromarginata (H. Magn.) Hertel & Rambold and Lecidea tessellata Flörke which are common in James Ross Island, using nrITS, mtSSU, and RPB1 sequences. The lichen samples are studied by morphological and anatomical characters. In addition, to determine the phylogenetic positions of the species, we provide nrITS and mtSSU of these 3 species from Antarctica and additionally RPB1 sequences of Lecidea tessellata. © 2021, State Institution National Antarctic Scientific Center of the Ministry of Education.

  abstract={A palynological study of 239 outcrop samples and their sedimentological context was undertaken on the Pliocene Productive Series in the Kirmaky and Yasamal valleys, eastern Azerbaijan. The Productive Series is primarily a representation of the palaeo-Volga and forms the main hydrocarbon-producing reservoirs in the South Caspian Basin. Most sands are interpreted as fluvial, based on sedimentary characteristics. Mudstone and siltstones often contain freshwater and brackish assemblages interpreted as ‘Caspian lake’ transgressions, indicative of rapid Caspian Sea level change during the Pliocene. Most samples contain rich assemblages including pollen, spores, dinoflagellate cysts, algae and fungal bodies. Common tree pollen elements include Pinus, Alnus, Betula, Carya, Juglans, Pterocarya, Quercus and Ulmus, which all occur in present-day vegetation or pollen records from the Caucasus or Urals. Herbaceous pollen includes Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae (including Artemisia), Ephedra and Poaceae, commonly found in the drier Caspian regions. The dinoflagellate cysts include ‘Peri-paratethyan endemic’ taxa such as Caspidinium rugosum and Spiniferites cruciformis. ‘Pannonian’ species such as Thalassiphora balcanica, Romanodinium areolatum and Spiniferites oblongus confirm the persistence of these taxa into the early Pliocene in Eastern Paratethys, around five million years later than their first documented presence in Central Paratethys. ‘Caspian lake’ influences diminish up-section, as indicated by a progression from brackish to freshwater and sub-aerial conditions. Productive Series deposition was mainly driven by the combined effects of lake level and catchment climate. The principal hydrocarbon reservoir sands were deposited as a result of increased catchment humidity, whereas drying conditions led to reduced coarse clastic input and deposition of alluvial plain mudstones. Productive Series deposition terminated with the onset of the marine-influenced Akchagyl Series, which spans the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. The lowermost sediments of the Akchagyl Series are freshwater in origin and grade up-section into marine beds containing dinoflagellate cysts of Arctic affinity. © 2021 AASP–The Palynological Society.},

This study aimed at evaluating the possible impacts of climate warming on the taxonomic structure of C. quitensis endophytes and at investigating the contribution of culturable bacterial endophytes to plant growth at low temperatures. The culture-independent analysis revealed changes in the taxonomic structure of bacterial and fungal communities according to plant growth conditions, such as the collection site and the presence of open-top chambers (OTCs), which can simulate global warming. Plants grown inside OTCs showed lower microbial richness and higher relative abundances of biomarker bacterial genera (Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Aeromicrobium, Aureimonas, Hymenobacter, Novosphingobium, Pedobacter, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas) and fungal genera (Alternaria, Cistella, and Vishniacozyma) compared to plants collected from open areas (OA), as a possible response to global warming simulated by OTCs. Culturable psychrotolerant bacteria of C. quitensis were able to endophytically colonize tomato seedlings and promote shoot growth at low temperatures, suggesting their potential contribution to plant tolerance to cold conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Human impact is rapidly changing vegetation globally. The effect of plant cover that no longer exists in a site may still affect the development of future vegetation. We focused on a little studied factor—arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus spore bank—and its effect on three test plant species. In a low Arctic field site, plots were maintained for 6 years, devoid of any vegetation or with a Solidago virgaurea monoculture cover. We analysed the AM fungal morphospecies composition and identified 21 morphospecies in the field plots. The AM morphospecies community was dominated by members of Acaulosporaceae. Monoculturing under low Arctic field conditions changed the soil AM spore community, which became dominated by Glomus hoi. We tested the soil feedback in the greenhouse and grew Solidago virgaurea, Potentilla crantzii and Anthoxanthum odoratum in the field soils from the plots without plant cover, covered with Solidago virgaurea or with intact vegetation. Our results suggest that monoculturing resulted in improved N acquisition by the monocultured plant species Solidago virgaurea which may be related to the AM fungus community. Our results show that a rich community of AM fungus spores may remain viable under field conditions for 6 years in the low Arctic. Spore longevity in field soil in the absence of any host plants differed among AM fungus species. We suggest that AM fungus spore longevity be considered an AM fungal life-history trait. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Biocrusts can be found in a wide array of habitats, where they provide important ecosystem services. These microbial associations are particularly important in High Arctic environments, where biocrust colonize the newly exposed barren soil after glacier retreat and significantly contribute to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Starting from incipient, structurally simple biolayers, they develop in complexity, increasing from the glacier terminus. Starting from a simple community structure, mainly constituted by cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and fungi immersed in a self-secreted extracellular polymeric matrix (cyanobacterial crusts), they later may recruit mosses and lichens (moss crusts and lichen crusts, respectively). The extracellular polymeric matrix protects the biocrust community from abiotic constraints, notably drought and freezing stress, from external physical harming factors, and from predation. The physicochemical characteristics of the extracellular matrix are related to several of its properties, such as its soil-stabilizing effect and water retention. We analysed the chemical (monosaccharidic composition) and macromolecular (molecular weight distribution) properties of the extracellular polymeric matrix of biocrusts with different morphologies collected in northwestern Spitsbergen, Norway. The uronic acid content and molecular weight (MW) distribution of the extracellular polysaccharidic matrices (EPMs) appeared in accordance with the developmental stages of the biocrusts. The MW distribution also showed significant differences between the samples, possibly reflecting differences in microbial enzymatic activities leading to the degradation of high-MW polymers into smaller compounds. The MW distribution profiles presented some important differences, reflecting differences in environmental conditions and, probably, the seasonal variance in microbial community composition that is known to characterize the environment examined in the present study. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Understanding the biogeographic patterns of root-associated fungi and their sensitivity to temperature may improve predictions of future changes in terrestrial biodiversity and associated ecosystem processes, but data are currently limited. Anticipating change will require combining observational data, which predict how climatic factors limit current species distributions, with direct manipulations of climate, which can isolate responses to specific climate variables. Root endophytes are common symbionts of plants, particularly in arctic and alpine environments, yet their responses to climate warming are not resolved. Here, we directly cultured endophytic fungi from roots collected along altitudinal gradients in replicated mountain watersheds and from a 27 y field warming experiment in the Rocky Mountains, USA, to improve understanding of climate impacts on fungal root endophytes. Fungal taxa that were common at high elevations declined most under climate warming, whereas low elevation dominants responded neutrally or increased with experimental warming. Altitudinal gradients in fungal communities were strongly specific to the plant host species. Specifically, Poa species had 25–60% greater fungal isolate abundance and 25–38% greater fungal diversity at high elevations than at low elevation sites. In contrast, Festuca thurberi had 64% lower fungal diversity on roots at high elevation than at low elevation. Our results help to improve understanding of the potential for climate change to alter plant-fungal interactions in mountain ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society},

  abstract={Temperatures approaching or exceeding 20°C have been measured during summer in polar regions at the surfaces of barren fellfield soils under cloudless skies around solar noon. However, despite the upper temperature limit for the growth of cold-adapted microbes—which are abundant in polar soils and have pivotal roles in nutrient cycling—typically being close to this temperature, previous studies have not addressed the consequences of climate change for the metabolism of these organisms in the natural environment. Here in a 5-year field experiment on Alexander Island in the southern maritime Antarctic, we show that the abundance of Pseudogymnoascus roseus, the most widespread decomposer fungus in maritime Antarctic fellfield soils, is reduced by 1–2 orders of magnitude when irrigated and nutrient-amended soils are warmed to >20°C during summer. Laboratory experiments under conditions mimicking those during midsummer in the natural environment indicated that the hyphal extension rates of P. roseus isolates and the activities of five extracellular enzymes are reduced by 54%–96% at high water availability after exposure to temperatures cycling daily from 2 to 21°C and 2 to 24°C, relative to temperatures cycling from 2 to 18°C. Given that the temperatures of surface soils at the study site already reach 19°C during midsummer, the observations reported here suggest that, at predicted rates of warming arising from moderate greenhouse gas emissions, inhibitory effects of climate change on the metabolism of P. roseus could manifest themselves within the next few decades. Furthermore, with peak temperatures at the surfaces of fellfield soils at other maritime Antarctic locations and in High Arctic and alpine regions already exceeding 20°C during summer, the observations suggest that climate warming has the potential to inhibit the growth of other cold-adapted microbes, with negative effects on soils as the Earth's climate continues to warm. © 2020 The Authors.

We wanted to determine the relationship between soil fungal communities and geochemical factors (geographical location and soil physicochemical properties) in three widely separated geographical regions (the Antarctic, Arctic, and Tibet Plateau). Using high-throughput Illumina amplicon sequencing, we characterized the fungal communities in 53 soil samples collected from the three regions. The fungal richness and diversity indices were not significantly different among the three regions. However, fungal community composition and many fungal taxa (Thelebolales, Verrucariales, Sordariales, Chaetothyriales, Hypocreales, Pleosporales, Capnodiales, and Dothideales) significantly differed among three regions. Furthermore, geographical location (latitude and altitude) and six soil physicochemical properties (SiO42−-Si, pH, NO3−-N, organic nitrogen, NO2−-N, and organic carbon) were significant geochemical factors those were correlated with the soil fungal community composition.

However, the hypersaline environment may also potentially preserve life and its biomolecules over geological timescales. The high concentration of natural perchlorates is scarcely reported on Earth. The presence of perchlorates in soil and ice has been recorded in some extreme environments including the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica, one of the best terrestrial analogues for Mars. In the frame of “Life in space” Italian astrobiology project, the polyextremophilic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus, a eukaryotic test organism isolated from the Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities, has been tested for its resistance, when grown on different hypersaline substrata. In addition, C. antarcticus was grown on Martian relevant perchlorate medium (0.4 wt% of Mg(ClO4)2 and 0.6 wt% of Ca(ClO4)2) to investigate the possibility for the fungus to survive in Martian environment. Here, the results indicate a good survivability and metabolic activity recovery of the black fungus when grown on four Martian relevant perchlorates.

In this study, we characterized fungi isolated from the fresh leaves of this grass species. The fungi were isolated from four individual plants from Half Moon Island (246 leaf fragments investigated), and seven from King George Island-Keller Peninsula (with 111 leaf fragments investigated) Antarctica. Neoascochyta paspali, Septoriella elongata, Pyrenophora cf. chaetomioides and Alternaria sp. were associated with the plant and identified through analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the rDNA and nuclear ribosomal large subunit rRNA gene (LSU) as well as through macro and micro-morphological characteristics. The isolates showed higher growth rate ranging from 10 to 20 °C. An interesting result was that the aforementioned fungi are already recognized as both plant pathogens and endophytic fungi.

  abstract={Rising temperatures in the Arctic and the expansion of plants to higher latitudes will significantly alter belowground microbial communities and their activity. Given that microbial communities are major producers of greenhouse gases, understanding the magnitude of microbial responses to warming and increased carbon input to Arctic soils is necessary to improve global climate change models. In this study, active layer and permafrost soils from northern Greenland (81° N) were subjected to increased carbon input, in the form of plant litter, and temperature increase, using a combined field and laboratory approach. In the field experiment, unamended or litter-amended soils were transplanted from the permafrost layer to the top soil layer and incubated for one year, whereas in the laboratory experiment active layer and permafrost soils with or without litter amendment were incubated at 4 °C or 15 °C for six weeks. Soil microbial communities were evaluated using bacterial 16S and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing and respiration was used as a measure of microbial activity. Litter amendment resulted in similar changes in microbial abundances, diversities and structure of microbial communities, in the field and lab experiments. These changes in microbial communities were likely due to a strong increase in fast-growing bacterial copiotrophic taxa and basidiomycete yeasts. Furthermore, respiration was significantly higher with litter input for both active layer and permafrost soil and with both approaches. Temperature alone had only a small effect on microbial communities, with the exception of the field-incubated permafrost soils, where we observed a shift towards oligotrophic taxa, specifically for bacteria. These results demonstrate that alterations in High Arctic mineral soils may result in predictable shifts in the soil microbiome. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Culture-independent molecular techniques brought new perspectives for research regarding soil microorganisms, which is relevant to microbiologists and industry. Therefore, new research is necessary to broaden our knowledge about ecology and physiology of mycobacteria in extreme environments. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of mycobacteria in Antarctica soil samples and to standardize molecular and culture-dependent techniques to their isolation. Soil DNA was extracted and submitted to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), rrs mycobacterial gene amplification and partial sequencing. Thereby, 10 colonies morphologically similar to mycobacteria were isolated from 10 different samples, resulting in 15 DNA sequences where Mycobacterium neglectum and Mycobacterium kumamotonense were identified, suggesting that Mycobacterium terrae complex representatives are ubiquitous in the region. This study proposes a simple method for mycobacteria cultivation from soil samples and shows that ornithogenic soils can be the source of organic matter and low pH, modulating the mycobacterial Antarctica diversity. Further research aiming to explore mycobacterial diversity in soil are needed to increase knowledge and better explore their evolution, their relation with animal and human species and their potential biotechnological use. © 2022 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR},

  abstract={Permafrost thaw induces soil hydrological changes which in turn affects carbon cycle processes in the Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. However, hydrological impacts of thawing permafrost on microbial processes and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics are poorly understood. This study examined changes in microbial communities using gene and genome-centric metagenomics on an Arctic floodplain subject to decadal drainage, and linked them to CO2 and CH4 flux and soil chemistry. Decadal drainage led to significant changes in the abundance, taxonomy, and functional potential of microbial communities, and these modifications well explained the changes in CO2 and CH4 fluxes between ecosystem and atmosphere—increased fungal abundances potentially increased net CO2 emission rates and highly reduced CH4 emissions in drained sites corroborated the marked decrease in the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs. Interestingly, various microbial taxa disproportionately responded to drainage: Methanoregula, one of the key players in methanogenesis under saturated conditions, almost disappeared, and also Methylococcales methanotrophs were markedly reduced in response to drainage. Seven novel methanogen population genomes were recovered, and the metabolic reconstruction of highly correlated population genomes revealed novel syntrophic relationships between methanogenic archaea and syntrophic partners. These results provide a mechanistic view of microbial processes regulating GHG dynamics in the terrestrial carbon cycle, and disproportionate microbial responses to long-term drainage provide key information for understanding the effects of warming-induced soil drying on microbial processes in Arctic wetland ecosystems. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Among the Embryophyta we found 16 plant operational taxonomic units from three Divisions, including one Marchantiophyta, eight Bryophyta and seven Magnoliophyta. Sequences of six taxa were detected at both sampling sites, eight only at Whalers Bay and two only at Crater Lake. All of the Magnoliophyta sequences (flowering plants) represent species that are exotic to Antarctica, with most being plausibly linked to human food sources originating from local national research operator and tourism facilities.

A preliminary sequence analysis of the β-tubulin (tub2) gene marker allowed us to identify several interesting species of Penicillium, which were later characterized phylogenetically with the barcodes recommended for species delimitation in the genus. Based on the multi-locus phylogeny of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA, and partial fragments of tub2, calmodulin (cmdA), and the RNA polymerase II largest subunit (rpb2) genes, in combination with phenotypic analyses, five novel species are described. These are P. ausonanum in section Lanata-Divaricata, P. guarroi in sect. Gracilenta, P. irregulare in sect. Canescentia, P. sicoris in sect. Paradoxa and P. submersum in sect. Robsamsonia. The study of several isolates from samples collected in different locations resulted in the reinstatement of P. vaccaeorum into section Citrina. Finally, P. heteromorphum (sect.

  abstract={We assessed fungal diversity in deep-sea sediments obtained from different depths in the Southern Ocean using the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA by metabarcoding through high-throughput sequencing (HTS). We detected 655,991 DNA reads representing 263 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), dominated by Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Mucoromycota, Chytridiomycota and Rozellomycota, confirming that deep-sea sediments can represent a hotspot of fungal diversity in Antarctica. The community diversity detected included 17 dominant fungal ASVs, 62 intermediate and 213 rare. The dominant fungi included taxa of Mortierella, Penicillium, Cladosporium, Pseudogymnoascus, Phaeosphaeria and Torula. Despite the extreme conditions of the Southern Ocean benthos, the total fungal community detected in these marine sediments displayed high indices of diversity and richness, and moderate dominance, which varied between the different depths sampled. The highest diversity indices were obtained in sediments from 550 m and 250 m depths. Only 49 ASVs (18.63%) were detected at all the depths sampled, while 16 ASVs were detected only in the deepest sediment sampled at 1463 m. Based on sequence identities, the fungal community included some globally distributed taxa, primarily recorded otherwise from terrestrial environments, suggesting transport from these to deep marine sediments. The assigned taxa included symbionts, decomposers and plant-, animal- and human-pathogenic fungi, suggesting that deep-sea sediments host a complex fungal diversity, although metabarcoding does not itself confirm that living or viable organisms are present. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces are a source of cold-adapted microorganisms, but little is known about their fungal inhabitants. Here, we provide the first report of distinctive fungal communities in cryoconite holes in the Werenskiold Glacier on Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, Arctic). Due to a combination of two incubation temperatures (7 °C and 24 ± 0.5 °C) and two media during isolation (PDA, YPG), as well as classical and molecular identification approaches, we were able to identify 23 different fungi (21 species and 2 unassigned species). Most of the fungi cultured from cryoconite sediment were ascomycetous filamentous micromycetes. However, four representatives of macromycetes were also identified (Bjerkandera adusta, Holwaya mucida, Orbiliaceae sp., and Trametes versicolor). Some of the described fungi possess biotechnological potential (Aspergillus pseudoglaucus, A. sydowii, Penicillium expansum, P. velutinum, B. adusta, and T. versicolor), thus, we propose the Arctic region as a source of new strains for industrial applications. In addition, two phytopathogenic representatives were present (P. sumatraense, Botrytis cinerea), as well as one potentially harmful to humans (Cladosporium cladosporioides). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the occurrence of A. pseudoglaucus, C. allicinum, C. ramotenellum, P. sumatraense, P. velutinum, P. cumulodentata, B. adusta, and T. versicolor in polar regions. In all likelihood, two unassigned fungus species (Orbiliaceae and Dothideomycetes spp.) might also be newly described in such environments. Additionally, due to experimenting with 10 sampling sites located at different latitudes, we were able to conclude that the number of fungal spores decreases as one moves down the glacier. Considering the prevalence and endangerment of glacial environments worldwide, such findings suggest their potential as reservoirs of fungal diversity, which should not be overlooked. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Abstract: The study of microbial complexes in organo-accumulative horizons of Antarctic soils (Cryosols, Leptosols) at the Larsemann Hills and Schirmacher oases and on King George Island has been carried out by the fouling glass method. This method allows one to study the taxonomic composition of microorganisms, features of their morphology, inter-organism interactions, and spatial organization of the complex of microorganisms, as well as to simulate the processes of colonization of mineral surfaces. The investigated microbial complexes can be subdivided into four groups with respect to dominant microorganisms: (1) diverse microbial complexes of King George Island with a considerable portion of diatoms among algae and with a predominance of mycelium in the fungal biomass; (2) complexes of lichen–moss, moss, and algal–moss associations in lake basins with a greater proportion of eukaryotic and coccoid cyanobacteria and with mycelium and sporous forms of micromycetes; (3) complexes of moss and algal–moss associations in the bottoms of wet valleys with a higher proportion of filamentous cyanobacteria and with the absence of fungi, or their presence in the form of short chains of chlamydospores; and (4) hypolithic microbial complexes of rock baths in dry rocky habitats, where the fouling of glasses did not take place. The microbial complexes in different glass samples taken in February–March in different years proved to be at different stages of development. Microscopic mycelium of fungi was not abundant in all algae and moss associations; in some, it was practically absent. Among algae, not cyanobacteria, but eukaryotic algae dominated in a number of habitats: diatoms, green algae, and streptophytes. The totality of the complex features indicated the extremity of the habitat: one morphotype of melanized fungal mycelium dominated in a particular sample; there was no diversity of spore forms, which indirectly indicates a low taxonomic diversity of fungi; multiple chlamydospore formation and microcycles of development were common. Among cyanobacteria, brown and reddish coloration was often found, and the formation of biofilms on glasses was limited to microcolonies, while algal biofilms abundantly covered the soil of the studied horizons. Apparently, extended biofilms were formed over time exceeding the exposure time of the glasses. Hypolithic communities did not colonize new habitats (glasses) for several years of exposure, unlike the bottoms of hydromorphic valleys and lake basins in oases (glasses overgrown in a year) and King George Island (glasses overgrown in 10 days). © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

Although considerable research has assessed microorganisms indigenous to coastal regions of Antarctica, particularly their lakes, ponds, and soils, to our knowledge only one characterized bacterium, a strain of Pseudomonas, has been isolated from South Pole ice or snow. Metagenomic community analyses described in this work and elsewhere reveal that a diversity of bacteria exists in inland polar snows, yet attempts to culture and characterize these microbes from this extreme environment have been few to date. In this molecular and culture-dependent investigation of the microbiology of inland Antarctica, we enriched and isolated two new strains of bacteria and one strain of yeast (Fungi) from South Pole snow samples. The bacteria were of the genera Methylobacterium and Sphingomonas, and the yeast grouped with species of Naganishia (class Tremellocytes). In addition to phylogenetic analyses, characterization of these isolates included determinations of cell morphology, growth as a function of temperature, salinity tolerance, and carbon and energy source versatility. All organisms were found to be cold-adapted, and the yeast strain additionally showed considerable halotolerance. These descriptions expand our understanding of the diversity and metabolic activities of snowbound microorganisms of interior Antarctica. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Seven full-scale biological wastewater treatment systems located in the Polar Arctic Circle region in Finland were investigated to determine their Archaea, Bacteria and Fungi community structure, and their relationship with the operational conditions of the bioreactors by the means of quantitative PCR, massive parallel sequencing and multivariate redundancy analysis. The results showed dominance of Archaea and Bacteria members in the bioreactors. The activated sludge systems showed strong selection of Bacteria but not for Archaea and Fungi, as suggested by diversity analyses. Core OTUs in influent and bioreactors were classified as Methanobrevibacter, Methanosarcina, Terrestrial Group Thaumarchaeota and unclassified Euryarchaeota member for Archaea; Trichococcus, Leptotrichiaceae and Comamonadaceae family, and Methylorosula for Bacteria and Trichosporonaceae family for Fungi. All influents shared core OTUs in all domains, but in bioreactors this did not occur for Bacteria. Oligotype structure of core OTUs showed several ubiquitous Fungi oligotypes as dominant in sewage and bioreactors. Multivariate redundancy analyses showed that the majority of core OTUs were related to organic matter and nutrients removal. Also, there was evidence of competition among Archaea and Fungi core OTUs, while all Bacteria OTUs were positively correlated among them. The results obtained highlighted interesting features of extremely cold temperature bioreactors. © 2018 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Describing dynamics of belowground organisms, such as fungi, can be challenging. Results of studies based on environmental DNA (eDNA) may be biased as the template does not discriminate between metabolically active cells and dead biomass. We analyzed ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) coextracted from 48 soil samples collected from a manipulated snow depth experiment in two distinct vegetation types in Svalbard, in the High Arctic. Our main goal was to compare if the rDNA and rRNA metabarcoding templates produced congruent results that would lead to consistent ecological interpretation. Data derived from both rDNA and rRNA clustered according to vegetation types. Different sets of environmental variables explained the community composition based on the metabarcoding template. rDNA and rRNA-derived community composition of symbiotrophs and saprotrophs, unlike pathotrophs, clustered together in a similar way as when the community composition was analyzed using all OTUs in the study. Mean OTU richness was higher for rRNA, especially in symbiotrophs. The metabarcoding template was more important than vegetation type in explaining differences in richness. The proportion of symbiotrophic, saprotrophic and functionally unassigned reads differed between rDNA and rRNA, but showed similar trends. There was no evidence for increased snow depth influence on fungal community composition or richness. Our findings suggest that template choice may be especially important for estimating biodiversity, such as richness and relative abundances, especially in Helotiales and Agaricales, but not for inferring community composition. Differences in study results originating from rDNA or rRNA may directly impact the ecological conclusions of one's study, which could potentially lead to false conclusions on the dynamics of microbial communities in a rapidly changing Arctic. © 2019 Wutkowska, Vader, Mundra, Cooper and Eidesen.},

  abstract={The unique and fragile High Arctic ecosystems are vulnerable to global climate warming. The elucidation of factors driving microbial distribution and activity in arctic soils is essential for a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem functioning and its response to environmental change. The goals of this study were to investigate microbial biomass and activity, microbial community structure (MCS), and their environmental controls in soils along three elevational transects in the coastal mountains of Billefjorden, central Svalbard. Soils from four different altitudes (25, 275, 525 and 765gm above sea level) were analyzed for a suite of characteristics including temperature regimes, organic matter content, base cation availability, moisture, pH, potential respiration, and microbial biomass and community structure using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). We observed significant spatial heterogeneity of edaphic properties among transects, resulting in transect-specific effects of altitude on most soil parameters. We did not observe any clear elevation pattern in microbial biomass, and microbial activity revealed contrasting elevational patterns between transects. We found relatively large horizontal variability in MCS (i.e., between sites of corresponding elevation in different transects), mainly due to differences in the composition of bacterial PLFAs, but also a systematic altitudinal shift in MCS related to different habitat preferences of fungi and bacteria, which resulted in high fungi-to-bacteria ratios at the most elevated sites. The biological soil crusts on these most elevated, unvegetated sites can host microbial assemblages of a size and activity comparable to those of the arctic tundra ecosystem. The key environmental factors determining horizontal and vertical changes in soil microbial properties were soil pH, organic carbon content, soil moisture and Mg2+ availability. © Author(s) 2018.},

Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were the most abundant species obtained. Fifty taxa grew at 40 °C; displayed haemolytic and phospholipase activities; produced tiny spores, capsule, and melanin; showed growth at different pH; and showed resistance to amphotericin B. Interestingly, the minimum inhibitory concentration of amphotericin B increased by 5–10 fold for some A. fumigatus isolates after phagocytosis by amoeba.

Glacier soils harbor an active microbial community of decomposers, and under the continuous retraction of glaciers, the soil starts to present a gradient of physical, chemical, and biological factors reflecting regional changes over time. Little is known about the biological nature of fungi in Antarctic glacier soils. In this sense, this work aimed at studying the behavior of fungal community structure from samples of glacier soil collected after glacial retreat (Collins Glacier). A total of 309 fungi distributed in 19 genera were obtained from eleven soil samples. Representatives of the genera Pseudogymnoascus (Ascomycota) and Mortierella (Mortierellomycota) were the most abundant isolates in all samples. The data revealed the presence of filamentous fungi belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota, rarely found in Antarctica. Analysis of the generalized linear models revealed that the distance from the glacier as well as phosphorus and clay were able to modify the distribution of fungal species. Environmental variations proved to have influenced the genera Pseudogymnoascus and Pseudeutorium. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Here, by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA genes in 40 soils sampled from along a 1,650 km climatic gradient through the maritime Antarctic, we determine whether rising air temperatures might similarly influence the diversity of soil bacteria. Of 22 environmental factors, mean annual surface air temperature was the strongest and most consistent predictor of soil bacterial diversity. Significant, but weaker, associations between bacterial diversity and soil moisture content, C:N ratio, and Ca, Mg, PO                             4                             3−                              and dissolved organic C concentrations were also detected. These findings indicate that further rises in air temperature in the maritime Antarctic may enhance terrestrial ecosystem productivity through positive effects on soil bacterial diversity.                          © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract={The major part of the north polar region is intensely rising by postglacial crustal movement. This process gives rise to the separation of different basins from seas and oceans, which affects a combination of freshwater and marine organisms. Gradually losing contact with the seas, many near-shore lakes of the Arctic are mostly desalted and form bogs. Fungi as decomposers play an important role in all ecosystems. However, the diversity and role of fungi in Arctic aquatic ecosystems is largely unknown. It is also not clear how the taxonomic structure of the fungal community is affected by the process of gradual desalinization and waterlogging. We investigated the diversity of filamentous culturable fungi in different parts of the brackish Kislo-Sladkoe Lake (White Sea, Russia). Annually, 42 samples of the bottom and coastal soils have been collected at the lake from which fungi were recovered on standard and selective media. Based on morphological and molecular markers, a total of 127 taxa have been identified. The fungal community appeared to be influenced by its sea origin and comprised both marine (Paradendryphiella salina, Acremonium spp.) and terrestrial soil species of Penicillium, Talaromyces, Mucor, Umbelopsis, Cladosporium, Cadophora, Sistotrema, Helotiales, Pleosporales, sphagnum moss destructors (Oidiodendron spp.) and insect-associated species of Tolypocladium. The results indicate that the composition of the fungal community in the rising polar White Sea region reflects the dynamics of global changes in physical–chemical parameters and animal and plant associations because of separation from the sea. © 2018, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Climate change may alter nutrient cycling in Arctic soils and plants. Deeper snow during winter, as well as summer warming, could increase soil temperatures and thereby the availability of otherwise limiting nutrients such as nitrogen (N). We used fences to manipulate snow depths in Svalbard for 9 consecutive years, resulting in three snow regimes: 1) Ambient with a maximum snow depth of 35 cm, 2) Medium with a maximum of 100 cm and 3) Deep with a maximum of 150 cm. We increased temperatures during one growing season using Open Top Chambers (OTCs), and sampled soil and vascular plant leaves throughout summer 2015. Labile soil N, especially inorganic N, during the growing season was significantly greater in Deep than Ambient suggesting N supply in excess of plant and microbial demand. However, we found no effect of Medium snow depth or short-term summer temperature increase on soil N, presumably due to minor impacts on soil temperature and moisture. The temporal patterns of labile soil N were similar in all snow regimes with high concentrations of organic N immediately after snowmelt, thereafter dropping towards peak growing season. Concentrations of all N forms increased at the end of summer. Vascular plants had high N at the start of growing season, decreasing as summer progressed, and leaf N concentrations were highest in Deep, corresponding to the higher soil N availability. Short-term summer warming was associated with lower leaf N concentrations, presumably due to growth dilution. Deeper snow enhanced labile soil organic and inorganic N pools and plant N uptake. Leaf 15N natural abundance levels (δ15N) in Deep indicated a higher degree of utilization of inorganic than organic N, which was especially pronounced in mycorrhizal plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Snow in Antarctica is a vast terrestrial ecosystem and plays a key role that has likely been underestimated. Algae are the key primary producers on the coloured snow surface, and they support a microbial community that includes bacteria, fungi and/or invertebrates. We analysed microbial communities that co-exist in green and red snow samples from the Fildes Peninsula by Illumina sequencing, Antarctica, as well as the influence of snow physicochemical properties. We detected several species of green algae from Chlorophyta and Ochrophyta as well as fungi and cercozoans. The three red snow samples (RS1, RS2 and RS3) were represented by mixed eukaryotic microalgae from Sanguina, Chloromonas and Trebouxiophyceae. The green snow sample GS5 exhibited lake-to-snow colonisation composed of Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae and Chrysophyta representatives. The red snow RS4, predominantly by Chlainomonas sp. from slush layers, which presented a different microbial community from the other red snow samples, was sampled close to green snow sample GS5 near Lake Changhu. The environmental parameters were involved into descriptive differences among these coloured snow samples. The two snow algae Chlainomonas and Sanguina were firstly reported from Antarctica, which indicates distinguished snow algae colonisation that is closely connected with the melting snow at the lake ice-cover. Meanwhile, consistent with previous bacterial community profiles, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were mostly represented in all the coloured snow samples. Polaromonas (Betaproteobacteria) was the most abundant genus, and its presence was reportedly essential for the sustained growth of snow algae. Flavobacterium from Bacteroidetes was the most frequently detected genera in GS5, but the Sphingobacteriia with only a few reads were an interestingly minority in GS5. The snow-algae-associated bacteria were closely related to psychrophilic strains or sequences from low-temperature environments. Many possible factors influence on the coloured snow microbial communities would require attentions, to help understand their occurrence mechanisms, their biogeographic distributions in polar regions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Fungi play a crucial role in terrestrial Arctic ecosystems as symbionts of vascular plants and nutrient recyclers in soil, with many species persistently or temporarily inhabiting the phyllosphere of the vegetation. In this study we apply high-throughput sequencing to investigate the mycobiome of 172 samples of fresh (current year) and aged (3 year old) needles of Picea glauca from three sites over a distance of 500 km in Alaska (USA). We analysed Illumina-generated ITS2 sequences to relate mycobiome data with phenotypic tree traits, measures of genetic variation and climate variables obtained from long-term monitoring of the sites. Alpha-diversity declined with increasing environmental stress/climate harshness. Fungal communities differed in richness and taxonomic composition between sites, with a pronounced difference in the relative abundance of OTUs assigned to species of the rust genus Chrysomyxa, plant pathogens which seem to have been in an outbreak at two sites at the time of sampling. Beside climate parameters, needle age was the second strongest explanatory variable of the mycobiome composition, whereas we found no effect of tree genetic variation, indicating that environmental and tree trait specific variables mainly determined individual white spruce mycobiomes at Alaska's treelines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society},

Aims: The goal of the present study was to assess growth performance and plant–microbe interactions between seedlings and native and foreign microbial communities in ecotypes of the cushion plant Silene acaulis from Europe and North America. Methods: Using seed sourced from Colorado, USA, and Ireland we grew Silene seedlings in sterile bulk soil with live inocula added from their own local soil and each other’s soil. We measured above-ground plant growth metrics, and analysed fungal and bacterial community composition using marker gene sequencing and microscopy. Results: Seedlings growing in foreign soil inocula showed significantly greater biomass or shoot length compared to growth in home soil inocula. While seedling root microbiomes were overall convergent with each other compared to source soil inocula, significantly lower filtering of fungal taxa from the soil was observed for seedlings growing in foreign compared to home soil inocula. Conclusions: Foreign plant ecotypes from distant habitats may experience competitively beneficial effects when growing in local soil communities; however, the nature and generality of these interactions requires further analysis. © 2021 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract={L-Asparaginase (L-asparagine aminohydrolase, E.C. 3.5.1.1) has been proven to be competent in treating Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL), which is widely observed in paediatric and adult groups. Currently, clinical L-Asparaginase formulations are derived from bacterial sources such as Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. These formulations when administered to ALL patients lead to several immunological and hypersensitive reactions. Hence, additional purification steps are required to remove toxicity induced by the amalgamation of other enzymes like glutaminase and urease. Production of L-Asparaginase that is free of glutaminase and urease is a major area of research. In this paper, we report the screening and isolation of fungal species collected from the soil and mosses in the Schirmacher Hills, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, that produce L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. A total of 55 isolates were obtained from 33 environmental samples that were tested by conventional plate techniques using Phenol red and Bromothymol blue as indicators. Among the isolated fungi, 30 isolates showed L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. The L-Asparaginase producing strain Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1, which showed the highest zone index, was then optimized with a Taguchi design. Optimum enzyme activity of 20.57 U mL−1 was obtained at a temperature of 30 °C and pH of 7.0 after 60 hours. Our work suggests that isolation of fungi from extreme environments such as Antarctica may lead to an important advancement in therapeutic applications with fewer side effects. © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Soil microbes play important roles in global carbon and nutrient cycling. Soil microfungi are generally amongst the most important contributors. They produce various extracellular hydrolase enzymes that break down the complex organic molecules in the soil into simpler form. In this study, we investigated patterns of amylase and cellulase (which are responsible for breaking down starch and cellulose, respectively) relative activity (RA) on solid media at different culture temperatures in fungal strains from Arctic, Antarctic and tropical soils. Fungal isolates from all three regions were inoculated onto R2A media supplemented with starch for amylase and carboxymethylcellulose and trypan blue for cellulase screening. The isolates were then incubated at 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C and examined for activity after 5 and 10 days, for tropical and polar isolates, respectively. The data obtained indicate that the polar fungal strains exhibited similar patterns of amylase and cellulase RA. Both Arctic and Antarctic fungi showed highest RA for amylase and cellulase at 35 °C, while colony growth was maximised at 15 °C. Colony growth and RA of the polar isolates were negatively correlated suggesting that, as temperatures increase, the cells become stressed and have fewer resources available to invest in growth. Unlike polar isolates, tropical isolates did not exhibit any trend of colony growth with temperature, rather having idiosyncratic patterns in each isolate. The low enzyme production and RA levels in the tropical strains may suggest both a low ability to respond to temperature variation in their natural thermally stable tropical habitats, as well as a level of thermal stress limiting their enzyme production ability. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Functional symbiosis is considered one of the successful mechanisms by which plants that inhabit extreme environment improve their ability to tolerate different types of stress. One of the most conspicuous type of symbiosis is the endophyticism. This interaction has been noted to play a role in the adaptation of the native vascular plant Colobanthus quitensis to the stressful environments of Antarctica, characterized by low temperatures and extreme aridity. Projections of climate change for this ecosystem indicate that abiotic conditions will be less limiting due to an increase in temperature and water availability in the soil. Due to this decrease in stress induced by the climate change, it has been suggested that the positive role of fungal endophytes on performance of C. quitensis plants would decrease. In this study, we evaluated the role of endophytic fungi on osmoprotective molecules (sugar production, proline, oxidative stress) and gene expression (CqNCED1, CqABCG25, and CqRD22) as well as physiological traits (stomatal opening, net photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance) in individuals of C. quitensis. Individual plants of C. quitensis with (E+) and without (E−) endophytic fungi were exposed to simulated conditions of increased water availability (W+), having the current limiting water condition (W−) in Antarctica as control. The results reveal an endophyte-mediated lower oxidative stress, higher production of sugars and proline in plants. In addition, E+ plants showed differential expressions in genes related with drought stress response, which was more evident in W− than in W+. These parameters corresponded with increased physiological mechanisms such as higher net photosynthesis, stomatal opening and conductance under presence of endophytes (E+) as well as the projected water condition (W+) for Antarctica. These results suggest that the presence of fungal endophytes plays a positive role in favoring tolerance to drought in C. quitensis. However, this positive role would be diminished if the stress factor is relaxed, suggesting that the role of endophytes could be less important under a future scenario of climate change in Antarctica with higher soil water availability. © Copyright © 2020 Hereme, Morales-Navarro, Ballesteros, Barrera, Ramos, Gundel and Molina-Montenegro.},

When the soil temperature was measured at a depth of 2–5 cm during the 2013–2015 summer seasons, the mean temperature inside OTC (OTC-In) increased by approximately 0.8 °C compared with outside OTC (OTC-Out), while soil chemical and physical characteristics did not change. Soils (2015 summer) from OTC-In and OTC-Out were subjected to analysis for change in microbial community and degradation rate of humic substances (HS, the largest pool of recalcitrant organic carbon in soil). Archaeal and bacterial communities in OTC-In were minimally affected by warming compared with those in OTC-Out, with archaeal methanogenic Thermoplasmata slightly increased in abundance. The abundance of heterotrophic fungi Ascomycota was significantly altered in OTC-In. Total bacterial and fungal biomass in OTC-In increased by 20% compared to OTC-Out, indicating that this may be due to increased microbial degradation activity for soil organic matter (SOM) including HS, which would result in the release of more low-molecular-weight growth substrates from SOM. Despite the effects of warming on the microbial community over the 8-years-experiments warming did not induce any detectable change in content or structure of polymeric HS. These results suggest that increased temperature may have significant and direct effects on soil microbial communities inhabiting maritime Antarctic and that soil microbes would subsequently provide more available carbon sources for other indigenous microbes. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  abstract={We surveyed the diversity of cultivable fungi isolated from cold and hot volcanic soils of Deception Island, Antarctica. Seventy-four fungal isolates were identified; these belonged to 17 taxa in the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, Purpureocillium, and Mortierella. The fungal assemblages showed low diversity, richness, and dominance indices. The Aspergillus taxa were dominant in the soils at 0 °C, 50 °C, and 100 °C. Aspergillus lacticoffeatus, Aspergillus cf. ruber, Penicillium citrinun, and Purpureocillium sodanum were present only in soils having a temperature of 100 °C. Aspergillus calidoustus was present in all thermal soils and displayed the highest densities. The majority of fungi displayed mesophilic behavior; however, different isolates of Aspergillus lacticoffeatus and Aspergillus niger were able to grow at 50 °C; these are phylogenetically close to the causative agents of aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals. Deception Island perhaps represents one of the most visited regions in Antarctica and the tourism there has increased over the last 20 years, especially by elderly tourists, probably with weak immune systems, come in contact with the resident microorganisms, including the thermo-resistant opportunistic Aspergillus species. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Our understanding of the diversity and community dynamics of soil fungi has increased greatly through the use of DNA-based identification. Community characterization of metabolically active communities via RNA sequencing has previously revealed differences between ‘active’ and ‘total’ fungal communities, which may be influenced by the persistence of DNA from nonactive components. However, it is not known how fungal traits influence their prevalence in these contrasting community profiles. In this study, we coextracted DNA and RNA from soil collected from three Antarctic islands to test for differences between total and active soil fungal communities. By matching these geographically isolated fungi against a global dataset of soil fungi, we show that widely dispersed taxa are often more abundant in the total community, whilst taxa restricted to Antarctica are more likely to have higher abundance in the active community. In addition, we find that active communities have lower richness, and show a reduction in the abundance of the most dominant fungi, whilst there are consistent differences in the abundances of certain taxonomic groups between the total and active communities. These results suggest that the views of soil fungal communities offered by DNA- and RNA-based characterization differ in predictable ways. © 2019 The Authors.

  abstract={During a research cruise in 2016, we isolated fungi from sediments, seawater, driftwood, fruiting bodies, and macroalgae using three different media to assess species richness and potential bioactivity of cultivable marine fungi in the High Arctic region. Ten stations from the Svalbard archipelago (73–80 °N, 18–31 °E) were investigated and 33 fungal isolates were obtained. These grouped into 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) with acut-off set at 98% similarity. The taxonomic analysis showed that 17 OTUs belonged to Ascomycota, one to Basidiomycota, two to Mucoromycota and two were fungal-like organisms. The nuc rDNA V1-V5 regions of 18S (18S) and D1-D3 regions of 28S (28S) were sequenced from representative isolates of each OTU for comparison to GenBank sequences. Isolates of Lulworthiales and Eurotiales were the most abundant, with seven isolates each. Among the 22 OTUs, nine represent potentially undescribed species based on low similarity to GenBank sequences and 10 isolates showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria in an agar diffusion plug assay. These results show promise for the Arctic region as asource of novel marine fungi with the ability to produce bioactive secondary metabolites with antibacterial properties. © 2019 The Author(s).

  abstract={Microbes growing at low temperatures encounter numerous growth constraints. However, fungi that inhabit polar regions can grow and decompose organic compounds at low temperatures. Research on the biodiversity and secretion ability of yeasts from East Ongul Island, and evaluation of their extracellular enzymatic activity at temperatures ranging from −3 to 20 °C, was performed and described in this study. In total, 95 yeast strains were isolated from the surface soil on East Ongul Island, East Antarctica. Based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain sequence similarity, these strains were classified into 10 genera and 16 species. All strains were categorized as basidiomycetous yeasts. One representative strain was selected from each species, and its ability to grow at temperatures between −3 and 37 °C was evaluated. Strain abilities to secrete extracellular enzymes (lipase, cellulase, and protease) at temperatures ranging from −3 to 20 °C were also investigated. Based on the optimal and maximal growth temperatures, the yeasts were classified as psychrophilic or psychrotolerant. All the strains investigated in this study were able to grow at −3 °C and in vitamin-free media. Psychrophilic yeasts, such as Glaciozyma antarctica, Gl. martinii, Mrakia gelida, and Phenoliferia glacialis, did not secrete pronounced amounts of extracellular enzymes at −3 °C; in contrast, the psychrotolerant yeasts Goffeauzyma gilvescens, Holtermanniella wattica, Tausonia pullulans, and Udeniomyces puniceus secreted copious amounts of enzymes, even at subzero temperatures. These results indicated that psychrotolerant yeasts, rather than psychrophilic yeasts, play important roles in the nutrient cycle in the East Ongul Island ecosystem at near-subzero temperatures. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

  abstract={Multiple drivers shape the spatial distribution of species, including dispersal capacity, niche incumbency, climate variability, orographic barriers, and plate tectonics. However, biogeographic patterns of fungi commonly do not fit conventional expectations based on studies of animals and plants. Fungi, in general, are known to occur across exceedingly broad, intercontinental distributions, including some important components of biological soil crust communities (BSCs). However, molecular data often reveal unexpected biogeographic patterns in lichenized fungal species that are assumed to have cosmopolitan distributions. The lichen-forming fungal species Psora decipiens is found on all continents, except Antarctica and occurs in BSCs across diverse habitats, ranging from hot, arid deserts to alpine habitats. In order to better understand factors that shape population structure in cosmopolitan lichen-forming fungal species, we investigated biogeographic patterns in the cosmopolitan taxon P. decipiens, along with the closely related taxa P. crenata and P. saviczii. We generated a multi-locus sequence dataset based on a worldwide sampling of these taxa in order to reconstruct evolutionary relationships and explore phylogeographic patterns. Both P. crenata and P. decipiens were not recovered as monophyletic; and P. saviczii specimens were recovered as a monophyletic clade closely related to a number of lineages comprised of specimens representing P. decipiens. Striking phylogeographic patterns were observed for P. crenata, with populations from distinct geographic regions belonging to well-separated, monophyletic lineages. South African populations of P. crenata were further divided into well-supported sub-clades. While well-supported phylogenetic substructure was also observed for the nominal taxon P. decipiens, nearly all lineages were comprised of specimens collected from intercontinental populations. However, all Australian specimens representing P. decipiens were recovered within a single well-supported monophyletic clade consisting solely of Australian samples. Our study supports up to 10 candidate species-level lineages in P. decipiens, based on genealogical concordance and coalescent-based species delimitation analyses. Our results support the general pattern of the biogeographic isolation of lichen-forming fungal populations in Australia, even in cases where closely related congeners have documented intercontinental distributions. Our study has important implications for understanding factors influencing diversification and distributions of lichens associated with BSC. © 2018 Leavitt, Westberg, Nelsen, Elix, Timdal, Sohrabi, St. Clair, Williams, Wedin and Lumbsch.},

  abstract={Araucaria araucana is a long-lived native conifer from the sub-Antarctic Andean forests of South America. Currently, the species is classified as endangered due to fragmentation, deforestation and increasing fire events affecting southern Chile. Although fire is a key factor shaping the dynamics of A. araucana forests, the impact of fire on the chemical and microbiological soil properties remains elusive. Here, we aimed to characterize the (bio)chemical and microbiological soil traits in different sites of the Andes and the Coastal range of southern Chile, as a way to describe the conservation status of A. araucana forests in contrasting environments with different fire history. The study was conducted in old-growth A. araucana forests within protected areas affected by different fire events during the last 18 years. Roots were analyzed for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization and soil samples were processed for (bio)chemical and microbiological analyses. Our results revealed that AM colonization was strongly affected by fire, being closely related with the acid phosphatase and β-glucosidase enzymatic activities, which also showed lower values in fire-affected sites. Glomalin-related protein in the soil was also a good indicator of soil stability associated to environments non-affected by fire. Based on our results, the conservation status benchmark for A. araucana is in the Coastal range, showing high rates of AM colonization, fungal structures and biochemical activities in environments subjected to minor geological risks and no fire events. This research provides helpful information for finding efficient biological inoculants, including indigenous AM fungal species, which can help to enhance A. araucana plantlets with an optimized rhizosphere oriented to the restoration of burned A. araucana forests in south-central Chile. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={Microbial mats are complex communities that represent a large biomass fraction in non-marine Antarctic ecosystems. They confer structure to soils and constitute, by themselves, intricate microecosystems, where a great variety of microorganisms and microfauna contributes to the ecosystem functions. Although in recent years Antarctic microbial mats have been thoroughly investigated, trophic relationships within the communities remain unresolved. We therefore conducted a study of the trophic relationships of a microbial mat from Byers Peninsula, Antarctica, using DNA analysis and stable isotopes as trophic tracers. Our results suggested, based on a Bayesian mixing model, that at least four trophic levels are present within this microecosystem: Primary producers (cyanobacteria and diatoms), primary consumers (rotifers and tardigrades), secondary consumers (nematodes) and decomposers (fungi). Nematodes would play a key role as top consumers of the community, connecting the two carbon inputs described into the system, as omnivores at the secondary trophic level. In addition, carbon pathways from primary trophic level to consumers take place quickly during the first 24 h after its incorporation in the primary producers, dispersing across all the trophic levels and reaching secondary consumers in less than 11 days. This suggests that, given the changing physical conditions and presumably short periods of activity, there is a fine temporal coupling among the organisms in the community, minimizing the redundancy in function performance among trophic levels. © 2019 Almela, Velázquez, Rico, Justel and Quesada.},

  abstract={As Arctic soils warm, thawed permafrost releases nitrogen (N) that could stimulate plant productivity and thus offset soil carbon losses from tundra ecosystems. Although mycorrhizal fungi could facilitate plant access to permafrost-derived N, their exploration capacity beyond host plant root systems into deep, cold active layer soils adjacent to the permafrost table is unknown. We characterized root-associated fungi (RAF) that colonized ericoid (ERM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) shrub roots and occurred below the maximum rooting depth in permafrost thaw-front soil in tussock and shrub tundra communities. We explored the relationships between root and thaw front fungal composition and plant uptake of a 15N tracer applied at the permafrost boundary. We show that ERM and ECM shrubs associate with RAF at the thaw front providing evidence for potential mycelial connectivity between roots and the permafrost boundary. Among shrubs and tundra communities, RAF connectivity to the thaw boundary was ubiquitous. The occurrence of particular RAF in both roots and thaw front soil was positively correlated with 15N recovered in shrub biomass Taxon-specific RAF associations could be a mechanism for the vertical redistribution of deep, permafrost-derived nutrients, which may alleviate N limitation and stimulate productivity in warming tundra. © 2019 The Authors.

  abstract={The extreme weather conditions in the Antarctic have exerted selective pressures favoring differential features in bacteria to survive this untapped environment (i.e., antibiotic molecules). Notably, higher chances of antibiotic discovery from extremophiles have been proposed recently. Although new organic and environmentally friendly sources for helping in the control of plant pathogenic fungi are necessary, the information about anti-phytopathogenic applications of extremophile microorganisms from untapped environments is limited. In this study, we determined the antifungal effect of actinobacterial strains isolated from Antarctic soils and sediments. Co-culture inhibition assays and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) determination revealed that all Antarctic strains (x28) can inhibit the growth of at least one phytopathogenic fungi including Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis sp. and Phytophthora infestans. Additionally, new novel antagonistic relationships are reported. Our work establishes a precedent on Antarctic actinobacteria strains with the capacity to produce antifungal compounds, and its potential for developing new fungicides or biocontrol agents solving current agriculture problems. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

  abstract={Climate warming in the Arctic and the thawing of frozen carbon stocks are leading to uncertainty as to how bacterial communities will respond, including pollutant degrading bacteria. This study investigated the effects of carbon stimulation and temperature on soil microbial community diversity and explosive biodegradation in two sub-Arctic soils. Chitin as a labile carbon source stimulated overall microbial activities as reflected by increases in basal respiration (three to tenfold) and potential nitrification activity (two to fourfold) compared to unamended soil. This stimulation extended to 2,4-dinitroluene- (DNT) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)-degrading microorganisms either directly or via co-metabolic reaction mechanisms. A stimulatory effect of the incubation temperature (2, 12, or 22 °C) on these microbial activities was also observed, but the chitin stimulation caused greater shifts in the structure of the bacterial and fungal communities. The first reported occurrence of an associated role of chitinolytic bacteria belonging to Cellulomonadaceae and chitinolytic fungi belonging to Mortierellaceae in explosive biodegradation is described. This study found that sub-Arctic soil microbial communities were adapted to respond quickly to an increase in labile carbon sources over the range of temperatures used in this study. The warming climate in the Arctic could benefit explosive contaminated soil clean-up by providing non-recalcitrant carbon sources that stimulate overall microbial activity and correspondingly explosive biodegradation. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

  abstract={The identification of the diversity of microscopic fungi of lithobiont communities of the Argentine Islands in specimens collected during the 22nd Ukrainian Antarctic Expedition was the purpose of this work. Samples of rock, soil, mosses and lichens of rock micro-habitats of "Crustose lichen sub-formation and fruticose lichen and moss cushion sub-formation" were used in the work. These samples were used for extracting and cultivation of filamentous fungi on dense nutrient media. Determination of physiological and biochemical characteristics and identification of yeast-like fungi were performed using a microbiological analyser 'Vitek-2' ('Bio Merieux', France). Cultivation of microorganisms was carried out at temperatures from +2 to +37 °C. In results cultures of microscopic fungi of Zygomycota (Mucor circinelloides), Ascomycota (species of the genera cf. Thelebolus, Talaromyces), representatives of the Anamorphic fungi group (Geomyces pannorum, species of the genera Alternaria, Acremonium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium) were isolated from Antarctic samples. Microscopic fungi Penicillium spp. were dominated after the frequency in the studied samples (54.5%). Rhodotorula rubra and Candida sp. among isolated yeast fungi, and dark pigmented fungi represented by Aureobasidium pullulans and Exophiala spp. were identified. The biological properties of a number of isolated fungi (the potential ability to synthesise important biologically active substances: Melanins, carotenoids, lipids) are characterised. Mycobiota of rock communities of Argentine Islands is rich on filamentous and yeast fungi similarly to other regions of Antarctica. A number of fungi investigated are potentially able to synthesise biologically active substances. The dark pigmented species of the genera Cladosporium, Exophiala, Aureobasidium pullulans, capable of melanin synthesis; 'red' yeast Rhodotorula rubra (carotenoid producers and resistant to toxic metals); Mucor circinelloides and Geomyces pannorum, lipid producers, are among these fungi. Yeast-like fungi assimilated a wide range of carbohydrates, which will allow them to be further used for cultivation in laboratory and process conditions. The collection of technologically promising strains of microorganisms, part of the Culture Collection of Fungi at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (Ukraine), is updated with isolated species (strains) of filamentous fungi and yeast-potential producers of biologically active substances, obtained within this study. © 2020 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

The main symbionts of Placopsis species are examined for 56 specimens collected from the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica using molecular (fungal and algal nrITS, fungal RPB1, algal rbcL sequences) and morphological methods. The specimens were collected from soils with different deglaciation times. Eight uni-algal photobiont cultures were obtained and analysed from two specimens. Placopsis antarctica and P. contortuplicata proved to be monophyletic and are sister species, only the former producing vegetative diaspores (soredia). Both share the same photobiont pool and are lichenized with two closely related species, Stichococcus antarcticus and S. allas. Two haplotypes of S. antarcticus are restricted to areas deglaciated for more than 5000 years and the volcanic Deception Island indicating a shift in the photobionts of Placopsis in the course of the soil and lichen community development. These photobiont haplotypes exhibit different ecological preferences, possibly leading to adaptation of the symbiotic entity to changing environmental conditions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

  abstract={The basidiomycetous yeast Moesziomyces antarcticus (often cited as Pseudozyma antarctica), originally isolated from a sediment sample obtained from Lake Vanda in Antarctica, was asexually typified but closely related to the smut fungus Moesziomyces bullatus (Ustilaginales). We found a smut fungus on an ovary of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) in Japan, which had been identified as M. bullatus. The teliospores germinated and formed yeast-like colonies. Physiological and phylogenetic studies revealed that the characteristics of the yeast-like isolates coincided with those of “P. antarctica.” We thus recognised the smut fungus as the teleomorph of M. antarcticus, and then emended the description of M. antarcticus based on the holomorph. The identified fungus could degrade certain biodegradable plastics and produce mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) in similar qualities as the “P. antarctica” type strain. This discovery provides a significant bioresource, as genetically diverse M. antarcticus isolates could be obtained from the smut fungus. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Picrorrhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth is distinguished endangered medicinal herb, naturally distributed in alpine and sub-alpine region of Himalayas. In present investigation, spores density of AM fungi along root colonization were studied from the rhizospheric soils of P. kurroa collected from different locations of Himachal Pradesh. Highest spore number (60) was found in the soil samples collected from forest nursery Rajkunda while AM root space colonization was highest in the samples of forest nursery Devidhar. The biodiversity of AM fungi was studied; the number of AM species was also highest in these two forest nursery samples. Funneliformis mosseae and Acaulospora laevis were dominant species associated with P. kurroa. After mass multiplication of F. mosseae and A. laevis, bio-inoculation experiment was performed onPicrorrhiza kurroaseedlings for the biomass production and nutrient uptake analysis. Seedlings were inoculated with single and in combined mycorrhizal treatments with different combinations of farmyard manure and vermicompost. All inoculated seedlings showed significant biomass production than control seedlings. Root length (8.7cm), fresh and dry biomass was observed to be maximum in the plants inoculated with F. mosseae and vermicompost @ 10t ha-1 while percent AM root colonization was highest (60.33) in the roots of plants inoculated with F. mosseae plus A. laevis with vermicompost @10t ha-1. The phosphorus content was more in seedlings inoculated with consortium of two native AM fungi followed by F. mosseae and A. laevis, separately. In overall, consortium of native AM fungi i.e. F. mosseae and A. laevis was found to be best for the conservation of the P. kurroa in the presence of vermicompost and FYM, respectively. © 2020, IndianJournals.com.

  abstract={In cold environments such as polar regions, microorganisms play important ecological roles, and most of our knowledge about them comes from studies of cultivable microorganisms. Metagenomic technologies are powerful tools that can give a more comprehensive assessment of microbial communities, and the amplification of rDNA followed by next-generation sequencing has given good results in studies aimed particularly at environmental microorganisms. Culture-independent studies of microbiota in terrestrial habitats of Antarctica, which is considered the driest, coldest climate on Earth, are increasing and indicate that micro-diversity is much higher than previously thought. In this work, the microbial diversity of terrestrial habitats including eight islands of the South Shetland Archipelago, two islands on the Antarctic Peninsula and Union Glacier, was studied by amplicon-metagenome analysis. Molecular analysis of the studied localities clustered together the islands of the South Shetland Archipelago, except Greenwich Island, and separated them from the Litchfield and Lagotellerie islands and Union Glacier, which is in agreement with the latitudinal difference among them. Among fungi, 87 genera and 123 species were found, of which species belonging to 37 fungal genera not previously cultivated from Antarctica were detected. Phylogenetic analysis, including the closest BLAST-hit sequences, clustered fungi in 11 classes being the most represented Lecanoromycetes and Eurotiomycetes. © 2017 Baeza, Barahona, Alcaíno and Cifuentes.},

  abstract={A substantial portion of grassland photosynthates is allocated belowground to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), but controversy remains about whether this carbon (C) contributes to soil organic carbon (SOC) under warming. The goal of this study was to investigate how AMF biomass and C sequestered by AMF (CNew) are influenced by soil warming. We estimated the AMF biomass and CNew, assumed to be mostly AMF necromass, in mycelial ingrowth bags buried for 1, 2, or 3 years in soil under warming (~+0.5–16.4 °C). The AMF biomass had a positive, curvilinear response to warming gradients after one year of burial. About 107 g C m−2 of CNew accumulated over the three years and ~12% of this C was from glomalin-related soil protein. Modelling suggested the production rate of AMF biomass was 153 g C m−2 yr−1 with a rapid (36–75 days) turnover while AMF necromass turnover was much slower (1.4 ± 0.2 yr−1). Warming duration (7–9 years vs. > 50 years) did not have significant influence on AMF biomass or CNew (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that AMF are more tolerant to increases in temperature than other microbes or fine roots. The dramatic loss of soil C and stable soil aggregates under warming found earlier at this site were not attributed to a decrease in AMF biomass or CNew. Despite a low AMF standing biomass, its contribution to SOC may be substantial. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Abstract: The Progress Station is the largest Russian Antarctic station. The anthropogenic impact on primary soils in the area of this station is reflected in the chemical structure of soils and structure of microbial communities. The article shows a multiple increase in the number of microorganisms (especially microscopic fungi) in contaminated soils around the Progress Station. The anthropogenic impact changes the structure of complexes of soil microorganisms. The proportion of mesophilic microorganisms significantly increases under these conditions. Fifty-three micromycete species of 28 genera have been identified in samples of primary soils and anthropogenic substrates. Their diversity decreases from the anthropogenic soils and anthropogenic substrates to the control (“clean”) soils. It is shown that an increase in the number of micromycete species in the area of the polar station results from the invasion of new micromycete species due to human activities. Some native species of micromycetes can adapt to anthropogenic substrates and can be destructors of different introduced materials. Over 56 and 70% among micromycetes from the contaminated soils and anthropogenic substrates, respectively, can be considered potentially pathogenic species. Therefore, invasive processes change the structure of complexes of soil micromycetes, which can serve as an indicator of anthropogenic impact on ecosystems in the Larsemann Hills oasis in East Antarctica. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  abstract={Fungal endophyte associations have been suggested as a possible strategy of Antarctic vascular plants for surviving the extreme environmental conditions of Antarctica. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are still poorly understood. The role of root fungal endophytes in nitrogen mineralization and nutrient uptake, as well as their impact on the performance of Antarctic plants, were studied. We tested root endophytes, isolated from Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, for lignocellulolytic enzyme production, nitrogen mineralization, and growth enhancement of their host plants. Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium brevicompactum were identified using a molecular approach as the main root endophytes inhabiting C. quitensis and D. antarctica, respectively. Both root endophytes were characterized as psychrophilic fungi displaying amylase, esterase, protease, cellulase, hemicellulase, phosphatase and urease enzymatic activities, mainly at 4 °C. Moreover, the rates and percentages of nitrogen mineralization, as well as the final total biomass, were significantly higher in symbiotic C. quitensis and D. antarctica individuals. Our findings suggest that root endophytes exert a pivotal ecological role based not only to breakdown different nutrient sources but also on accelerating nitrogen mineralization, improving nutrient acquisition, and therefore promoting plant growth in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Abstract—: Secondary metabolites of 25 Penicillium strains isolated from high-latitude ecosystems (upper layer of Antarctic soils and Arctic permafrost deposits) were analyzed. Out of the studied strains, 80% were found to produce secondary metabolites belonging to benzodiazepine alkaloids (anacin, cyclopenin, and cyclopeptin), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatin and 3-methoxyviridicatin), diketopiperazine alkaloids (aurantiamine, 3,12-dihydroroquefortine, roquefortine and rugulosuvin B), polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B and chаetoglobosine A), clavine ergot alkaloids (rugulovasins A and B, festuclavine, fumigaclavines A and B, and cyclopiazonic acid), polyketides (mycophenolic acid and citreoviridin), terpenes (andrastins A and B and phomenone), and N-acetyltriptamine. Most strains of the Penicillium subgenus isolated from anthropogenically impaired upper layers of Antarctic deposits and from subsurface Arctic deposits exhibited more complete spectra of secondary metabolites compared to three strains isolated from permafrost 15 000 to 600 000 years old. This is the first report on andrastins formation by a P. restrictum. Wide occurrence of rugulovasins in P. variabile strains was shown. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  abstract={Antarctic cryptoendolithic microbial communities dominate ice-free areas of continental Antarctica, among the harshest environments on Earth. The endolithic lifestyle is a remarkable adaptation to the exceptional environmental extremes of this area, which is considered the closest terrestrial example to conditions on Mars. Recent efforts have attempted to elucidate composition of these extremely adapted communities, but the functionality of these microbes have remained unexplored. We have tested for interactions between measured environmental characteristics, fungal community membership, and inferred functional classification of the fungi present and found altitude and sun exposure were primary factors. Sandstone rocks were collected in Victoria Land, Antarctica along an altitudinal gradient from 834 to 3100 m a.s.l.; differently sun-exposed rocks were selected to test the influence of this parameter on endolithic settlement. Metabarcoding targeting the fungal internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS1) was used to catalogue the species found in these communities. Functional profile of guilds found in the samples was associated to species using FUNGuild and variation in functional groups compared across sunlight exposure and altitude. Results revealed clear dominance of lichenized and stress-tolerant fungi in endolithic communities. The main variations in composition and abundance of functional groups among sites correlated to sun exposure, but not to altitude. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

A total of 44 samples were collected during the Antarctic expeditions from soil, sediments, terrestrial and marine waters and pieces of wood that had been brought into Antarctica. One hundred thirty-seven psychrotrophic fungi were isolated. Thirty-three strains selected from different samples and with different morphological characteristics were used in molecular identification and antimicrobial activity assays. The ability of all isolations to inhibit growth of different bacteria in vitro was tested using the agar plug diffusion method. Most of the fungi identified were Ascomycota with only a few Zygomycota and no Basidiomycota isolated. Twenty-six cultures corresponded to known species. Penicillium was the most represented genus of identified fungal isolations (24 %) followed by species of Cadophora, Mortierella, Pseudogymnoascus and Neurospora.

  abstract={The bacterium, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Pc3, was previously isolated from Antarctic seawater and has been found to show antagonistic activity against the fungus, Rhizoctonia solani ACCC 36316, which causes a severe disease known as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in rapeseed plants. Bacillus lipopeptides had been widely used as biocontrol agents for plant diseases. In this study, we isolated 11 lipopeptide compounds from B. amyloliquefaciens Pc3 culture broth via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to identify these as iturin A (C14, C15, C16, C17), fengycin B (C14, C15, C16, C17), and surfactin (C14, C15, C16). We further found that the addition of exogenous alkanoic acids, including myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, heptadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, and nonadecanoic acid, to the bacterial growth media could promote lipopeptide production and enhance the antifungal activities of crude lipopeptide extracts from B. amyloliquefaciens Pc3. In addition, the transcriptional levels of three lipopeptide synthesis genes, ituD, fenA, and srfA-A, and two fatty acid metabolism–related genes, FabI, which encodes enoyl-ACP reductase, and FadB, which encodes enoyl-CoA hydratase, were found to be upregulated in cells grown with exogenous alkanoic acids. Among the six alkanoic acids tested, those with odd carbon chain lengths had a greater effect on lipopeptide production, antifungal activity, and target gene upregulation than those with even carbon chain lengths. These results provide a practical approach for the efficient production of lipopeptides in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Pc3. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={In recent years, the Arctic has become a hot spot for microbial research. However, fungal diversity in the Chukchi Sea (adjacent to the Arctic Ocean) is little known. The purpose of this study was to explore fungal diversity in sediments of the Chukchi Sea and the temperature adaptability of the cultured fungi. A total of 74 fungal strains were isolated from nine marine sediment samples collected from the Chukchi Sea. These fungi were identified based on morphological characteristics and sequence comparison of the internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) with the GenBank reference sequence database. Amongst these fungi, 61 strains belonged to the Ascomycota and 13 strains were affiliated with the Basidiomycota. The dominant genus was Penicillium. These fungal strains were cultured at 4°C, 10°C, and 25°C to determine their temperature adaptability. Most strains were able to grow at 4°C, and Thelebolus ellipsoideus was identified as a psychrophilic fungus. Our results revealed a high fungal diversity in marine sediments of the Chukchi Sea and found that some fungal species (Penicillium chrysogenum, Eutypella scoparia, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium tenuissimum, C. perangustums and Thelebolus ellipsoideus) isolated from these sediments were able to grow at 10°C and 4°C. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.},

  abstract={Ongoing climate change involves increasing snow scarcity, which results in more frequent freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in polar and alpine soils. Although repeated FTCs have been shown to alter the structure and functions of soil microbial communities, a thorough understanding on the influence of FTCs frequency on polar and especially alpine soil microbiomes is still elusive. Here, we investigated the impact of repeated weekly vs. daily FTC frequencies on the structure and functions of prokaryotic and fungal communities from north- and south-exposed soils from two mountain ridges, one in the Arctic and one in the High-Alps. FTCs affected prokaryotic communities more strongly than fungal communities, where mainly cold-tolerant and opportunistic fungi (e.g., Mrakia, Mortierella) were responsive. Prokaryotic communities were more affected by weekly FTCs than by daily FTCs. Daily FTCs favored fast-growing bacteria (e.g., Arthrobacter), while oligotrophic and largely uncultured taxa (e.g., Verrucomicrobia) benefited from weekly FTCs. FTCs negatively affected microbial respiration but had minor impacts on C-, N- and P-acquiring enzymatic activities. Plausible pre-adaptation of the microbial communities to naturally occurring frequent FTCs at their site of origin did not show a clear influence on the microbial responses to the tested FTCs. Altogether, our study provides an integrative overview on potential structural and functional changes of soil microbial communities in polar and alpine regions in response to the projected increase in FTCs; therefore advancing our understanding on the impact of climate change in these rapidly changing ecosystems. © Copyright © 2020 Perez-Mon, Frey and Frossard.},

  abstract={We recovered 85 fungal isolates from the acid sulphate soils in chronosequence under para-periglacial conditions in King George Island, Antarctica. Thirty-two taxa belonging to the phylum Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota were identified. Mortierella amoeboidea, Mortierella sp. 2, Mortierella sp. 3, Penicillium sp. 2 and Penicillium sp. 3 dominated the sulphite soils. Despite the multi-extreme physic-chemical conditions of the sulphate soils (low pH, variable content of macro and micronutrients and organic matter), the fungal assemblages exhibited moderate diversity indices, which ranged according to the degree of soil development. Soils with more weathered and, consequently, with highest values of organic carbon shelter the most diverse fungal assemblages, which can be associated with the occurrence of sulphurisation and sulphide oxidation. Different taxa of Mortierella and Penicillium displayed broad pH (3–9) and temperature (5–35 °C) plasticity. The multi-extreme sulphite soils of Antarctica revealed the presence of moderate fungal diversity comprising cold cosmopolitan and psychrophilic endemic taxa. Among these, Mortierella and Penicillium, known to survive in extreme conditions such as low temperature and available organic matter, low pH and high concentrations of metals, might represent interesting techniques to be used in biotechnological processes such as bioleaching in metallurgy and phosphate solubilisation in agriculture. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

Plant communities remained stable fromAD1400 until the 1940s,when theDNAof invasive rabbits was detected in sediments. Rabbit detection corresponded to abrupt changes of plant communities,with a continuous decline of a dominant plant species. Furthermore, erosion rate abruptly increased with rabbit abundance. Rabbit impactswere very fast and were stronger than the effects of climate change during the 20th century.

  abstract={Environmental disturbance is an unpreventable consequence of human impact after exploration and research station management in Antarctica. Environmental pollution may directly influence Antarctic mycobiota. However, information about the effect of anthropogenic factors on microscopic fungi at extremely low temperatures is insufficient. This work compared the abundance and the species diversity of mycelial fungi from soils of six Russian research Antarctic stations—Bellingshausen, Progress-2, Druzhnaya-4, Molodezhnaya, Novolazarevskaya and Oasis−affected by various anthropogenic impacts (operation of tracked and wheeled vehicles, storage and use of petroleum products and petroleum leakage sites) with that from their background analogues. New data were obtained on the taxonomic diversity of mycelial fungi from Antarctic soils with different anthropogenic loads. Cultural, morphological and physiological studies of 142 isolated strains of mycelial fungi were supplemented by molecular–biological research into sterile mycelium strains and those with vague morphological characters. This contributed not only to the verification but also to a significant increase in the number of taxa of mycelial fungi isolated from low-temperature ecotopes. Leotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes were found to be the most dominant classes in the studied samples. It was shown that several ecological groups of micromycetes could be isolated among the mycobiota of the investigated habitats, the abundance and species composition of which changed differently under the influence of anthropogenic factors. The current results highlight that microbiota changes in human-affected soils can serve as an indicator of the state of low-temperature ecotopes in general. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Glacier forefields provide a unique chronosequence to assess microbial or plant colonization and ecological succession on previously uncolonized substrates. Patterns of microbial succession in soils of alpine and subpolar glacier forefields are well documented but those affecting high polar systems, including moraine rocks, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we examine succession patterns in pioneering bacterial, fungal and algal communities developing on moraine rocks and soil at the Hurd Glacier forefield (Livingston Island, Antarctica). Over time, changes were produced in the microbial community structure of rocks and soils (ice-free for different lengths of time), which differed between both substrates across the entire chronosequence, especially for bacteria and fungi. In addition, fungal and bacterial communities showed more compositional consistency in soils than rocks, suggesting community assembly in each niche could be controlled by processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales. Microscopy revealed a patchy distribution of epilithic and endolithic lithobionts, and increasing endolithic colonization and microbial community complexity along the chronosequence. We conclude that, within relatively short time intervals, primary succession processes at polar latitudes involve significant and distinct changes in edaphic and lithic microbial communities associated with soil development and cryptogamic colonization. © Copyright © 2020 Garrido-Benavent, Pérez-Ortega, Durán, Ascaso, Pointing, Rodríguez-Cielos, Navarro and de los Ríos.},

  abstract={The development of cold-active biofertilizers and biopesticides could help improve sustainable agriculture in mountainous regions. With this aim, both psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microorganisms have been prospected in cold regions around the world and tested for their plant-growth promoting (PGP) effects. Interestingly, very little is known about the PGP effects of polar microorganisms in commercial crops. This study aimed at isolating cold-active plant-growth promoting Pseudomonas spp. from Antarctic soils and testing their PGP effects, both in vitro and on wheat (Triticum aestivum). Twenty-five Pseudomonas spp. strains isolated from Antarctic soils at Greenwich Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctic Peninsula) were tested. The isolates grew well at temperatures ranging from 4 to 30 °C and were therefore considered as eury-psychrophiles. The isolates solubilized tri-calcium phosphate at 8 and 16 °C in the presence of different sugars as sole carbon sources. Besides producing indole-acetic acid, siderophores and hydrogen cyanide, several isolates inhibited growth of three plant pathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium ultimum and Phytophtora infestans) by means of both soluble- and volatile-secondary metabolites. Bacterization of T. aestivum seeds with selected isolates significantly enhanced root elongation. Moreover, when grown in sterile soil and in a temperature-controlled growth chamber at 14 ± 1 °C, inoculated T. aestivum seedlings showed a significant increase in their root- and shoot-lengths compared to untreated controls. Overall, the results suggest that some of these Antarctic Pseudomonas spp. isolates could act as cold-active biofertilizers. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={In this study, we propose a new genus, Victoriomyces, with a new species, Victoriomyces antarcticus, isolated from soil samples collected in Victoria Land, Antarctica. To determine its taxonomic status and evolutionary relationships, phylogenetic analysis was performed on DNA sequences from the nuclear 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) genes. Victoriomyces antarcticus constitutes one well-supported distinct lineage within the Cephalothecaceae (family incertae sedis in Sordariomycetes), in which the only recognised asexual morphs belong to the genus Phialemonium and to Acremonium thermophilum. Victoriomyces antarcticus can be clearly distinguished from these taxa by means of DNA sequence analysis and its morphological traits that consist in having a Metarhizium-like asexual morph, dark red-coloured disk-like structures, immature bodies and the production of an intense red pigment in the growth media. Finally, we inferred the divergence time of V. antarcticus and the Cephalothecaceae using Bayesian analysis and secondary calibration. The holotype of V. antarcticus is FBL 165. The ex-type strain has been deposited as MUT 3686T and CCF 6158T. An additional strain of the species is FBL 577. The MycoBank number is MB 823713 for the genus and MB 823714 for the species. © 2019 IUMS.},

  abstract={From undisturbed Antarctic habitats (permafrost sediments 30–150 thousand years of age, water of Radok Lake) and superficial deposits contaminated with petroleum products, we isolated 14 and 9 strains of Penicillium fungi, respectively. Comparison of the fungal complexes showed them to differ by species composition; only two species—P. palitans and P. solitum—were in the species lists of both groups. The identified secondary metabolites in the investigated strains belonged to diketopiperazine (group of roquefortines, rugulosuvin B), benzodiazepine (anacin, cyclopenins), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatins), clavine ergot alkaloids (α-cyclopiazonic acid, festuclavine, fumigaclavines), polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B, chaetoglobosin A), amino acid derivatives (N-acetyltryptamine, chrysogins, penicillin G), polyketides (citreoviridin A, mycophenolic acid), and terpenes (andrastins, phomenone). Strains isolated from anthropogenically altered habitats produced a more complete and characteristic profile of exometabolites, as compared with strains isolated from undisturbed habitats. It is only from contaminated soils there were isolated fungi that produced more structurally diverse secondary metabolites pertaining to polycyclic indole alkaloids and terpenoids. The fungi isolated from contaminated samples can be used in biodegradation of oil spills and bioremediation of the environment, and also as producers of promising biologically active compounds. © 2019, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.},

  abstract={The harsh climatic conditions and low levels of human activity in Antarctica, relative to other regions, means few non-native species have established. However, the risk of introductions is becoming greater as human activity increases. Non-native microorganisms can be imported to Antarctica in association with fresh food, cargo and personal clothing, but the likelihood of their establishment is not well understood. In January 2015, a wooden packing crate, heavily contaminated with fungi, was imported by aircraft from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Rothera Research Station, Antarctica. Mucor racemosus Bull. and two strains of Trichoderma viridescens (A.S. Horne & H.S. Will.) Jaklitsch & Samuels were isolated from the wood. Measurements of hyphal extension rates indicated that all three strains were psychrotolerant and capable of growth at 4°C, with M. racemosus growing at 0°C. The imported fungi could grow at rates equivalent to, or faster than, species isolated from Antarctic soils, suggesting that low temperature may not be a limiting factor for establishment. It is recommended that wood heat-treatment standards, equivalent to those described in the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, are employed by national operators importing cargo into Antarctica, and that treated wood is adequately stored to prevent fungal contamination prior to transportation. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2018.},

  abstract={Although research on microbial biogeography has made great progress in the past decade, distributions of terrestrial microbial communities in extreme environments such as Antarctica are not well understood. In addition, knowledge of whether and how historical contingencies affect microbial distributions at small spatial scales is lacking. Here, we analyzed soil-borne microbial (bacterial, archaeal, and fungal) communities in 12 quadrat plots around the Fildes Region of King George Island, maritime Antarctica, and the communities were divided into two groups according to the soil elemental compositions and environmental attributes of Holocene raised beach and Tertiary volcanic stratigraphy. Prokaryotic communities of the two groups were well separated; the prokaryotic data were primarily correlated with soil elemental compositions and were secondly correlated with environmental attributes (e.g., soil pH, total organic carbon, NO3-, and vegetation coverage; Pearson test, r = 0.59 vs. 0.52, both P < 0.01). The relatively high abundance of P, S, Cl, and Br in Group 1 (Holocene raised beach site) was likely due to landform uplift. Lithophile-elements (Si, Al, Ca, Sr, Ti, V, and Fe) correlated with prokaryotic communities in Group 2 may have originated from weathering of Tertiary volcanic rock. No significant correlations were found between the fungal community distribution and both the soil elemental composition and environmental attributes in this study; however, Monte Carlo tests revealed that elements Sr and Ti, soil pH, sampling altitude, and moss and lichen species numbers had significant impacts on fungal communities. The elements and nutrients accumulated during the formation of different landforms influenced the development of soils, plant growth, and microbial communities, and this resulted in small-scale spatially heterogeneous biological distributions. These findings provide new evidence that geological evolutionary processes in the Fildes Region were crucial to its microbial community development, and the results highlight that microbial distribution patterns are the legacies of historical events at this small spatial scale. Based on this study, the ice-free regions in maritime Antarctica represent suitable research sites for studying the influence of geomorphological features on microbial distributions, and we envision the possibility of a site-specific landform assignment through the analysis of the soil prokaryotic community structure. © Copyright © 2018 Zhang, Lu, Chang, Jiang, Gao, Yao, Li, Cao, Zhou and Peng.},

  abstract={Abstract: The biomass of prokaryotes and fungi, organic carbon stocks, and CO2 emission were studied in the Cryosols and Leptosols of Franz Josef Land. The highest carbon stocks were found in the Eutric Leptosols (Loamic, Humic) formed in the wind-sheltered areas (23.2 kg C/m2 in the upper 50 cm), as well as in Turbic Cryosols (Humiс) that contained organic matter buried by cryoturbation (13.7–20.7 kg C/m2). The number of prokaryotes varied between 0.14 and 2.10 billion cells/g of soil, and the maximum values of their biomass were found in the litter. The fungal biomass varied from tens to hundreds of mg/g of soil depending on the type of soil and biotope. The share of spores was more than a half of the total fungal biomass in 80% of cases. Spores and mycelium were mainly represented by small forms with a diameter of up to 2–3 microns. The length of the fungal mycelium ranged from 4 to 272 m/g of soil. The maximum development of fungi was observed in the lichen biocrusts and moss litters. The fungal biomass decreased exponentially with the depth of horizons, and at the same time the share of prokaryotes in microbial biomass increased by several times. The share of microbial carbon in the total organic carbon was higher in soils of barrens (the most extreme habitats among the studied ones) as compared with the soils of local tundra areas (12.7 versus 2.5%, respectively). The levels of СО2 emission from the surface of undisturbed soils varied in the range of 1.6–91.7 mg C–CО2/m2 per hour and differed by tens of times between barrens and tundra areas. The studied soils are close to the soils of the Arctic tundra when compared by their carbon stocks and CO2 emission values; however, their microbial biomass values and their distribution are close to the soils of Antarctica and hot deserts. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

A total of 104 microfungal species have been identified. Seventyseven fungal species have been detected in samples of soils and anthropogenic materials from polar stations of East Antarctica (Progress, Mirny, Molodezhnaya, and Druzhnaya 4) using mycological methods while, in the Bellingshausen station (Subantarctic), we have isolated 87 micromycete species. The number of fungi in soils varies from individual propagules in control soils to 94000 per 1 g of soil in contaminated areas. The largest number of species is represented by the genus Penicillium (26 species). Fungal species that form the core of mycobiota in most of the studied habitats have been identified. For soils of East Antarctica, it is formed by species of the genera Aureobasidium, Cadophora, Pseudogymnoascus (Geomyces), Thelebolus, and Phoma. Significant differences are established between the mycobiota of East Antarctica and that of the Subantarctic. At the same time, a general trend towards an increase in fungal species diversity and number in the areas of polar stations compared to the control (clean) sites for all studied areas is recorded. These data indicate that a significant part of micromycetes is introduced into the Antarctic by humans (anthropogenic invasion). © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

To survive in such environments, microbes such as soil fungi need to compete with or protect themselves effectively from other soil microbiota and to obtain the often scarce nutrients available, and many use secondary metabolites to facilitate this. We therefore (i) screened for antimicrobial properties of cold-environment Arctic and Antarctic soil fungi, and (ii) identified changes in the secreted secondary metabolite profiles of a subset of these strains in response to temperature variation. A total of 40 polar soil fungal strains from King George Island, maritime Antarctic and Hornsund, Svalbard, High Arctic, were obtained from the Malaysian National Antarctic Research Centre culture collections. The plug assay technique was used to screen for antimicrobial potential against Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli). About 45% of the tested fungal strains showed antimicrobial activity against at least one tested microorganism. Three fungal isolates showed good bioactivity and were subjected to secondary metabolite profiling at different temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 28 °C). We observed a range of responses in fungal metabolite production when incubated at varying temperatures, confirming an influence of environmental conditions such as temperature on the production of secondary metabolites. © 2017},

  abstract={Extreme environments such as the Antarctic can lead to the discovery of new microbial taxa, as well as to new microbial-derived natural products. Considering that little is known yet about the diversity and the genetic resources present in these habitats, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the fungal communities from extreme environments collected at Aldmiralty Bay (Antarctica). A total of 891 and 226 isolates was obtained from soil and marine sediment samples, respectively. The most abundant isolates from soil samples were representatives of the genera Leucosporidium, Pseudogymnoascus, and a non-identified Ascomycota NIA6. Metschnikowia sp. was the most abundant taxon from marine samples, followed by isolates from the genera Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus. Many of the genera were exclusive in marine sediment or terrestrial samples. However, representatives of eight genera were found in both types of samples. Data from non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that each sampling site is unique in their physical-chemical composition and fungal community. Biotechnological potential in relation to enzymatic production at low/moderate temperatures was also investigated. Ligninolytic enzymes were produced by few isolates from root-associated soil. Among the fungi isolated from marine sediments, 16 yeasts and nine fungi showed lipase activity and three yeasts and six filamentous fungi protease activity. The present study permitted increasing our knowledge on the diversity of fungi that inhabit the Antarctic, finding genera that have never been reported in this environment before and discovering putative new species of fungi. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={We accessed the culturable mycobiota present in marine sediments at different depths in Antarctica Ocean. Acremonium fusidioides, Penicillium allii-sativi, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium palitans, Penicillium solitum, and Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus were identified. Penicillium allii-sativi was the dominant species. At least one isolate of each species was capable to present antifungal, trypanocidal, leishmanicidal, antimalarial, nematocidal, or herbicidal activities. Penicillium produced extracts with strong trypanocidal and antimalarial activities, and the extracts of P. solitum and P. chrysogenum demonstrated strong antimalarial activities. Acremonium fusidioides and P. verrucosus displayed strong selective herbicidal properties. The 1H NMR signals for extracts of A. fusidioides, P. chrysogenum, and P. solitum indicated the presence of highly functionalized secondary metabolites, which may be responsible for the biological activities detected. In the deep marine Antarctic sediments, we detected fungal assemblages in which the Penicillium species were found to be dominant and demonstrated capabilities to survive and/or colonise that poly-extreme habitat. Penicillium being a polyextremophile Antarctic species, exhibited strong biological activities and the presence of aromatic compounds in its extracts may indicate that they are wild ancient strains with high genetic and biochemical potentials that enable them to produce bioactive compounds which can be researched in further studies and used in the chemotherapy of neglected tropical diseases as well as in agriculture. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={The presence of fungi in pristine Antarctic soils is of particular interest because of the diversity of this microbial group. However, the extreme conditions that coexist in Antarctica produce a strong selective pressure that could lead to the evolution of novel mechanisms for stress tolerance by indigenous microorganisms. For this reason, in recent years, research on cold-adapted microorganisms has increased, driven by their potential value for applications in biotechnology. Cold-adapted fungi, in particular, have become important sources for the discovery of novel bioactive secondary metabolites and enzymes. In this study, we studied the fungal community structure of 12 soil samples from Antarctic sites, including King George Island (including Collins Glacier), Deception Island and Robert Island. Culturable fungi were isolated and described according to their morphological and phenotypical characteristics, and the richness index was compared with soil chemical properties to describe the fungal community and associated environmental parameters. We isolated 54 fungal strains belonging to the following 19 genera: Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, Lambertella, Cadophora, Candida, Mortierella, Oxygenales, Geomyces, Vishniacozyma, Talaromyces, Rhizopus, Antarctomyces, Cosmospora, Tetracladium, Leptosphaeria, Lecanicillium, Thelebolus, Bjerkandera and an uncultured Zygomycete. The isolated fungi were comprised of 70% Ascomycota, 10% Zygomycota, 10% Basidiomycota, 5% Deuteromycota and 5% Mucoromycota, highlighting that most strains were associated with similar genera grown in cold environments. Among the culturable strains, 55% were psychrotrophic and 45% were psychrophilic, and most were Ascomycetes occurring in their teleomorph forms. Soils from the Collins Glacier showed less species richness and greater species dominance compared with the rest of the sites, whereas samples 4, 7, and 10 (from Fildes Bay, Coppermine Peninsula and Arctowski Station, respectively) showed greater species richness and less species dominance. Species richness was related to the C/N ratio, whereas species dominance was inversely related to C and N content. Thus, the structure of the fungal community was mainly related to soil chemical parameters more than sample location and altitude. © 2019 Durán, Barra, Jorquera, Viscardi, Fernandez, Paz, Mora and Bol.},

  abstract={Lichens are miniature ecosystems that contain fungi, microalgae, and bacteria. It is generally accepted that symbiosis between mycobiont and photobiont and microbial contribution to the ecosystem support the wide distribution of lichens in terrestrial ecosystems, including polar areas. The composition of symbiotic components can be affected by subtle microenvironmental differences within a thallus, as well as large-scale climate differences. In this study, we investigated fine-scale profiles of algal, fungal, and bacterial compositions through horizontal and vertical positions of the Antarctic lichen Cladonia squamosa colonies by next-generation sequencing of the nuclear large subunit rRNA gene (nucLSU) of eukaryotes and the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria. Apical parts of thalli were exposed to strong light, low moisture, and high variability of temperature compared with basal parts. Microbial diversity increased from apical parts to basal parts of thalli. Asterochloris erici was the major photobiont in apical positions of thalli, but other microalgal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae were major microalgal components in basal positions. Photochemical responses of algal components from apical and basal parts of thalli were quite different under variable temperature and humidity conditions. Several fungal OTUs that belonged to Arthoniomycetes and Lecanoromycetes, and diverse bacterial OTUs that belonged to Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria_Gp1, and candidate division WPS-2 showed a clear distribution pattern according to their vertical positions within thalli. The overall lichen microbiome was significantly differentiated by the vertical position within a thallus. These results imply that different microclimate are formed at different lichen thallus parts, which can affect microbial compositions and physiological responses according to positions within the thalli. © Copyright © 2020 Noh, Lee, Park, Lee, Cho and Hong.},

  abstract={Aim. The isolation of actinomycetes from Deschampsia antarctica É. Desv. (Galindez Island, Antarctica) rhiso-sphere and determine their ability to produce compounds with antimicrobial and plant growth promotional properties. Meth-ods. Actinomycetes were isolated using the three different methods: direct inoculation, the roots treatment with an aqueous solution of phenol and heated at 100 °C for 60 minutes. To study the antibacterial activity of actinomycetes, they were plated on the Oatmeal medium and flooded by 0,7% agar with specific test-culture. Antifungal activities were studied by putting the agar block with fungal culture on Petri plates with cultures of actinomycetes. An activity index was determined by the ratio of the diameter zone of the inhibit growth test-cultures to the diameter of the actinomycetes colonies. Plant growth promotion properties were studied by commonly accepted methods. Results. 35 psychotolerant isolates were identified among the 43 actinomy-cetes isolated from D. antarctica rhizosphere. Almost 42% of actinomycetes isolates were antagonists at least one of typical strain of phytopathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. phaseolicola, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, Agrobacterium tumifaciens, Erwinia amylovora) or fungi (Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria alternata). An activity index of most isolates was 3—6, in some isolates — 30—32. The potential plant growth promotion properties of isolates were evaluated. 11 isolates of actinomycetes produced indolyl-3-acetic acid (the level of synthesis was 21,0—62,5 μg/ml), 27 isolates produced si-derophores and 6 isolates solubilized phosphorus compounds. Conclusions. Antimicrobial and plant growth promotional properties of the actinomycetes from rhizosphere D. antarctica were evaluated. Phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi antagonists were identified. A number of isolates were characterized by plant growth promotional properties that are combined with the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds. Such properties of isolated actinomycetes may play an important role in the adaptation of Antarctic plants to extreme conditions of existence. The described actinomycetes can be a source of new biologically active compounds and genes that control their biosynthesis. © 2019, State Institution National Antarctic Scientific Center of the Ministry of Education.

  abstract={A preliminary screening to determine the production of bioactive compounds to control plant pathogenic fungi that belong to the genera Alternaria, Botrytis, Fusarium and Phoma was examined for eight actinomycete strains isolated from Andean and Antarctic soils. Phylogenetic analyses of partial sequences of the 16S rDNA gene showed that five strains were closely related to Streptomyces fildesensis GW25-5T, two to Streptomyces griseus ISP 5236T and one to Streptomyces olivochromogenes DSM 40451T. Only one actinomycete strain could inhibit the growth of all four pathogens while the rest had different degrees of control. The best results were obtained for the plant pathogens Alternaria and Phoma since all the actinomycetes could stop their growth. For Fusarium, only the S. griseus strains were able to show efficiency in controlling it. This study shows that actinomycetes are a prolific source of bioactive compounds. © 2018 Chiriotti Editori.

  abstract={Lichens are symbiotic associations consisting of a fungal (mycobiont) and one or more photosynthetic (photobionts) partners and are the dominant component, and most important primary producers, of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. The most common lichens in the maritime Antarctic are Usnea antarctica and U. aurantiacoatra, a so-called “species pair” in which U. antarctica shows asexual reproduction and propagation via soredia and U. aurantiacoatra forms ascospores in apothecia. Previous molecular analyses were not able to unambiguously distinguish the two morphotypes as species. Therefore, the goal of this study was to find out whether fast-evolving SSR (single sequence repeat) markers are able to separate morphotypes more clearly and help to clarify their taxonomy. We investigate 190 individuals from five mixed stands of both morphotypes collected in King George Island and Elephant Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica). Based on 23 microsatellite markers designed from sequenced genomes, discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), Bayesian clustering analysis, and coalescent-based estimation of gene flow show clear evidence for the existence of two different species distinguishable by reproductive mode. We did not detect any statistical association between genetic clusters and three previously reported chemical races of each species. © 2018, © 2018 The Mycological Society of America.},

  abstract={Metagenomics uses nucleic acid sequencing to characterize species diversity in different niches such as environmental biomes or the human microbiome. Most studies have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify bacteria. However, the decreasing cost of sequencing has resulted in a gradual shift away from amplicon analyses and towards shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Shotgun metagenomic data can be used to identify a wide range of species, but have rarely been applied to fungal identification. Here, we develop a sequence classification pipeline, FindFungi, and use it to identify fungal sequences in public metagenome datasets. We focus primarily on animal metagenomes, especially those from pig and mouse microbiomes. We identified fungi in 39 of 70 datasets comprising 71 fungal species. At least 11 pathogenic species with zoonotic potential were identified, including Candida tropicalis. We identified Pseudogymnoascus species from 13 Antarctic soil samples initially analyzed for the presence of bacteria capable of degrading diesel oil. We also show that Candida tropicalis and Candida loboi are likely the same species. In addition, we identify several examples where contaminating DNA was erroneously included in fungal genome assemblies. © 2018 Donovan et al.

  abstract={Soil food webs of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica are simple. These include primary trophic levels of mosses, algae, cyanobacteria, bacteria, archaea, and fungi, and their protozoan and metazoan consumers (including relatively few species of nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, and microarthropods). These biota are patchily distributed across the landscape, with greatest faunal biodiversity associated with wet soil. Understanding trophic structure is critical to studies of biotic interactions and distribution; yet, McMurdo Dry Valley soil food web structure has been inferred from limited laboratory culturing and microscopic observations. To address this, we measured stable isotope natural abundance ratios of C (13C/12C) and N (15N/14N) for different metazoan taxa (using whole body biomass) to determine soil food web structure in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Nitrogen isotopes were most useful in differentiating trophic levels because they fractionated predictably at higher trophic levels. Using 15N/14N, we found that three trophic levels were present in wet soil habitats. While cyanobacterial mats were the primary trophic level, the nematode Plectus murrayi, tardigrade Acutuncus antarcticus, and rotifers composed a secondary trophic level of grazers. Eudorylaimus antarcticus had a 15N/14N ratio that was 2–4‰ higher than that of grazers, indicating that this species is the sole member of a tertiary trophic level. Understanding the trophic positions of soil fauna is critical to predictions of current and future species interactions and their distributions for the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={The active layer of soil overlaying permafrost in the Arctic is subjected to annual changes in temperature and soil chemistry, which we hypothesize to affect the overall soil microbial community. We investigated changes in soil microorganisms at different temperatures during warming and freezing of the active layer soil from Svalbard, Norway. Soil community data were obtained by direct shotgun sequencing of total extracted RNA. No changes in soil microbial communities were detected when warming from −10 to −2 °C or when freezing from −2 to −10 °C. In contrast, within a few days we observed changes when warming from −2 to +2 °C with a decrease in fungal rRNA and an increase in several OTUs belonging to Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria. Even more substantial changes occurred when incubating at 2 °C for 16 days, with declines in total fungal potential activity and decreases in oligotrophic members from Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria. Additionally, we detected an increase in transcriptome sequences of bacterial phyla Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria—collectively presumed to be copiotrophic. Furthermore, we detected an increase in putative bacterivorous heterotrophic flagellates, likely due to predation upon the bacterial community via grazing. Although this grazing activity may explain relatively large changes in the bacterial community composition, no changes in total 16S rRNA gene copy number were observed and the total RNA level remained stable during the incubation. Together, these results are showing the first comprehensive ecological evaluation across prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities on thawing and freezing of soil by application of the TotalRNA technique. © 2019, International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

  abstract={This study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from Antarctica and assess its potential antibacterial activity on Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, the agent of citrus canker. Metabolites production was conducted in Malt 2% broth at 15°C for 20 days after which intracellular and extracellular extracts were obtained. The extracts were evaluated by cell viability assays through Resazurin Microtitre Assay. From 158 fungal extracts, 33 hampered bacterial growth in vitro. The average inhibition of the extracts obtained from terrestrial (soil) and marine (sediments) fungi was 94 and 97% respectively. These inhibition values were close to the average of 90% cell death for the positive control. MIC90 and MBC for the bioactive extracts were established. Isolates that produced active metabolites against the phytopathogen were identified using molecular taxonomy (ITS-rRNA sequencing) as: Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium, Cadophora, Paraconiothyrium and Toxicocladosporium. Antarctic fungal strains isolated from terrestrial and marine sediments were able to produce secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. citri subsp. citri, highlighting the importance of these microbial genetic resources. These metabolites have potential to be used as alternatives for the control of this plant pathogen. Significance and Impact of the Study: This manuscript makes an impact on the study of micro-organisms from extreme habitats and their possible contribution in discovering new active molecules against pathogens of agricultural interest. Studies on the Antarctic continent and its communities have attracted the scientific community due to the long period of isolation and low levels of disturbance that surrounds the region. Knowing the potential of fungi in this region to produce active secondary metabolites, we aim to contribute to the discovery of compounds with antibacterial action in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, a plant pathogen present in several regions around the globe. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

In total, 313 microorganisms were isolated from 52 soil samples from the Arctic region (Spitsbergen). Among the isolated microorganisms, 121 (38.66%) showed biodegradation activity. The ability of clear zone formation on emulsified poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) was observed for 116 microorganisms (95.87%), on poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) for 73 microorganisms (60.33%), and on poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) for 102 microorganisms (84.3%). Moreover, the growth of microorganisms on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) agar plates was observed for 56 microorganisms (46.28%). Based on the 16S rRNA sequence, 10 bacterial strains which showed the highest ability for biodegradation were identified as species belonging to Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodococcus sp. The isolated fungal strains were tested for polycaprolactone films and commercial corn and potato starch bags degradation under laboratory conditions. Strains 16G (based on the analysis of a partial 18S rRNA sequence, identified as Clonostachys rosea) and 16H (identified as Trichoderma sp.) showed the highest capability for biodegradation. A particularly high capability for biodegradation was observed for the strain Clonostachys rosea, which showed 100% degradation of starch films and 52.91% degradation of PCL films in a 30-day shake flask experiment. The main advantage of the microorganisms isolated from Arctic environment is the ability to grow at low temperature and efficient biodegradation under this condition. The data suggest that C. rosea can be used in natural and laboratory conditions for degradations of bioplastics. © 2017, The Author(s).},

  abstract={We characterized the diversity of cultivable fungal assemblages associated with the bryospheres of the bipolar mosses Polytrichastrum alpinum and Polytrichastrum juniperinum resident in King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctica. From different parts of the mosses, 160 fungal isolates were obtained and identified using molecular biology methods as 43 taxa of 28 distinct genera. Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Mrakia gelida, Pseudogymnoascus sp., Melanodiplodia sp., and Vishniacozyma victoriae were the dominant taxa and displayed the highest values of frequency. Ecological diversity indices showed that the fungal assemblages were high but ranged among the mosses. Fungi of the bryospheres of both mosses showed different colonization patterns. Only A. psychrotrophicus, M. gelida, Pseudogymnoascus sp., and Leotiomycetidae sp. occurred as endophytes, epiphytes, and in the rhizoidosphere of P. alpinum. In contrast, the bryosphere of P. juniperinum did not show a single common fungus across its different portions. Our results show that the bryosphere of the bipolar Antarctic mosses seem to represent an interesting hostspot of fungal diversity dominated by cosmopolitan cold-adapted and endemic species recognized as symbionts and decomposer species. The high fungal diversity detected suggests that the Antarctic mosses may offer a protected microhabitat (bryosphere) favorable for the survival, dispersal, and colonization of symbionts and decomposer fungi in the different extreme environments of Antarctica. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Polar systems are experiencing rapid climate change and the high sensitivity of these Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems make them especially vulnerable to accelerated ecological transformation. In Antarctica, warming results in a mosaic of ice-free terrestrial habitats dominated by a diverse assemblage of cryptogamic plants (i.e. mosses and lichens). Although these plants provide key habitat for a wide array of microorganisms and invertebrates, we have little understanding of the interaction between trophic levels in this terrestrial ecosystem and whether there are functional effects of plant species on higher trophic levels that may alter with warming. Here, we used open top chambers on Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, to examine the effects of passive warming and moss species on the abiotic environment and ultimately on higher trophic levels. For the dominant mosses, Polytrichastrum alpinum and Sanionia georgicouncinata, we found species-specific effects on the abiotic environment, including moss canopy temperature and soil moisture. In addition, we found distinct shifts in sexual expression in P. alpinum plants under warming compared to mosses without warming, and invertebrate communities in this moss species were strongly correlated with plant reproduction. Mosses under warming had substantially larger total invertebrate communities, and some invertebrate taxa were influenced differentially by moss species. However, warmed moss plants showed lower fungal biomass than control moss plants, and fungal biomass differed between moss species. Our results indicate that continued warming may impact the reproductive output of Antarctic moss species, potentially altering terrestrial ecosystems dynamics from the bottom up. Understanding these effects requires clarifying the foundational, mechanistic role that individual plant species play in mediating complex interactions in Antarctica’s terrestrial food webs. © 2019 The Authors.

The part of opportunistic fungi in contaminated soil increased in comparison with the background soil. The reduction of dark-colored fungi biomass in contaminated soil was noted. In total, 56 species of eukaryotic algae and 7 species of cyanobacteria were found. Among green algae, the species from families Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae dominated in all plots. In the zones of maximum and strong contamination, 53 algae species were found including xanthophytes, which were absent in unpolluted areas. The number of viable cells in the litter of the maximum contaminated soils varied from 100 thousand to 1.5 million in 1 g of absolutely dry soil. The species composition of algae and cyanobacteria in these soils showed the characteristic features of the Arctic biological soil crusts. © 2020 EMUNI Press.},

  abstract={To obtain chitinase-producing microorganisms with high chitinolytic activity at low temperature, samples collected from Fildes Peninsula in Antarctica were used as sources for bioprospecting of chitinolytic microorganisms. A cold-adapted strain, designated as GWSMS-1, was isolated from marine sediment and further characterized as Pseudomonas. To improve the chitinase production, one-factor-at-a-time and orthogonal test approaches were adopted to optimize the medium components and culture conditions. The results showed that the highest chitinolytic activity (6.36 times higher than that before optimization) was obtained with 95.41 U L−1 with 15 g L−1 of glucose, 1 g L−1 of peptone, 15 g L−1 of colloid chitin and 0.25 g L−1 of magnesium ions contained in the medium, cultivated under pH 7.0 and a temperature of 20 ◦C. To better understand the application potential of this strain, the enzymatic properties and the antifungal activity of the crude chitinase secreted by the strain were further investigated. The crude enzyme showed the maximum catalytic activity at 35 ◦C and pH 4.5, and it also exhibited excellent low-temperature activity, which still displayed more than 50% of its maximal activity at 0 ◦C. Furthermore, the crude chitinase showed significant inhibition of fungi Verticillium dahlia CICC 2534 and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum CICC 2532, which can cause cotton wilt and cucumber blight, respectively, suggesting that strain GWSMS-1 could be a competitive candidate for biological control in agriculture, especially at low temperature. © 2019 by the authors.},

These consisted of 22 taxa of 15 different genera belonging to the Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Mortierella, Antarctomyces, Pseudogymnoascus, and Penicillium were the most frequently isolated genera and Penicillium tardochrysogenum, Penicillium verrucosus, Goffeauzyma gilvescens, and Mortierella sp. 2 the most abundant taxa. All fungal isolates were cultivated using solid-state fermentation to obtain their crude extracts. Pseudogymnoascus destructans, Mortierella parvispora, and Penicillium chrysogenum displayed antiparasitic activities, whilst extracts of P. destructans, Mortierella amoeboidea, Mortierella sp. 3, and P. tardochrysogenum showed herbicidal activities. Reported as pathogenic for bats, different isolates of P. destructans exhibited trypanocidal activities and herbicidal activity, and may be a source of bioactive molecules to be considered for chemotherapy against neglected tropical diseases. The abundant presence of P. destructans in soils of the four islands gives evidence supporting that soils in the Antarctic Peninsula constitute a natural source of strains of this genus, including some P. destructans strains that are phylogenetically close to those that infect bats in North America and Europe/Palearctic Asia. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Background: Climate models predict substantial changes in temperature and precipitation patterns across Arctic regions, including increased winter precipitation as snow in the near future. Soil microorganisms are considered key players in organic matter decomposition and regulation of biogeochemical cycles. However, current knowledge regarding their response to future climate changes is limited. Here, we explore the short-term effect of increased snow cover on soil fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in two tundra sites with contrasting water regimes in Greenland. In order to assess seasonal variation of microbial communities, we collected soil samples four times during the plant-growing season. Results: The analysis revealed that soil microbial communities from two tundra sites differed from each other due to contrasting soil chemical properties. Fungal communities showed higher richness at the dry site whereas richness of prokaryotes was higher at the wet tundra site. We demonstrated that fungal and bacterial communities at both sites were significantly affected by short-term increased snow cover manipulation. Our results showed that fungal community composition was more affected by deeper snow cover compared to prokaryotes. The fungal communities showed changes in both taxonomic and ecological groups in response to climate manipulation. However, the changes were not pronounced at all sampling times which points to the need of multiple sampling in ecosystems where environmental factors show seasonal variation. Further, we showed that effects of increased snow cover were manifested after snow had melted. Conclusions: We demonstrated rapid response of soil fungal and bacterial communities to short-term climate manipulation simulating increased winter precipitation at two tundra sites. In particular, we provide evidence that fungal community composition was more affected by increased snow cover compared to prokaryotes indicating fast adaptability to changing environmental conditions. Since fungi are considered the main decomposers of complex organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems, the stronger response of fungal communities may have implications for organic matter turnover in tundra soils under future climate. © 2019 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Subaerial endolithic systems of the current extreme environments on Earth provide exclusive insight into emergence and development of soils in the Precambrian when due to various stresses on the surfaces of hard rocks the cryptic niches inside them were much more plausible habitats for organisms than epilithic ones. Using an actualistic approach we demonstrate that transformation of silicate rocks by endolithic organisms is one of the possible pathways for the beginning of soils on Earth. This process led to the formation of soil-like bodies on rocks in situ and contributed to the raise of complexity in subaerial geosystems. Endolithic systems of East Antarctica lack the noise from vascular plants and are among the best available natural models to explore organo-mineral interactions of a very old "phylogenetic age" (cyanobacteria-to-mineral, fungi-to-mineral, lichen-to-mineral). On the basis of our case study from East Antarctica we demonstrate that relatively simple endolithic systems of microbial and/or cryptogamic origin that exist and replicate on Earth over geological time scales employ the principles of organic matter stabilization strikingly similar to those known for modern full-scale soils of various climates. © 2018 The Author(s).},

Sixty fungal extracts displayed at least one biological activity against the evaluated targets. Among them, Pseudogymnoascus destructans showed selective trypanocidal activity, Cladosporium sp. 1 and Trichoderma polysporum showed antifungal activity, and Pseudogymnoascus appendiculatus and Helotiales sp. showed high herbicidal activity. We detected a rich and diverse fungal community composed of cold cosmopolitan and psychrophilic endemic taxa recognized as decomposers, symbiotics, pathogens, and potential new species, in the sediments of Antarctic lakes. The dynamics and balance of this fungal community represents an interesting aquatic web model for further ecological and evolutionary studies under extreme conditions and potential climate changes in the regions.

  abstract={The inactivation of quorum sensing signals, a phenomenon known as quorum quenching, has been described in diverse microorganisms, though it remains almost unexplored in yeasts. Beyond the well-known properties of these microorganisms for the industry or as eukaryotic models, the role of yeasts in soil or in the inner tissues of a plant is largely unknown. In this report, the wider survey of quorum quenching activities in yeasts isolated from Antarctic soil and the inner tissues of sugarcane, a tropical crop, is presented. Results show that, independently of their niche, quorum quenching activities are broadly present in unicellular fungi. Although yeasts showing a broad range of quorum quenching activity are present in the two niches, at the same time specific AHL inactivation profiles can also be found. Furthermore, yeasts from both sampling sites show quorum quenching activities compatible with lactonase-like and acylase-like inactivations of AHLs. Interestingly, the characterization of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa 7Apo1 showed that the presence of a particular AHL does not interfere with the quenching of a second molecule. Evidence suggests that yeasts could play a role in the modulation of the quorum sensing activity of bacteria. The relationship among phylogeny, sampling sites and yeast quorum quenching activities of the isolates is analyzed. © 2017 British Mycological Society},

High concentrations of metals and the lowest fungal diversity indices were detected in the sediments of the Central Lake, which can be influenced by human activities due to their proximity to research stations to those of the other two lakes, which were far from the Antarctic stations. At least one type of biological activity was demonstrated by 40 fungal extracts.

Our results suggest that an increase of the anthropogenic activities in the region might have affected the microbial diversity and composition. In addition, the fungal diversity in these lakes may be a useful model to study the effect of anthropogenic activities in Antarctica.

  abstract={Penicillium aurantiogriseum (P. aurantiogriseum) is a post-harvest pathogen that causes significant losses in agricultural production during storage. It plays an important role in food and feed spoilage, and it contaminates agricultural products with mycotoxins that are potentially harmful to human and animal health. P. aurantiogriseum is one of the most toxic species in the genus Penicillium, and it is often isolated from foods, vegetables, fruits and permafrost sediments from the Arctic and Antarctic. It has also been isolated from the marine environment. Thus, it is resistant to several types of stress related to nutrients and growing conditions. This study aimed to determine the effect of sucrose on the physiology of P. aurantiogriseum in order to control its growth and toxigenesis. Mycotoxin production was determined by TLC technique. Our results show a close relationship between the physiological state of P. aurantiogriseum and the secretion of mycotoxins under carbon stress conditions. The physiological state of the pathogen reveals a correlation between increased sucrose concentration and the intensity of aging signs. Aging signs begin to disappear at a sucrose concentration of 400 g/l, which allows the normal characteristics of P. aurantiogriseum to reappear. It is suggested that this transformation is meant to avoid the action of sucrose. Terrestric acid production was recorded at the time of appearance of aging signs. Terrestric acid is always maintained, even after returning to a normal physiological state, but its production was diminished. The growth of P. aurantiogriseum can be controlled by modifying the sucrose concentration in growth medium. This allowed us to determine the critical concentration at which the pathogen suffered and thus reached the phase of decline earlier while mycotoxin production was minimal. © 2020, University of Montenegro.

  abstract={Proglacial environments are ideal for studying the development of soils through the changes of rocks exposed by glacier retreat to weathering and microbial processes. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents as well as soil pH and soil elemental compositions are thought to be dominant factors structuring the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the early stages of soil ecosystem formation. However, the functional linkages between C and N contents, soil composition and microbial community structures remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a multivariate analysis of geochemical properties and associated microbial community structures between a moraine and a glaciofluvial outwash in the proglacial area of a High Arctic glacier (Longyearbreen, Svalbard). Our results reveal distinct differences in developmental stages and heterogeneity between the moraine and the glaciofluvial outwash. We observed significant relationships between C and N contents, δ13Corg and δ15N isotopic ratios, weathering and microbial abundance and community structures. We suggest that the observed differences in microbial and geochemical parameters between the moraine and the glaciofluvial outwash are primarily a result of geomorphological variations of the proglacial terrain. © 2018 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Microorganisms are essential constituents of ecosystems. To improve our understanding of how various factors shape microbial diversity and composition in nature it is important to study how microorganisms vary in space and time. Factors shaping microbial communities in ground level air have been surveyed in a limited number of studies, indicating that geographic location, season and local climate influence the microbial communities. However, few have surveyed more than one location, at high latitude or continuously over more than a year. We surveyed the airborne microbial communities over two full consecutive years in Kiruna, in the Arctic boreal zone, and Ljungbyhed, in the Southern nemoral zone of Sweden, by using a unique collection of archived air filters. We mapped both geographic and seasonal differences in bacterial and fungal communities and evaluated environmental factors that may contribute to these differences and found that location, season and weather influence the airborne communities. Location had stronger influence on the bacterial community composition compared to season, while location and season had equal influence on the fungal community composition. However, the airborne bacterial and fungal diversity showed overall the same trend over the seasons, regardless of location, with a peak during the warmer parts of the year, except for the fungal seasonal trend in Ljungbyhed, which fluctuated more within season. Interestingly, the diversity and evenness of the airborne communities were generally lower in Ljungbyhed. In addition, both bacterial and fungal communities varied significantly within and between locations, where orders like Rhizobiales, Rhodospirillales and Agaricales dominated in Kiruna, whereas Bacillales, Clostridiales and Sordariales dominated in Ljungbyhed. These differences are a likely reflection of the landscape surrounding the sampling sites where the landscape in Ljungbyhed is more homogenous and predominantly characterized by artificial and agricultural surroundings. Our results further indicate that local landscape, as well as seasonal variation, shapes microbial communities in air. Copyright 2020 Karlsson et al.},

  abstract={This study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from Antarctic ecosystems and to assess its potential antibacterial activity on Xanthomonas euvesicatoria and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. passiflorae (phytopathogenic bacteria causing diseases in pepper and tomato and passionfruit, respectively). Among the 66 crude intracellular and extracellular extracts obtained from fungi recovered from soil and 79 obtained from marine sediment samples, 25 showed the ability to prevent the growth of X. euvesicatoria in vitro and 28 showed the ability to prevent the growth of X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae in vitro. Intracellular and extracellular extracts from soil fungi inhibited around 97% of X. euvesicatoria and 98% of X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae at 2·1 mg ml−1. The average inhibition rates against X. euvesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae for intracellular and extracellular extracts from marine sediments fungi were around 96 and 97%, respectively, at 3·0 mg ml−1. Extracts containing secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. euvesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae were obtained, containing possible substitutes for the products currently used to control these phytopathogens. Significance and Impact of the Study: Micro-organisms from extreme ecosystems, such as the Antarctic ecosystem, need to survive in harsh conditions with low temperatures, low nutrients and high UV radiation. Micro-organisms adapt to these conditions evolving diverse biochemical and physiological adaptations essential for survival. All this makes these micro-organisms a rich source of novel natural products based on unique chemical scaffolds. Discovering novel bioactive compounds is essential because of the rise in antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms and the emergence of new infections. Fungi from Antarctic environments have been proven to produce bioactive secondary metabolites against various micro-organisms, but few studies have shown activity against Xanthomonas phytopathogens. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

  abstract={Ice-free regions in coastal areas of Victoria Land, Antarctica, are patchily distributed, limited in extent and characterized by a simple vegetation of lichens and mosses, growing only for a short period during the austral summer. These organisms are associated with soil particles and microorganisms (e.g., algae, microfungi and bacteria) to make up biological soil crusts (BSCs), found worldwide in cold and/or arid and semi-arid regions, where plant growth is impaired. Despite BSCs being among the most widespread ecosystems throughout coastal ice-free areas of continental Antarctica, fungal components of these communities have received little focus. Through ITS1 DNA metabarcoding of samples from 17 sites of six different localities from 73 to 77°S, in a distance scale from 29 to 411 km among different sites, we provide insights into the diversity, community composition, and functionality of fungal communities of these peculiar ecosystems, deepening our knowledge on how they are related to different edaphic variables (i.e. chemical properties and texture). Although fungal richness was low (59 ± 27 OTUs per sample), we found numerous previously unsequenced, putatively unknown fungal species representing a great part of the sampled communities. Community composition was spatially auto-correlated and appeared to be driven by site-specific differences in environmental conditions, particularly edaphic factors, such as exchangeable cations and pH. These results are of particular interest, as they give a wide characterization of the parameters determining soil colonization in a such limiting environment, especially in the light of global changes that are expected to deeply modify the conditions of this environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society},

  abstract={Primary succession models focus on aboveground vascular plants. However, the prevalence of mosses and lichens, that is cryptogams, suggests they play a role in soil successions. Here, we explore whether effects of cryptogams on belowground microbes can facilitate progressive shifts in sand dune succession. We linked aboveground vegetation, belowground bacterial and fungal communities, and soil chemical properties in six successional stages in Arctic inland sand dunes: bare sand, grass, moss, lichen, ericoid heath and mountain birch forest. Compared with the bare sand and grass stages, microbial biomass and the proportion of fungi increased in the moss stage, and later stage microbial groups appeared despite the absence of their host plants. Microbial communities of the lichen stage resembled the communities in the vascular plant stages. Bacterial communities correlated better with soil chemical variables than with vegetation and vice versa for fungal communities. The correlation of fungi with vegetation increased with vascular vegetation. Distinct bacterial and fungal patterns of biomass, richness and plant–microbe interactions showed that the aboveground vegetation change structured the bacterial and fungal community differently. The asynchrony of aboveground vs belowground changes suggests that cryptogams can drive succession towards vascular plant dominance through microbially mediated facilitation in eroded Arctic soil. © 2020 The Authors.

  abstract={Different organic compounds have distinct residence times in soil and are degraded by specific taxa of saprotrophic fungi. It hence follows that specific fungal taxa should respire carbon of different ages from these compounds to the atmosphere. Here, we test whether this is the case by radiocarbon (14C) dating CO2 evolved from two gamma radiation-sterilised maritime Antarctic soils inoculated with pure single cultures of four fungi. We show that a member of the Helotiales, which accounted for 41-56% of all fungal sequences in the two soils, respired soil carbon that was aged up to 1,200 years BP and which was 350-400 years older than that respired by the other three taxa. Analyses of the enzyme profile of the Helotialean fungus and the fluxes and δ13C values of CO2 that it evolved suggested that its release of old carbon from soil was associated with efficient cellulose decomposition. Our findings support suggestions that increases in the ages of carbon respired from warmed soils may be caused by changes to the abundances or activities of discrete taxa of microbes, and indicate that the loss of old carbon from soils is driven by specific fungal taxa. © 2018 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Fungi are the most abundant and one of the most diverse components of arctic soil ecosystems, where they are fundamental drivers of plant nutrient acquisition and recycling. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the factors driving the diversity and functionality of fungal communities associated with these ecosystems, especially in the scope of global warming that is particularly affecting Greenland and is leading to shrub expansion, with expected profound changes of soil microbial communities. We used soil DNA metabarcoding to compare taxonomic and functional composition of fungal communities in three habitats [bare ground (BG), biological soil crusts (BSC), and vascular vegetation (VV) coverage] in Western Greenland. Fungal richness increased with the increasing complexity of the coverage, but BGs and BSCs samples showed the highest number of unique OTUs. Differences in both fungal community composition and distribution of functional guilds identified were correlated with edaphic factors (mainly pH and water content), in turn connected with the different type of coverage. These results suggest also possible losses of diversity connected to the expansion of VV and possible interactions among the members of different functional guilds, likely due to the nutrient limitation, with potential effects on elements recycling. © Copyright © 2019 Canini, Zucconi, Pacelli, Selbmann, Onofri and Geml.},

Two fungal isolates from the Spitzbergen soils after the microscopic observations and “the internal transcribed spacer” (ITS) region molecular characterization were identified as Mortierella antarctica (MA DEM7) and Mortierella verticillata (MV DEM32). In order to study the synthesis of indoleacetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA), Mortierella strains were grown on media supplemented with precursor of phytohormones tryptophan at 9, 15◦ C, and 20◦ C for nine days. The highest amount of IAA synthesis was identified in MV DEM32 nine-day-culture at 15◦ C with 1.5 mM of tryptophan. At the same temperature (15◦ C), the significant promoting effect (about 40% root and shoot fresh weight) of this strain on seedlings was observed. However, only MA DEM-7 had the ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase activity with the highest efficiency at 9◦ C and synthesized IAA without tryptophan. Moreover, at the same conditions, the strain was confirmed to possess the strong promoting effect (about 40% root and 24% shoot fresh weight) on seedlings. Both strains synthesized GA in all tested terms and temperatures. The studied Mortierella strains had some important traits that led them to be considered as microbial biofertilizers components, improving plant growth in difficult temperate climates. © 2018 by the authors.

The strains grew at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free media, with lipase and cellulase highly active even at 3°C. These characteristics likely allow this yeast species to grow and survive in extremely cold, oligotrophic environments, such as the fronts of retreating glaciers in the high Arctic.

  abstract={Recent molecular evidence suggests a global distribution of marine fungi; however, the ecological relevance and corresponding biological contributions of fungi to marine ecosystems remains largely unknown. We assessed fungal biomass from the open Arctic Ocean by applying novel biomass conversion factors from cultured isolates to environmental sterol and CARD-FISH data. We found an average of 16.54 nmol m−3 of ergosterol in sea ice and seawater, which corresponds to 1.74 mg C m−3 (444.56 mg C m−2 in seawater). Using Chytridiomycota-specific probes, we observed free-living and particulate-attached cells that averaged 34.07 µg C m−3 in sea ice and seawater (11.66 mg C m−2 in seawater). Summed CARD-FISH and ergosterol values approximate 1.77 mg C m−3 in sea ice and seawater (456.23 mg C m−2 in seawater), which is similar to biomass estimates of other marine taxa generally considered integral to marine food webs and ecosystem processes. Using the GeoChip microarray, we detected evidence for fungal viruses within the Partitiviridae in sediment, as well as fungal genes involved in the degradation of biomass and the assimilation of nitrate. To bridge our observations of fungi on particulate and the detection of degradative genes, we germinated fungal conidia in zooplankton fecal pellets and germinated fungal conidia after 8 months incubation in sterile seawater. Ultimately, these data suggest that fungi could be as important in oceanic ecosystems as they are in freshwater environments. © 2019, International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

  abstract={Antarctic environments are characterized by polar climate, making it difficult for the development of any form of life. The biogeochemical cycles and food web in such restrictive environments may be exclusively formed by microorganisms. Polar mycological studies are recent and there is much to know about the diversity and genetic resources of these microorganisms. In this sense, the molecular taxonomic approach was applied to identify 129 fungal isolates from marine and terrestrial samples collected from the King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctic). Additionally, the production of cold-adapted enzymes by these microorganisms was evaluated. Among the 129 isolates, 69.0% were identified by ITS-sequencing and affiliated into 12 genera. Cadophora, Geomyces, Penicillium, Cosmospora, and Cladosporium were the most abundant genera. Representatives of Cosmospora were isolated only from terrestrial samples, while representatives of the others genera were recovered from marine and terrestrial samples. A total of 29, 19, and 74 isolates were able to produce ligninolytic enzymes, xylanase, and l-asparaginase, respectively. Representatives of Cadophora showed great ability to produce lignin peroxidase (LiP) and laccase at 15.0 °C in liquid medium, while representatives of Penicillium and non-identified fungi were the best producers of xylanase and l-asparaginase at 20.0 °C. The high number of fungi able to produce enzymes at moderate temperature reveals their potential for industrial production and biotechnological applications. The present study broadens the knowledge of fungal diversity associated with the southern polar region. Additionally, data from molecular taxonomy suggest that two filamentous fungi may be considered as potential new species. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={Salinization of soils is one of the main sources of soil degradation worldwide, particularly in arid and semiarid ecosystems. High salinity results in osmotic stress and it can negatively impact plant grow and survival. Some plant species, however, can tolerate salinity by accumulating osmolytes like proline and maintaining low Na+ concentrations inside the cells. Another mechanism of saline stress tolerance is the association with symbiotic microorganism, an alternative that can be used as a biotechnological tool in susceptible crops. From the immense diversity of plant symbionts, those found in extreme environments such as Antarctica seems to be the ones with most potential since they (and their host) evolved in harsh and stressful conditions. We evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a consortium of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPB) and endosymbiotic fungi isolated from an Antarctic plant on saline stress tolerance in different crops. To test this we established 4 treatments: (i) uninoculated plants with no saline stress, (ii) uninoculated plants subjected to saline stress (200 mM NaCl), (iii) plants inoculated with the microorganism consortium with no saline stress, and (iv) inoculated plants subjected to saline stress. First, we assessed the effect of symbiont consortium on survival of four different crops (cayenne, lettuce, onion, and tomato) in order to obtain a more generalized response of this biological interaction. Second, in order to deeply the mechanisms involved in salt tolerance, in lettuce plants we measured the ecophysiological performance (Fv/Fm) and lipid peroxidation to estimate the impact of saline stress on plants. We also measured proline accumulation and NHX1 antiporter gene expression (involved in Na+ detoxification) to search for possible mechanism of stress tolerance. Additionally, root, shoot, and total biomass was also obtained as an indicator of productivity. Overall, plants inoculated with microorganisms from Antarctica increased the fitness related traits in several crops. In fact, three of four crops selected to assess the general response increased its survival under salt conditions compared with those uninoculated plants. On the other hand, saline stress negatively impacted all measured trait, but inoculated plants were significantly less affected. In control osmotic conditions, there were no differences in proline accumulation and lipid peroxidation between inoculation treatments. Interestingly, even in control salinity, Fv/Fm was higher in inoculated plants after 30 and 60 days. Under osmotic stress, Fv/Fm, proline accumulation and NHX1 expression was significantly higher and lipid peroxidation lower in inoculated plants compared to uninoculated individuals. Moreover, inoculated plants exposed to saline stress had a similar final biomass (whole plant) compared to individuals under no stress. We conclude that Antarctic extremophiles can effectively reduce the physiological impact of saline stress in a salt-susceptible crops and also highlight extreme environments such as Antarctica as a key source of microorganism with high biotechnological potential. © 2019 Acuña-Rodríguez, Hansen, Gallardo-Cerda, Atala and Molina-Montenegro.},

  abstract={Pseudotsuga menziesii is one of the most widely planted conifers in the Patagonian Andes of Argentina, having invading characteristics that are broadly reported. We studied the mycorrhizal status of seedlings along six Nothofagaceae + P. menziesii invasion matrices to investigate their role in the invasive process, according to these hypothesis: a) The abundance and richness of EM will be higher in seedlings grown in their own soil; b) In the presence of native EM inoculum, the invasive plant will be associated with generalist mycorrhizae (EM and/or AM), c) AM associations will be more abundant in P. menziesii seedlings grown in Interface or native forest soils, d) Mycorrhizal community differences between treatments will alter host fitness (growth and nutritional parameters). Seedlings from Nothofagus dombeyi, N. antarctica, Lophozonia alpina, L. obliqua and Pseudotsuga menziesii were set up in a soil-bioassay that included soils from non-invaded Nothofagaceae forests, pure P. menziesii plantations, and the interface between both. Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings showed a decreasing, although never null, ectomycorrhizal (EM) colonization pattern from plantations to non-invaded forests, mainly with exotic EM species. Hebeloma mesophaeum and Wilcoxina sp. 1, two EM species with cosmopolitan distribution, were found to be shared by both tree species. Hebeloma hiemale and Wilcoxina sp. 1, common mycorrhizal partners of P. menziesii in Patagonia although not registered from Nothofagaceae forest, were found to be associated with N. antarctica, being the first report for both fungal species. Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings showed the ability to form different arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) colonization types (Paris-, Arum-, Both- and Intermediate-types) depending on the treatments, with significantly higher presence of Intermediate-type in the Interface treatment, where colonization was low. The shared EM species and the presence of different AM colonization types imply enhanced possibilities for invasive P. menziesii seedlings establishment and development. Seedling features and EM colonization rates evidenced that P. menziesii invasion could produce maladaptation (defined as a relative decline in host fitness due to altered mycorrhizal communities from native settings) of mycorrhizal communities, seriously injuring native ecosystem. © 2018},

  abstract={Due to the dependence of soil organisms on plant derived carbon, disturbances in plant cover are thought to be detrimental for the persistence of soil biota. In this work, we studied the disturbance effects of plant removal and soil mixing and the mitigation effects of replanting on soil biota in a low-arctic meadow ecosystem. We set up altogether six replicate blocks, each including three randomized treatment plots, at two distinct fells at Kilpisjärvi, northern Finland. Vegetation was removed in two thirds of the plots: one third was then kept barren (the plant-removal treatment), while the other third was replanted with a local herb Solidago virgaurea. The remaining plots of intact vegetation were used as treatment comparisons. The responses of soil microbes and fauna were examined six years later in the early and late growing season. The biomass of bacteria, non-mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizal fungi (estimated using PLFA markers) were on average 74%, 89% and 84% lower in the plant-removal and 64%, 74% and 71% lower in the Solidago replant plots than in the intact meadow. The positive effect of replanting was statistically significant for fungi, but not for bacteria. The PCA of relative PLFA concentrations further showed that the structure of the microbial community differed significantly among all three treatments. The abundance of nematodes and collembolans was on average 82 and 95% lower, but the total number of nematode genera and collembolan taxa only 27 and 7% lower in the plant-removal plots than in the intact meadow soil. Few disturbance effects on soil fauna were significantly mitigated by the Solidago replant (the plant parasitic nematodes being a notable exception) and in the case of the collembolans, the Solidago replant plots had even fewer animals than the plant-removal plots. The response of soil biota also varied with locality: the effects on fungivorous nematodes were found at one site only and the replant effects on the number and diversity of collembolan taxa varied with site. Our results suggest that despite drastic reductions in the abundance of soil biota, the majority of animal taxa can persist for years in disturbed arctic soils in the absence of vegetation. In contrast, the alleviating replant effects on the abundance of soil biota appear weak and may only partially reverse the negative effects of vegetation removal and soil disturbance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Many species common for soil were observed at the samples taken at streets and abandoned buildings. Most of them are also known as inhabitants of building materials.

To characterize better the effect of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations on bacterial, archaeal and microeukaryotic communities in low (LC) and high (HC) hydrocarbon-contaminated soil samples from the Maritime Antarctic clone libraries (small-subunit rRNA genes) were constructed. The results showed that a high concentration of hydrocarbons resulted in a decrease in bacterial and eukaryotic diversity; however, no effect of the TPH concentration was observed for the archaeal community. The HC soil samples demonstrated a high relative abundance of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with unclassified group TM7 and eukaryotic OTUs affiliated with unclassified fungi from Pezizomycotina subphyla. Chemical analyses of the LC and HC soil samples revealed the presence of negligible amounts of nitrogen, thereby justifying the use of biostimulation to remediate these Antarctic soils. Microcosm experiments showed that the application of fertilizers led to an increase of up to 27.8% in the TPH degradation values.

  abstract={Arctic tundra regions have been responding to global warming with visible changes in plant community composition, including expansion of shrubs and declines in lichens and bryophytes. Even though it is well known that the majority of arctic plants are associated with their symbiotic fungi, how fungal community composition will be different with climate warming remains largely unknown. In this study, we addressed the effects of long-term (18 years) experimental warming on the community composition and taxonomic richness of soil ascomycetes in dry and moist tundra types. Using deep Ion Torrent sequencing, we quantified how OTU assemblage and richness of different orders of Ascomycota changed in response to summer warming. Experimental warming significantly altered ascomycete communities with stronger responses observed in the moist tundra compared with dry tundra. The proportion of several lichenized and moss-associated fungi decreased with warming, while the proportion of several plant and insect pathogens and saprotrophic species was higher in the warming treatment. The observed alterations in both taxonomic and ecological groups of ascomycetes are discussed in relation to previously reported warming-induced shifts in arctic plant communities, including decline in lichens and bryophytes and increase in coverage and biomass of shrubs. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={In the arctic tundra, N controls the productivity and composition of tundra plant communities. In the Alaskan tundra, microbes only ever appear to be N-limited in Eriophorum vaginatum-dominated tussock tundra, and that only during the summer growing season; during winter microbes continue to respire but show no evidence of N-limitation. What drives the shifts in microbial N-limitation and how are they developed by the metabolic pathways involved in processing available soil organic compounds? To answer these questions, we collected soils from tussock and shrub tundra during four seasons and incubated them with 13C-labeled glucose, glutamate, and protein; then we measured 13C in CO2, microbial biomass, and specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). By analyzing 13C-PLFAs, we were able to assess whether different groups of microbes processed the substrates differently, and to assess changes in N-use brought on by the Arctic winter. Monomers were metabolized during both seasons. In tussock tundra, glutamate-C was assimilated into PLFAs more extensively in winter than summer, suggesting glutamate was used as a C-source during winter but as a N-source during summer. In shrub soils, the flow of C from glutamate to PLFAs tracked with glucose year-round suggesting that the communities were primarily using glutamate as a C source. These results parallel biogeochemical evidence showing shifts in N availability and limitation. Protein metabolism was negligible in winter in soils other than tussocks. In summer, protein was broken down and all communities incorporated C; however, fungi did not assimilate protein-C at all while Gram-positive bacteria appeared to be proteolytic specialists. The different patterns of metabolism of C vs. N containing compounds across microbial groups regulate the dynamics of both soil communities and of soil carbon and nitrogen in tundra soils. As such, the flow of 13C into different biomarker PLFAs provided a lens to evaluate the shifting dynamics of microbial communities and of the resource environment in which they find themselves. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={A major challenge in aquaculture is finding nutrient resources that do not compete with human demand and do not threaten ecological sustainability. Single cell proteins, such as filamentous fungi and yeasts, have similar nutrient profiles to fish meal, grow fast under optimal conditions and contain high amounts of protein, making them attractive candidates as alternative nutrient sources for farmed fish. Moreover, the cell walls of yeasts and filamentous fungi have bioactive properties, potentially mediated via the intestinal microbiota, that positively affect the intestinal health of fish. The microbiota in fish is not well explored and it is uncertain how different dietary components influence its composition. Five experimental diets were fed to Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) to investigate their effects on gut microbiota. The fish meal in a reference diet was replaced with either intact or extracted yeast cells of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the filamentous fungi Rhizopus oryzae or meal from blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). The microbiota was characterised in samples collected from the proximal and distal intestine using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with Illumina MiSeq. Sequence data showed that the gut microbiota was dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which represented 85% of total community abundance, with lactic acid bacteria representing 36.2%. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the data revealed that the microbiota in proximal and distal regions of the intestine had similar composition and that replacement of fish meal with yeast and filamentous fungi affected microbiota composition, primarily with higher relative proportions of Photobacterium and Lactobacillus. Lactic acid bacteria were a dominant fraction of the intestinal microbiota in Arctic charr. Microbial based feeds were associated with similar changes in microbiota composition, but contrasting to the fish-meal based reference diet. Microbiota composition was similar in the proximal and distal gut, but dietary responses were specific to gut segment. © 2016 The Authors},

  abstract={The pool of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Arctic is disproportionally large compared to those in other biomes. This large quantity of SOC accumulated over millennia due to slow rates of decomposition relative to net primary productivity. Decomposition is constrained by low temperatures and nutrient concentrations, which limit soil microbial activity. We investigated how nutrients limit bacterial and fungal biomass and community composition in organic and mineral soils within moist acidic tussock tundra ecosystems. We sampled two experimental arrays of moist acidic tussock tundra that included fertilized and non-fertilized control plots. One array included plots that had been fertilized annually since 1989 and the other since 2006. Fertilization significantly altered overall bacterial community composition and reduced evenness, to a greater degree in organic than mineral soils, and in the 1989 compared to the 2006 site. The relative abundance of copiotrophic α-proteobacteria and β-proteobacteria was higher in fertilized than control soils, and oligotrophic Acidobacteria were less abundant in fertilized than control soils at the 1989 site. Fungal community composition was less sensitive to increased nutrient availability, and fungal responses to fertilization were not consistent between soil horizons and sites. We detected two ectomycorrhizal genera, Russula and Cortinarius spp., associated with shrubs. Their relative abundance was not affected by fertilization despite increased dominance of their host plants in the fertilized plots. Our results indicate that fertilization, which has been commonly used to simulate warming in Arctic tundra, has limited applicability for investigating fungal dynamics under warming. © 2014 Koyama, Wallenstein, Simpson and Moore.},

  abstract={Climate warming at high northern latitudes has caused substantial increases in plant productivity of tundra vegetation and an expansion of the range of deciduous shrub species. However significant the increase in carbon (C) contained within above-ground shrub biomass, it is modest in comparison with the amount of C stored in the soil in tundra ecosystems. Here, we use a 'space-for-time' approach to test the hypothesis that a shift from lower-productivity tundra heath to higher-productivity deciduous shrub vegetation in the sub-Arctic may lead to a loss of soil C that out-weighs the increase in above-ground shrub biomass. We further hypothesize that a shift from ericoid to ectomycorrhizal systems coincident with this vegetation change provides a mechanism for the loss of soil C. We sampled soil C stocks, soil surface CO2 flux rates and fungal growth rates along replicated natural transitions from birch forest (Betula pubescens), through deciduous shrub tundra (Betula nana) to tundra heaths (Empetrum nigrum) near Abisko, Swedish Lapland. We demonstrate that organic horizon soil organic C (SOCorg) is significantly lower at shrub (2.98 ± 0.48 kg m-2) and forest (2.04 ± 0.25 kg m-2) plots than at heath plots (7.03 ± 0.79 kg m-2). Shrub vegetation had the highest respiration rates, suggesting that despite higher rates of C assimilation, C turnover was also very high and less C is sequestered in the ecosystem. Growth rates of fungal hyphae increased across the transition from heath to shrub, suggesting that the action of ectomycorrhizal symbionts in the scavenging of organically bound nutrients is an important pathway by which soil C is made available to microbial degradation. The expansion of deciduous shrubs onto potentially vulnerable arctic soils with large stores of C could therefore represent a significant positive feedback to the climate system. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Two different concentrations (0.066% and 6.6%) of Ag NPs and Ag MPs were tested in microcosms that were exposed to temperatures mimicking a winter to summer transition. Toxicity was monitored by differential respiration, phospholipid fatty acid analysis, polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. Notwithstanding the effect of Ag MPs, nanosilver had an obvious, additional impact on the microbial community, underscoring the importance of particle size in toxicity. This impact was evidenced by levels of differential respiration in 0.066% Ag NP-treated soil that were only half that of control soils, a decrease in signature bacterial fatty acids, and changes in both richness and evenness in bacterial and fungal DNA sequence assemblages. Prominent after Ag NP-treatment were Hypocreales fungi, which increased to 70%, from only 1% of fungal sequences under control conditions. Genera within this Order known for their antioxidant properties (Cordyceps/Isaria ) dominated the fungal assemblage after NP addition. In contrast, sequences attributed to the nitrogen-fixing Rhizobiales bacteria appeared vulnerable to Ag NPmediated toxicity. This combination of physiological, biochemical and molecular studies clearly demonstrate that Ag NPs can severely disrupt the natural seasonal progression of tundra assemblages. © 2014 Kumar et al.},

  abstract={Urnula sp. was isolated as an endophyte of Dicksonia antarctica and identified primarily on the basis of its ITS sequence and morphological features. The anamorphic state of the fungus appeared as a hyphomyceteous-like fungus as based on its features in culture and scanning electron microscopy examination of its spores. On potato dextrose agar (PDA), the organism makes a characteristic fragrance resembling peach pie with vanilla overtones. A GC/MS analysis done on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of this organism, trapped by carbotrap methodology, revealed over 150 compounds with high MS matching quality being noted for 44 of these. Some of the most abundantly produced compounds included 4-decene, tridecane, 2-decene (E), 2-dodecene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, butanoic acid, pentyl ester, and 1-hexanol,2-ethyl. In addition, vanillin, methyl vanillin, and many other fragrant substances were noted including isomenthol, pyrazine derivatives, and 3-decanone. In split plate bioassay tests on potato dextrose agar (PDA), Botrytis cinerea, Ceratocystis ulmi, Pythium ultimum, Fusarium solani, and Rhizoctonia solani were inhibited at levels of 24 to 50% of their normal growth on this medium. Bioreactors supporting fungal growth on 50 g of beet pulp waste, using stainless steel carbotraps, yielded over 180 mg of hydrocarbon-based products collected over 6 weeks of incubation. Similarly, because this organism is making one of the largest sets of VOCs as any fungus examined to date, producing many compounds of commercial interest, it has enormous biotechnical potential. The role of the VOCs in the biology and ecology of this endophyte may be related to the antimicrobial activities that they possess. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract={Climate warming leads to more intensive evaporation from the Arctic sea resulting in increased precipitation in the low Arctic, e.g., higher snowfall during winter. Deeper snow keeps the arctic soils warmer and alters soil attributes and vegetation, e.g., increase in nitrogen availability, expansion of shrubs and decline in shade-intolerant lichens and bryophytes. Changes in soil properties and vegetation are expected to influence on saprotrophic and plant-symbiotic fungi, but how increased snow depth affects their community composition remain unknown. In the present work, we used DNA metabarcoding to study the effects of long-term experimental manipulations of snow depth on soil fungal communities in dry heath and moist tussock tundra in Arctic Alaska. We report strong changes in fungal community compositions in the two tundra types, with pronounced declines observed in the majority of fungal functional guilds, including ectomycorrhizal, lichenized, plant pathogenic, saprotrophic and bryophyte-associated species. The observed changes in lichenized and bryophyte-associated fungi are in agreement with previously published above-ground changes, i.e. decrease of lichen and bryophyte cover and diversity. However, the majority of observed trends, including the decline of ectomycorrhizal fungi (that were anticipated to benefit from the expansion of their host plants), suggest that changes in fungal communities do not entirely correspond to and are not primarily driven by shifts in vegetation. Instead, arctic fungal communities appear to exhibit faster turnover that may be influenced by dynamic interactions with numerous biotic and abiotic factors, e.g., soil nutrient cycling and community dynamics in other groups of soil microorganisms. We highlight the importance of “below-ground studies” in assessing ecosystem responses to climatic changes, because faster turnover of microbial communities may be applicable for monitoring early-stage alterations caused by climatic changes. © 2016 The Authors},

  abstract={Background: The glucuronoyl esterase enzymes of wood-degrading fungi (Carbohydrate Esterase family 15; CE15) form part of the hemicellulolytic and cellulolytic enzyme systems that break down plant biomass, and have possible applications in biotechnology. Homologous enzymes are predicted in the genomes of several bacteria, however these have been much less studied than their fungal counterparts. Here we describe the recombinant production and biochemical characterization of a bacterial CE15 enzyme denoted MZ0003, which was identified by in silico screening of a prokaryotic metagenome library derived from marine Arctic sediment. MZ0003 has high similarity to several uncharacterized gene products of polysaccharide-degrading bacterial species, and phylogenetic analysis indicates a deep evolutionary split between these CE15s and fungal homologs. Results: MZ0003 appears to differ from previously-studied CE15s in some aspects. Some glucuronoyl esterase activity could be measured by qualitative thin-layer chromatography which confirms its assignment as a CE15, however MZ0003 can also hydrolyze a range of other esters, including p-nitrophenyl acetate, which is not acted upon by some fungal homologs. The structure of MZ0003 also appears to differ as it is predicted to have several large loop regions that are absent in previously studied CE15s, and a combination of homology-based modelling and site-directed mutagenesis indicate its catalytic residues deviate from the conserved Ser-His-Glu triad of many fungal CE15s. Taken together, these results indicate that potentially unexplored diversity exists among bacterial CE15s, and this may be accessed by investigation of the microbial metagenome. The combination of low activity on typical glucuronoyl esterase substrates, and the lack of glucuronic acid esters in the marine environment suggest that the physiological substrate of MZ0003 and its homologs is likely to be different from that of related fungal enzymes. © 2016 De Santi et al.

Furthermore, its biodegradation ability towards 13 different toxic compounds such as 4-butylphenol (4-BP), 4-sec-butylphenol (4-s-BP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), phenol, bisphenol A (BPA), benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene at low (4°C) and medium (15°C) temperature conditions was evaluated using high pressure liquid chromatography. Among the 13 compounds, the strain CHY-2 effectively degraded the six compounds i.e., 4-BP, 4-s-BP, 4-t-BP, 4-NP, 4-CP, and phenol at 15°C within one week, and at 4°C within 3 weeks. Also CHY-2 effectively degraded the 4-t-OP at 15°C (70%), but not at 4°C (35%). Among different carbon sources tested, glucose was found to be the most suitable and the growth of CHY-2 at 4°C was slower than at 15°C. Addition of Tween 80 increased the growth and degradation ability of CHY-2 towards 4-BP at 4 and 15°C. The metabolites produced during the degradation of 4-BP were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Also, bacteria present in the Antarctic soil were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the result showed the presence of Pseudomonas and Syntrophus groups of bacteria. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  abstract={High amounts of driftwood sail across the oceans and provide habitat for organisms tolerating the rough and saline environment. Fungi have adapted to the extremely cold and saline conditions which driftwood faces in the high north. For the first time, we applied high-throughput sequencing to fungi residing in driftwood to reveal their taxonomic richness, community composition, and ecology in the North Atlantic. Using pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons obtained from 49 marine logs, we found 807 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustering at 97 % sequence similarity cut-off level. The phylum Ascomycota comprised 74 % of the OTUs and 20 % belonged to Basidiomycota. The richness of basidiomycetes decreased with prolonged submersion in the sea, supporting the general view of ascomycetes being more extremotolerant. However, more than one fourth of the fungal OTUs remained unassigned to any fungal class, emphasising the need for better DNA reference data from the marine habitat. Different fungal communities were detected in coniferous and deciduous logs. Our results highlight that driftwood hosts a considerably higher fungal diversity than currently known. The driftwood fungal community is not a terrestrial relic but a speciose assemblage of fungi adapted to the stressful marine environment and different kinds of wooden substrates found in it. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract={A significant fraction of carbon stored in the Earth's soil moves through arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and ectomycorrhiza (EM). The impacts of AM and EM on the soil carbon budget are poorly understood. We propose a method to quantify the mycorrhizal contribution to carbon cycling, explicitly accounting for the abundance of plant-associated and extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium. We discuss the need to acquire additional data to use our method, and present our new global database holding information on plant species-by-site intensity of root colonization by mycorrhizas. We demonstrate that the degree of mycorrhizal fungal colonization has globally consistent patterns across plant species. This suggests that the level of plant species-specific root colonization can be used as a plant trait. To exemplify our method, we assessed the differential impacts of AM : EM ratio and EM shrub encroachment on carbon stocks in sub-arctic tundra. AM and EM affect tundra carbon stocks at different magnitudes, and via partly distinct dominant pathways: via extraradical mycelium (both EM and AM) and via mycorrhizal impacts on above- and belowground biomass carbon (mostly AM). Our method provides a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment of mycorrhizal impact on local and global carbon cycling processes, paving the way towards an improved understanding of the role of mycorrhizas in the Earth's carbon cycle. © 2015 New Phytologist Trust.},

  abstract={The Polish Arctowski Station is situated in the maritime Antarctic on the western shore of Admiralty Bay and encompasses terrestrial habitats which are not permanently covered by ice, in contrast to more than 90% of the island’s surface area. Over the past several decades, studies exploring the soils of those habitats have revealed a considerable diversity of bacteria, filamentous fungi, and, to a lesser extent, yeasts; however, characterization of this complex microbiome, especially at the molecular level, is still far from satisfactory. The isolates were assigned to their respective genera and species based on genetic analysis of the D1/D2 and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions of rDNA. In the studied soil samples, the most abundant microorganisms belonged to the genera Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, and Debaryomyces. Physiological and biochemical analysis of Cryptococcus gilvescens (pro tempore Goffeauzyma gilvescens) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa showed only a limited level of intraspecies diversity. Cellular DNA content and karyotypes were determined using flow cytometry and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for several selected strains. For the first time, genome size and electrophoretic karyotypes were investigated in C. gilvescens (pro tem G. gilvescens), Cryptococcus saitoi (pro tem Naganishia globosa), Cryptococcus gastricus (pro tem Goffeauzyma gastrica), and Cryptococcus albidus (pro tem Naganishia albida). In addition, plate tests showed Antarctic yeasts to be a potential source of biotechnologically important enzymes. This study in biodiversity, presenting physiological and molecular characterization of psychrotolerant yeast strains isolated from the soils of western Admiralty Bay, contributes to a better understanding of the microbial ecology of this unique ecosystem. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={Viable bacterial cells and its genetic material can be stably maintained in Arctic permafrost for a long geological time. Because of the seasonal melting of permafrost strata, it cannot be excluded an access to the surface of ancient highly invasive species with increased pathogenicity. Mycoplasmas are very successful pathogens in humans, mammals, birds, insects, and plants, with high genome plasticity and ability to avoid immune response of host organism. The metagenomic approach allowed us to predict mycoplasma diversity in the Arctic permafrost. The number of mycoplasma DNA fragments in soil deposits of comparable age (∼30,000 years) and origin (the late Pleistocene Ice Complexes) is not so abundant compared with other microorganisms, but it is enough for a chance in the presence of living mycoplasmal cells in permafrost. DNA fragments of human, animal, insect, and plant pathogens were identified. The “ubiquitous” mycoplasma Acholeplasma laidlawii is the undisputed leader in the number of identified sequences in all three metagenomes. It may indicate a higher adaptive capacity and more powerful metabolic potential of A. laidlawii among Mollicutes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Entering the Arctic Ocean via large boreal river systems and being transported by currents and sea ice, driftwood is finally deposited along shallow coastlines. Here, we sequence 177 fungal cultures in driftwood from Iceland, Greenland and the Siberian Lena Delta. Although some fungi may survive during ice drift, most species are not shared among the different sampling sites. Many indigenous Arctic fungi are generalists in their ability to colonize and decompose organic substrata, with massive effects on carbon cycling. Cadophora species are the most frequent Ascomycota, and soft rot is the most prevalent form of decay. Few Basidiomycota were found, with many of them having poor sequence matches to known species.

In the Arctic, the prevalent harsh cold conditions experienced by both host plants and fungi may have selected for AMF species with long-surviving spores, the principal means for dispersal and survival. However, basic knowledge about their viability is lacking. AMF spore assembly from two Arctic sites was examined in soil samples collected across an 11-year period and stored at −20 °C for up to 10 years. AMF spore viability and ability to colonize plants were investigated in the greenhouse using Plantago lanceolata. It was predicted that Arctic AMF spores would survive in cold conditions for several years, with an expected decrease in viability over time as suggested by other experiments with temperate material. Results show that even though the two study sites differed in AMF spore density, the relative abundance of spore morphotypes was rather similar across sites and years. Furthermore, spore viability over time was site-dependent as it decreased only in one site. Although spores were viable, only a very small proportion of hosts and roots became colonized in the greenhouse even 21 months after inoculation. Taken together, these results suggest a certain site-dependent variability in AMF spore communities and the ability of Arctic AMF spores to remain viable after a long-term storage in cold conditions. The lack of host colonization in the greenhouse may be related to the inability to overcome spore dormancy under these conditions. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi usually improve plant performance yet our knowledge about their effects on seed germination and early plant establishment is very limited. We performed a factorial greenhouse experiment where the seeds from four low Arctic co-occurring mycorrhizal herbs (Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Sibbaldia procumbens, and Solidago virgaurea) were germinated alone or in the vicinity of an adult Sibbaldia plant with or without AM fungi; given either as spores or being present in a common mycorrhizal network (CMN). Three different AM fungal species were examined to assess species-specific differences in symbiont acquisition rate. Of the four plant species investigated, the presence of AM fungi affected seed germination only in Campanula and this effect was dependent on whether the AM fungi were present in the soil as spores or as a CMN. Overall, after germination, developing seedlings showed AM fungal colonization in their roots as soon as 2 d after cotyledon emergence. Our results show that CMN may provide germinating seedlings faster acquisition of the AM fungal partner in comparison to acquisition from spores. Furthermore, there were AM species-specific differences in the symbiont acquisition rate highlighting the importance of species identity in AM interactions. These findings suggest that while AM fungi may not play a fundamental role during seed germination, plant community composition may be affected by the species-specific AM fungal effects on seedling establishment and CMN acquisition. © 2016 Varga and Kytöviita.},

In this work, the ability to utilize phenol, methanol and n-hexadecane as C source, the tolerance to different heavy metals and growth from 5 to 30 °C were evaluated in cold-adapted yeasts isolated from Antarctica. Fifty-nine percent of the yeasts were classified as psychrotolerant as they could grow in all the range of temperature tested, while the other 41% were classified as psychrophilic as they only grew below 25 °C. In the assimilation tests, 32, 78, and 13% of the yeasts could utilize phenol, n-hexadecane, and methanol as C source, respectively, but only 6% could assimilate the three C sources evaluated. In relation to heavy metals ions, 55, 68, and 80% were tolerant to 1 mM of Cr(VI), Cd(II), and Cu(II), respectively. Approximately a half of the isolates tolerated all of them. Most of the selected yeasts belong to genera previously reported as common for Antarctic soils, but several other genera were also isolated, which contribute to the knowledge of this cold environment mycodiversity. The tolerance to heavy metals of the phenol-degrading cold-adapted yeasts illustrated that the strains could be valuable as inoculant for cold wastewater treatment in extremely cold environments. © 2017, Springer Japan.},

  abstract={We assessed the diversity and distribution of fungi in 13 water samples collected from four aquatic environments (stream, pond, melting ice water, and estuary) in the Ny-Ålesund Region, Svalbard (High Arctic) using 454 pyrosequencing with fungi-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene. Aquatic fungal communities in this region showed high diversity, with a total of 43,061 reads belonging to 641 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being found. Of these OTUs, 200 belonged to Ascomycota, 196 to Chytridiomycota, 120 to Basidiomycota, 13 to Glomeromycota, and 10 to early diverging fungal lineages (traditional Zygomycota), whereas 102 belonged to unknown fungi. The major orders were Helotiales, Eurotiales, and Pleosporales in Ascomycota; Chytridiales and Rhizophydiales in Chytridiomycota; and Leucosporidiales and Sporidiobolales in Basidiomycota. The common fungal genera Penicillium, Rhodotorula, Epicoccum, Glaciozyma, Holtermanniella, Betamyces, and Phoma were identified. Interestingly, the four aquatic environments in this region harbored different aquatic fungal communities. Salinity, conductivity, and temperature were important factors in determining the aquatic fungal diversity and community composition. The results suggest the presence of diverse fungal communities and a considerable number of potentially novel fungal species in Arctic aquatic environments, which can provide reliable data for studying the ecological and evolutionary responses of fungi to climate change in the Arctic ecosystem. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract={Hydrocarbon catabolic genes were investigated in soils and sediments in nine different locations around Syowa Station, Antarctica, using conventional PCR, real-time PCR, cloning, and sequencing analysis. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD)-coding genes from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were observed. Clone libraries of Gram-positive RHD genes were related to (i) nidA3 of Mycobacterium sp. py146, (ii) pdoA of Terrabacter sp. HH4, (iii) nidA of Diaphorobacter sp. KOTLB, and (iv) pdoA2 of Mycobacterium sp. CH-2, with 95–99 % similarity. Clone libraries of Gram-negative RHD genes were related to the following: (i) naphthalene dioxygenase of Burkholderia glathei, (ii) phnAc of Burkholderia sartisoli, and (iii) RHD alpha subunit of uncultured bacterium, with 41–46 % similarity. Interestingly, the diversity of the Gram-positive RHD genes found around this area was higher than those of the Gram-negative RHD genes. Real-time PCR showed different abundance of dioxygenase genes between locations. Moreover, the PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profile demonstrated diverse bacterial populations, according to their location. Forty dominant fragments in the DGGE profiles were excised and sequenced. All of the sequences belonged to ten bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Cyanobacteria, Chlorobium, and Acidobacteria. In addition, the bacterial genus Sphingomonas, which has been suggested to be one of the major PAH degraders in the environment, was observed in some locations. The results demonstrated that indigenous bacteria have the potential ability to degrade PAHs and provided information to support the conclusion that bioremediation processes can occur in the Antarctic soils and sediments studied here. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={During the late nineteenth century, Europeans introduced rabbits to many of the sub-Antarctic islands, environments that prior to this had been devoid of mammalian herbivores. The impacts of rabbits on indigenous ecosystems are well studied; notably, they cause dramatic changes in plant communities and promote soil erosion. However, the responses of fungal communities to such biotic disturbances remain unexplored. We used metabarcoding of soil extracellular DNA to assess the diversity of plant and fungal communities at sites on the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islandswith contrasting histories of disturbance by rabbits. Our results suggest that on these islands, the simplification of plant communities and increased erosion resulting from the introduction of rabbits have driven compositional changes, including diversity reductions, in indigenous soil fungal communities. Moreover, there is no indication of recovery at sites from which rabbits were removed 20 years ago. These results imply that introduced herbivores have long-lasting and multifaceted effects on fungal biodiversity as well as highlight the low resiliency of sub-Antarctic ecosystems. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract={The Antarctic Dry Valleys are unable to support higher plant and animal life and so microbial communities dominate biotic ecosystem processes. Soil communities are well characterized, but rocky surfaces have also emerged as a significant microbial habitat. Here, we identify extensive colonization of weathered granite on a landscape scale by chasmoendolithic microbial communities. A transect across north-facing and south-facing slopes plus valley floor moraines revealed 30-100 % of available substrate was colonized up to an altitude of 800 m. Communities were assessed at a multidomain level and were clearly distinct from those in surrounding soils and other rock-inhabiting cryptoendolithic and hypolithic communities. All colonized rocks were dominated by the cyanobacterial genus Leptolyngbya (Oscillatoriales), with heterotrophic bacteria, archaea, algae, and fungi also identified. Striking patterns in community distribution were evident with regard to microclimate as determined by aspect. Notably, a shift in cyanobacterial assemblages from Chroococcidiopsis-like phylotypes (Pleurocapsales) on colder-drier slopes, to Synechococcus-like phylotypes (Chroococcales) on warmer-wetter slopes. Greater relative abundance of known desiccation-tolerant bacterial taxa occurred on colder-drier slopes. Archaeal phylotypes indicated halotolerant taxa and also taxa possibly derived from nearby volcanic sources. Among the eukaryotes, the lichen photobiont Trebouxia (Chlorophyta) was ubiquitous, but known lichen-forming fungi were not recovered. Instead, fungal assemblages were dominated by ascomycetous yeasts. We conclude that chasmoendoliths likely constitute a significant geobiological phenomenon at lower elevations in granite-dominated Antarctic Dry Valley systems. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract={Mitchell Peninsula is located towards the East of the Windmill Islands in eastern Antarctica. It is an ice-free polar desert, and knowledge of its soil microbial taxonomic composition is limited. In this study, we investigated the soil microbial taxonomic composition using multiplex 454 pyrosequencing targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA and the fungal ITS genes; and the bacterial and fungal abundances were estimated using quantitative PCR. In total, 40 bacterial and five fungal phyla were identified comprising 111 bacterial and 22 fungal classes, respectively. Mitchell Peninsula soil exhibited a unique bacterial taxonomic profile. In contrast to the usual dominance of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in polar and temperate soils, Mitchell Peninsula was rich in the poorly studied Chloroflexi (31.7 %), candidate divisions WPS-2 (8.1 %) and AD3 (5.1 %), while the commonly observed Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were present in relative abundances below 1 %. The fungal community consisted of Ascomycota (77 %) and Basidiomycota (10 %), and was dominated by the lichenous fungal class Lecanoromycetes (46.4 %). Network analysis revealed the presence of several microbial clusters that each potentially occupied a different environmental niche, and fewer numbers of correlations were identified between bacteria within each cluster compared with the lichen community, where extensive community dynamics may be present. As Mitchell Peninsula exhibits a unique microbial taxonomic composition, not previously observed in any reported polar or temperate ecosystem, we believe it is a potential microbial biodiversity “hotspot”, which warrants further investigation to examine the role of the dominance of these uncharacterised candidate divisions in this extreme ecosystem. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={Trichoderma species have the potential for application in composting as biological control agents in controlling disease and increasing yield of production in the agricultural industry. The prevalent soil fungus of Trichoderma produces lignocellulolytic enzymes that assist the degradation of woody lignocellulose materials. The aim of the experimental work was to check the potential of lignocellulolytic Trichoderma fungi for the use of rapid composting of oil palm empty fruit bunches fibers. Fifty-two of Trichoderma isolates from Sabah and seven isolates from Antarctic were examined for in-vitro lignocellulolytic activity by assaying their ability to develop dark brown pigments, yellow halo zone, and clear white zone on tannic acid media (TAM) for lignin; Jensen Media (JM) for cellulose; and modified Melin-Nokrans media (MMNM) for starch. The best six Sabah Trichoderma isolates (5D, 10L2, 10P, 5E, 10X, and 10E2) were found to be potential lignocellulolytic agents based on their diameter of halo zone formed on amended media for further testing of in vitro bioconversion of oil palm empty fruit bunches. The diameters of halo zones were measured for the analysis of their ability in degrading lignin, cellulose, and starch. In contrast, Antarctic Trichoderma isolates consistently exhibited lower lignocellulolytic activities based on their smaller diameter of halo zone formed on TAM, JM, and MMNM. Most of the Trichoderma isolates are found to synthesize polyphenol oxidase, endoglucanases, and are able to hydrolyze starch to glucose in the three different media. Thus, the finding shows the potential of these isolates for use in large-scale composting of oil palm empty fruit bunches. © 2014 Saili NS, et al.},

  abstract={Since the discovery of penicillin, fungi have been an important source of bioactive natural products. However, as a specific resource, the bioactive potentiality and specificity of fungal metabolites from the Antarctic region have had little attention. In this paper, we investigated the diversity patterns and biological activities of cultivable fungi isolated from soil samples in Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. Fungal communities showed low abundance and diversity; a total of 150 cultivable fungi were isolated from eight soil samples. After being dereplicated by morphological characteristics and chemical fingerprints, 47 fungal isolates were identified by ITS-rDNA sequencing. We confirmed that these isolates belonged to at least 11 different genera and clustered into nine groups corresponding to taxonomic orders in the phylogenetic analysis. Using two different fermentation conditions, 94 crude extracts acquired from the abovementioned different metabolite characteristic isolates were screened by bioactivity assay and 18 isolates produced biologically active compounds. Compared with HPLC–DAD–UV fingerprint analysis of culture extracts and standard compounds, two bioactive components secalonic acid and chetracins were identified. Our research suggests that the abundance and diversity of Antarctic cultivable fungal communities exhibit unique ecological characteristics and potential producers of novel natural bioactive products. © 2016, Springer Japan.},

  abstract={Thawing of permafrost soils is expected to stimulate microbial decomposition and respiration of sequestered carbon. This could, in turn, increase atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide and methane, and create a positive feedback to climate warming. Recent metagenomic studies suggest that permafrost has a large metabolic potential for carbon processing, including pathways for fermentation and methanogenesis. Here, we performed a pilot study using ultrahigh throughput Illumina HiSeq sequencing of reverse transcribed messenger RNA to obtain a detailed overview of active metabolic pathways and responsible organisms in up to 70 cm deep permafrost soils at a moist acidic tundra location in Arctic Alaska. The transcriptional response of the permafrost microbial community was compared before and after 11 days of thaw. In general, the transcriptional profile under frozen conditions suggests a dominance of stress responses, survival strategies, and maintenance processes, whereas upon thaw a rapid enzymatic response to decomposing soil organic matter (SOM) was observed. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, ascomycete fungi, and methanogens were responsible for largest transcriptional response upon thaw. Transcripts indicative of heterotrophic methanogenic pathways utilizing acetate, methanol, and methylamine were found predominantly in the permafrost table after thaw. Furthermore, transcripts involved in acetogenesis were expressed exclusively after thaw suggesting that acetogenic bacteria are a potential source of acetate for acetoclastic methanogenesis in freshly thawed permafrost. Metatranscriptomics is shown here to be a useful approach for inferring the activity of permafrost microbes that has potential to improve our understanding of permafrost SOM bioavailability and biogeochemical mechanisms contributing to greenhouse gas emissions as a result of permafrost thaw. © 2015 Coolen and Orsi.},

  abstract={Lichens as symbiotic associations consisting of a fungus (the mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont) dominate the terrestrial vegetation of continental Antarctica. The photobiont provides carbon nutrition for the fungus. Therefore, performance and protection of photosystem II is a key factor of lichen survival. Potentials and limitations of photobiont physiology require intense investigation to extend the knowledge on adaptation mechanisms in the lichen symbiosis and to clarify to which extent photobionts benefit from symbiosis. Isolated photobionts and entire lichen thalli have been examined. The contribution of the photobiont concerning adaptation mechanisms to the light regime and temperature conditions was examined by chlorophyll a fluorescence and pigment analysis focusing on the foliose lichen Umbilicaria decussata from North Victoria Land, continental Antarctica. No photoinhibition has been observed in the entire lichen thallus. In the isolated photobionts, photoinhibition was clearly temperature dependent. For the first time, melanin in U. decussata thalli has been proved. Though the isolated photobiont is capable of excess light protection, the results clearly show that photoprotection is significantly increased in the symbiotic state. The closely related photobiont of Pleopsidium chlorophanum, a lichen lacking melanin, showed a higher potential of carotenoid-based excess light tolerance. This fact discriminates the two photobionts of the same Trebouxia clade. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the successful adaptation of lichens to continental Antarctic conditions is in part based on the physiological potential of the photobionts. The findings provide information on the success of symbiotic life in extreme environments. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={The aim of this work was to study the potential of the non-lignolytic filamentous fungus Penicillium sp. CHY-2, isolated from Antarctic soil, for the biodegradation of eight different aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as octane, decane, dodecane, ethylbenzene, butylbenzene, naphthalene, acenaphthene, and benzo[a]pyrene. Among all the compounds, CHY-2 showed the highest level of degradation for decane (49.0%), followed by butylbenzene (42.0%) and dodecane (33.0%), and lower levels of degradation for naphthalene (15.0%), acenaphthene (10.0%), octane (8.0%), ethylbenzene (4.0%), and benzo[a]pyrene (2.0%) at 20 °C. The addition of carbon sources such as glucose (5 g L-1) and Tween-80 (5 g L-1) enhanced decane degradation by about 1.8-fold and 1.61-fold respectively at 20 °C. The metabolites produced during the degradation of decane were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore, the enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP) from CHY-2 was purified. MnP was found to consist of monomers with a molecular mass of 36 kDa. The purified MnP had an optimum pH of 5.0 and temperature of 30 °C. The Km and Vmax values of MnP towards Mn2+ were 1.31 μM and 185.19 μM min-1 respectively. These results indicated that the strain CHY-2 can be used for the degradation of hydrocarbons and could have promising applications in treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated sites. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

  abstract={Lipases are key components in the mechanisms underlying the persistence and virulence of infections by fungi, and thus also promising triggers for bioresponsive lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles. We here propose a platform in which only a minor component of the formulation is susceptible to cleavage by lipase and where hydrolysis triggers a controlled phase transition within the nanoparticles that can potentially allow for an extended drug release. The responsive formulations were composed of phytantriol, which was included as a non-cleavable major component and polysorbate 80, which serves both as nanoparticle stabilizer and potential lipase target. To monitor the structural changes resulting from lipase activity with sufficient time resolution, we used synchrotron small angle x-ray scattering. Comparing the effect of the two different lipases used in this work, lipase B from Candida Antarctica, (CALB) and lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (RMML), only CALB induced phase transition from bicontinuous reverse cubic to reverse hexagonal phase within the particles. This phase transition can be attributed to an increasing amount of oleic acid formed on cleavage of the polysorbate 80. However, when also a small amount of a cationic surfactant was included in the formulation, RMML could trigger the corresponding phase transition as well. The difference in activity between the two lipases can tentatively be explained by a difference in their interaction with the nanoparticle surface. Thus, a bioresponsive system for treating fungal infections, with a tunable selectivity for different types of lipases, could be obtained by tuning the composition of the nanoparticle formulation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The soil-plate method, agar block, disc diffusion and broth micro-dilution assays were applied to characterize the thermal classes and antimicrobial activity of the isolated fungi. A total of 27 isolates of fungi were obtained from 14 soil samples, including 13 Ascomycota, 4 Zygomycota and 10 anamorphic fungi. Cold-active (psychrotolerant) fungi predominated over cold-adapted (psychrophilic) fungi. In the antimicrobial assay, 16 isolates showed substantial inhibitory activity against test bacterial pathogens. Ethyl acetate extracts of 10 competent isolates showed significant inhibition of bacterial pathogens. Antifungal activity was observed in the disc diffusion assay, but not in the agar block assay. Minimum inhibitory, bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations were determined using the broth micro-dilution method, with an average in the range of 0.78-25 mg ml-1on the test microorganisms. Isolate WHB-sp. 7 showed the best broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, with the potential for biotechnological studies in antibiotic development.},

  abstract={The so far coldest location for flowering plant life was found at 4,505 m asl at the Dom summit in Valais (Switzerland). On an ice-free crest, Saxifraga oppositifolia, a typical arctic-alpine arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plant forms several cushions. Here, we report on a surprisingly diverse fungal community of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal species at this particular location. A few grams of fine sand and organic material obtained from the rhizospheric lithic ‘soil’ and fine roots of S. oppositifolia were examined for fungal spores and hyphae. We found five different species of AM fungi (Glomeromycota) that belonged to all three glomeromycotan classes, to four orders and five different families. We also found hyphae of dark-septate endophytes (unidentified on the species and genus level, members of Vibrisseaceae, Helotiales, Ascomycota) and a few cleistothecia of a putative fungal leaf pathogen resembling Podosphaera alpina (Erysiphaceae, Erysiphales, Ascomycota), which is known to cause powdery mildew on S. oppositifolia. Given the size of the cushions and their annual growth, these microcosms of life may not be older than 30 years, obviously sufficient time to establish a rich fungal community despite the extreme cold at this location, which in terms of higher level mycorrhizal fungal taxa is obviously comparable with fungal communities of well-established alpine, mountainous and even temperate lowland grasslands. © 2014, Swiss Botanical Society.},

We hypothesize that root-associated fungal (RAF) communities respond to the same fine-scale environmental gradients as the aboveground vegetation, creating a coherent pattern between aboveground vegetation and RAF. We explored how RAF communities of the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) plant Bistorta vivipara and aboveground vegetation structure of arctic plants were affected by biotic and abiotic variables at 0.3-3.0-m scales. RAF communities were determined using pyrosequencing. Composition and spatial structure of RAF and aboveground vegetation in relation to collected biotic and abiotic variables were analysed by ordination and semi-variance analyses. The vegetation was spatially structured along soil C and N gradients, whereas RAF lacked significant spatial structure. A weak relationship between RAF community composition and the cover of two ECM plants, B. vivipara and S. polaris, was found, and RAF richness increased with host root length and root weight. Results suggest that the fine-scale spatial structure of RAF communities of B. vivipara and the aboveground vegetation are driven by different factors. At fine spatial scales, neighbouring ECM plants may affect RAF community composition, whereas soil nutrients gradients structure the vegetation. © 2014 New Phytologist Trust.},

  abstract={We examined patterns in soil microbial community composition across a successional gradient of drained lake basins in the Arctic Coastal Plain. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that methanogens closely related to Candidatus Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis were the dominant archaea, comprising >50% of the total archaea at most sites, with particularly high levels in the oldest basins and in the top 57 cm of soil (active and transition layers). Bacterial community composition was more diverse, with lineages from OP11, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria found in high relative abundance across all sites. Notably, microbial composition appeared to converge in the active layer, but transition and permafrost layer communities across the sites were significantly different to one another. Microbial biomass using fatty acid-based analysis indicated that the youngest basins had increased abundances of gram-positive bacteria and saprotrophic fungi at higher soil organic carbon levels, while the oldest basins displayed an increase in only the gram-positive bacteria. While this study showed differences in microbial populations across the sites relevant to basin age, the dominance of Candidatus M. stordalenmirensis across the chronosequence indicates the potential for changes in local carbon cycling, depending on how these methanogens and associated microbial communities respond to warming temperatures.},

It preserves a remarkable sample of terrestrial life from high-latitude central Gondwana prior to the Capitanian mass extinction event from both mega- and microfossil evidence that includes cryptic components rarely seen in other fossil assemblages. The peat layer is dominated by glossopterid and cordaitalean gymnosperms and contains moderately common herbaceous lycophytes, together with a broad array of dispersed organs of ferns and other gymnosperms. Rare arthropod-plant and fungal-plant interactions are preserved in detail, together with a plethora of fungal morphotypes, Peronosporomycetes, arthropod remains and a diverse coprolite assemblage. Comparisons to other Palaeozoic ecosystems show that the macroflora is of low diversity. The fungal and invertebrate-plant associations demonstrate that a multitude of ecological interactions were well developed by the Middle Permian in high-latitude forest mires that contributed to the dominant coal deposits of the Southern Hemisphere. Quantitative analysis of the constituents of the silicified peat and of macerals within adjacent coal seams reveals that whilst silicified peats provide an unparalleled sample of the organisms forming Permian coals, they do not necessarily reflect the volumetric proportions of constituents within the derived coal.

However, the role and community composition of AM fungi in succession are not well known and the northern latitudes remain poorly investigated ecosystems. We studied AM fungal communities in the roots of the grass Deschampsia flexuosa in two different, closely located, successional stages in a northern Aeolian sand area. The AM fungal taxa richness in planta was estimated by cloning and sequencing small subunit ribosomal RNA genes. AM colonization, shoot δ13C signature, and %N and %C were measured. Soil microbial community structure and AM fungal mycelium abundance were estimated using phospholipid (PLFA) and neutral lipid (NLFA) analyses. The two successional stages were characterized by distinct plant, microbial, and fungal communities. AM fungal species richness was very low in both the early and late successional stages. AM frequency in D. flexuosa roots was higher in the early successional stage than in the late one. The AM fungal taxa retrieved belonged to the genera generally adapted to Arctic or extreme environments. AM fungi seemed to be important in the early stage of the succession, suggesting that AM fungi may help plants to better cope with the harsh environmental conditions, especially in an early successional stage with more extreme environmental fluctuations. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={Premise of research. Abundant peat mosses and epibiotic microbiota, common in widespread modern peatlands, constitute complex biotic systems recognized to provide globally significant ecosystem services: organic carbon sequestration, methane oxidation, and nitrogen fixation. Because recent fossil and molecular diversification evidence indicates that peat mosses are 1450 Myr old, they may be among Earth’s earliest land plants. The biogeochemical effects of early vegetation, which may have occupied remote islands and experienced nutritional stress and episodes of high UV radiation, are poorly understood. To gain insight into taxonomic composition, biogeochemical function, and resilience of archaic peat moss microbiomes, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of a similarly stressed modern peat moss. Methodology. Sphagnum fimbriatum was sampled from Chilean sub-Antarctic Navarino Island, which is remote from nutrient pollution and subject to high UV beneath the southern ozone hole. 16S, 18S, 23S, and 28S ribosomal RNA sequences filtered from contigs assembled from long-read Roche 454 and deep short-read Illumina sequences were employed to infer prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiome composition at generic and higher levels for comparison to peat moss microbiota reported for other locales. Pivotal results. Comparison of bacterial diversity—including 175 genera represented by ≥100 sequence reads and 1250 genera represented by ≥10 reads—to diversity reported from previous peatland studies indicated the operation of recognized peatland functions (carbon sequestration, methane oxidation, and nitrogen fixation), signifying stress resilience. Eukaryotic features included 145 protist genera, some of pivotal evolutionary significance; distinctive fungal associations; and ancient lineages of microscopic invertebrate animals, including springtails known to foster moss reproduction. Conclusions. Metagenomic approaches provide a new, expanding window into early terrestrial vegetation and its biogeochemical effects, indicating that complex peat moss systems resilient to stressful environmental conditions likely occurred in deep time and persist to the present. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

  abstract={Sub-arctic birch forests (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. czerepanovii) periodically suffer large-scale defoliation events caused by the caterpillars of the geometrid moths Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata. Despite their obvious influence on ecosystem primary productivity, little is known about how the associated reduction in belowground C allocation affects soil processes. We quantified the soil response following a natural defoliation event in sub-arctic Sweden by measuring soil respiration, nitrogen availability and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) hyphal production and root tip community composition. There was a reduction in soil respiration and an accumulation of soil inorganic N in defoliated plots, symptomatic of a slowdown of soil processes. This coincided with a reduction of EMF hyphal production and a shift in the EMF community to lower autotrophic C-demanding lineages (for example, /russula-lactarius). We show that microbial and nutrient cycling processes shift to a slower, less C-demanding state in response to canopy defoliation. We speculate that, amongst other factors, a reduction in the potential of EMF biomass to immobilise excess mineral nitrogen resulted in its build-up in the soil. These defoliation events are becoming more geographically widespread with climate warming, and could result in a fundamental shift in sub-arctic ecosystem processes and properties. EMF fungi may be important in mediating the response of soil cycles to defoliation and their role merits further investigation. © 2016, The Author(s).},

  abstract={Endophytic fungi form mutualistic associations with plant roots which can increase plant survival and resistance to stress. Recently, it has been proposed that endophytic fungi from Antarctica should be used to facilitate reintroduction and establishment of native plants in xeric environments of northern Chile. In this note, we suggest this is a risky proposition and may lead to biological invasions. It is difficult to predict which endophytic fungi will become invasive, where they will invade, or what their impacts will be. Organisms that move across continents may or may not become invasive depending on the interaction between the species and the invaded community; unexpected outcomes may occur due to adaptation and novel interactions of the introduced species in the new environment. The fact that these endophytes are mutualistic does not imply that they will not have negative effects on the recipient community, since they might promote invasion of other non-native species or may change the competitive relationships among native species. Further, taxonomically uncharacterized fungal isolates from plant roots are likely to contain non-beneficial species. The fact that these endophytic fungi species are from Antarctica does not ensure that they cannot invade elsewhere. It should be recognized that invasive microorganisms are extremely difficult to control. We strongly suggest that the further translocation, use and spread of endophytes from Antarctica should be halted until a risk assessment is undertaken. Biosecurity measures must be taken when considering transcontinental experiments. Based on previous experiences, it is likely that the risk and potential costs of introducing these new species significantly exceed any potential benefits of their introductions. © 2015, Universidad Austral de Chile.

  abstract={The ongoing search for effective antiplasmodial agents remains essential in the fight against malaria worldwide. Emerging parasitic drug resistance places an urgent need to explore chemotherapies with novel structures and mechanisms of action. Natural products have historically provided effective antimalarial drug scaffolds. In an effort to search nature's chemical potential for antiplasmodial agents, unconventionally sourced organisms coupled with innovative cultivation techniques were utilized. Approximately 60,000 niche microbes from various habitats (slow-growing terrestrial fungi, Antarctic microbes, and mangrove endophytes) were cultivated on a small-scale, extracted, and used in high-throughput screening to determine antimalarial activity. About 1% of crude extracts were considered active and 6% partially active (≥67% inhibition at 5 and 50 μg/mL, respectively). Active extracts (685) were cultivated on a large-scale, fractionated, and screened for both antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity. High interest fractions (397) with an IC50 < 1.11 μg/mL were identified and subjected to chromatographic separation for compound characterization and dereplication. Identifying active compounds with nanomolar antimalarial activity coupled with a selectivity index tenfold higher was accomplished with two of the 52 compounds isolated. This microscale, high-throughput screening project for antiplasmodial agents is discussed in the context of current natural product drug discovery efforts. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract={Samples of the extremotolerant Antarctic endemite lichen Buellia frigida are currently exposed to low-Earth orbit-space and simulated Mars conditions at the Biology and Mars Experiment (BIOMEX), which is part of the ESA mission EXPOSE-R2 on the International Space Station and was launched on 23 July 2014. In preparation for the mission, several preflight tests (Experimental and Scientific Verification Tests, EVT and SVT) assessed the sample preparation and hardware integration procedures as well as the resistance of the candidate organism toward the abiotic stressors experienced under space and Mars conditions. Therefore, we quantified the post-exposure viability with a live/dead staining technique utilizing FUN-1 and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In addition, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate putative patterns of morphological-anatomical damage that lichens may suffer under the extreme exposure conditions. The present results demonstrate that Buellia frigida is capable of surviving the conditions tested in EVT and SVT. The mycobiont showed lower average impairment of its viability than the photobiont (viability rates of >83% and >69%, respectively), and the lichen thallus suffered no significant damage in terms of thalline integrity and symbiotic contact. These results will become essential to substantiate and validate the results prospectively obtained from the returning space mission. Moreover, they will help assess the limits and limitations of terrestrial organisms under space and Mars conditions as well as characterize the adaptive traits that confer lichen extremotolerance.

  abstract={Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems will in the near future be exposed to severe environmental stresses due to global warming. For example, the microbial community structure and function may change as a result of increased temperatures. In Greenland, agriculture is carried out in the Subarctic regions with only limited pest management, despite the presence of plant pathogenic fungi. The microbial community composition in agricultural soils, which plays an important role for soil and plant health and for crop yield, may be affected by the use of different fertilizer treatments. Currently, only limited research has been performed on the effects of these treatments on bacterial communities in Arctic and Subarctic agricultural soils. The major objective of this study was to investigate the short-term impact of conventional (NPK) and organic (sheep manure supplemented with nitrogen) fertilizer treatments on bacterial diversity, nutrient composition and crop yield in two Greenlandic agricultural soils. An effect of fertilizer was found on soil and plant nutrient levels and on crop yields. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences did not reveal any major changes in the overall bacterial community composition as a result of different fertilizer treatments, indicating a robust microbial community in these soils. In addition, differences in nutrient levels, crop yields and bacterial abundances were found between the two field sites and the two experimental growth seasons, which likely reflect differences in physical-chemical soil parameters. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Microbial communities were examined by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes (bacteria) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions (fungi). We studied four microbial compartments (inside leaf, inside root, rhizosphere and bulk soil) and characterized microbes associated with a single plant species (Deschampsia flexuosa) across two sand dune successional stages (early and late). Bacterial richness increased across succession in bulk soil and leaf endosphere. In contrast, soil fungal richness remained constant while root endosphere fungal richness increased across succession. There was, however, no significant difference in Shannon diversity indices between early and late successional stage in any compartment. There was a significant difference in the composition of microbial communities between early and late successional stage in all compartments, although the major microbial OTUs were shared between early and late successional stage. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed successional stage-specific microbial groups. There were more co-occurring modules in early successional stage than in late stage. Altogether, these results emphasize that succession strongly affects distribution of microbial species, but not microbial diversity in arctic sand dune ecosystem and that fungi and bacteria may not follow the same successional trajectories. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Investment in extracellular enzyme production may be an important element of the survival strategy of these fungi in maritime Antarctic soils. This study focuses on fungi that were isolated from ornithogenic, undisturbed and human-impacted soils collected from the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, during the austral summer in February 2007. We (1) describe fungal diversity based on molecular approaches, (2) describe the thermal characteristics of the fungal isolates, and (3) screen extracellular hydrolase enzyme production (amylase and cellulase) by the isolates. Soil samples were cultured using the Warcup soil plating technique and incubated at 4 and 25 °C to allow basic thermal classification. In total, 101 isolates were obtained. All the isolates were screened at culture temperatures of 4 and 25 °C in order to detect activity of extracellular hydrolase enzymes. At 25 °C, ornithogenic penguin rookery soils recorded the lowest diversity of fungi, with little difference in diversity apparent between the other soils examined. At 4 °C, an undisturbed site recorded the lowest and a human-impacted site the highest diversity of fungi. The majority of the fungi identified in this study were in the mesophilic thermal class. Six strains possessed significant activity for amylase and 13 for cellulase at 25 °C. At 4 °C, four strains showed significant amylase and 22 significant cellulase activity.

  abstract={The Earth's crust hosts a subsurface, dark, and oligotrophic biosphere that is poorly understood in terms of the energy supporting its biomass production and impact on food webs at the Earth's surface. Dark oligotrophic volcanic ecosystems (DOVEs) are good environments for investigations of life in the absence of sunlight as they are poor in organics, rich in chemical reactants and well known for chemical exchange with Earth's surface systems. Ice caves near the summit of Mt. Erebus (Antarctica) offer DOVEs in a polar alpine environment that is starved in organics and with oxygenated hydrothermal circulation in highly reducing host rock. We surveyed the microbial communities using PCR, cloning, sequencing and analysis of the small subunit (16S) ribosomal and Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (RubisCO) genes in sediment samples from three different caves, two that are completely dark and one that receives snow-filtered sunlight seasonally. The microbial communities in all three caves are composed primarily of Bacteria and fungi; Archaea were not detected. The bacterial communities from these ice caves display low phylogenetic diversity, but with a remarkable diversity of RubisCO genes including new deeply branching Form I clades, implicating the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle as a pathway of CO2 fixation. The microbial communities in one of the dark caves, Warren Cave, which has a remarkably low phylogenetic diversity, were analyzed in more detail to gain a possible perspective on the energetic basis of the microbial ecosystem in the cave. Atmospheric carbon (CO2 and CO), including from volcanic emissions, likely supplies carbon and/or some of the energy requirements of chemoautotrophic microbial communities in Warren Cave and probably other Mt. Erebus ice caves. Our work casts a first glimpse at Mt. Erebus ice caves as natural laboratories for exploring carbon, energy and nutrient sources in the subsurface biosphere and the nutritional limits on life. © 2015 Tebo, Davis, Anitori, Connell, Schiffman and Staudigel.},

  abstract={Studies of Antarctic eukaryotes have been hampered by their morphological conservatism, small size and the logistical constraints of remote field work, resulting in a deficiency of baseline biodiversity information about Antarctic terrestrial environments. The application of high throughput sequencing (HTS) in metataxonomic approaches is a promising alternative. Here, we apply such HTS approaches to the hitherto largely unsurveyed micro-eukaryote fauna of the Prince Charles Mountains, East Antarctica. We sequenced 18S rDNA amplicons of twelve Antarctic bulk-soil DNA extracts, retrieved from three sampling regions (four bulk-soil extracts per sampling region). After isolating eukaryotic phylotypes with a stringent filtering approach and initial network visualization, we firstly used rarefied data to compare four α diversity metrics between the three regions. Weighted and unweighted inter-sample UniFrac distances were then used for β diversity comparisons among rarefied data. Furthermore, we analysed the distribution of the most abundant phylotypes and phylotype groups. Lastly, we checked the validity of species-level taxonomic assignments using different sets of reference data in conjunction with two different taxonomy assignment approaches. Phylotype numbers in un-rarefied data compared across regions were lowest for Mount Menzies (73°S; 3330 m), intermediate at Mawson Escarpment (73°S; 807 m) and highest at Lake Terrasovoje (70°S; 173 m), likely due to low biological load at the higher latitude and elevation inland sites. Analysis of rarefied data was difficult due to low sequence coverage particularly from Mount Menzies, but indicated differences in Shannon diversity between Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje. PCoA of weighted UniFrac distances between samples from Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje indicated changes in community composition in relation to elevation of the sampling locations. The most widespread phylotypes were fungal, followed by non-algal protists. Species-level assignments included known Antarctic taxa in all sampling regions. We show that HTS can provide a rapid survey of the micro-eukaryote fauna to provide baseline biodiversity information for remote, harsh, and hitherto largely unsurveyed environments in the Prince Charles Mountains. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract={Dwarf shrubs of the family Ericaceae are common in arctic and alpine regions. Many of these plants are associated with ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) fungi, which allow them to take nutrients and water from the soil under harsh environmental conditions and, thus, affect host plant survival. Despite the importance of ERM fungi to alpine plant communities, limited information is available on the effects of microhabitat and host identity on ERM fungal communities. We investigated the communities of putative ERM fungi isolated from five dwarf shrub species (Arcterica nana, Diapensia lapponica, Empetrum nigrum, Loiseleuria procumbens, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) that co-occur in an alpine region of Japan, with reference to distinct microhabitats provided by large stone pine (Pinus pumila) shrubs (i.e. bare ground, the edge of stone pine shrubs, and the inside of stone pine shrubs). We obtained 703 fungal isolates from 222 individual plants. These isolates were classified into 55 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the sequencing of internal transcribed spacer regions in ribosomal DNA. These putative ERM fungal communities were dominated by Helotiales fungi for all host species. Cistella and Trimmatostroma species, which have rarely been detected in ERM roots in previous studies, were abundant. ERM fungal communities were significantly different among microhabitats (R2=0.28), while the host effect explained less variance in the fungal communities after excluding the microhabitat effect (R2=0.17). Our results suggest that the host effect on ERM fungal communities is minor and the distributions of hosts and fungal communities may be assessed based on microhabitat conditions. © 2017, Japanese Society of Microbial Ecology.

A total of thirteen soil samples were collected and soil fungal community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing with fungi-specific primers targeting the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The following eight soil properties were analyzed: pH, organic carbon (C), organic nitrogen (N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), silicate silicon (SiO42--Si), nitrite nitrogen (NO2--N), phosphate phosphorus (PO43--P), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N). A total of 57,952 reads belonging to 541 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found. of these OTUs, 343 belonged to Ascomycota, 100 to Basidiomycota, 31 to Chytridiomycota, 22 to Glomeromycota, 11 to Zygomycota, 10 to Rozellomycota, whereas 24 belonged to unknown fungi. The dominant orders were Helotiales, Verrucariales, Agaricales, Lecanorales, Chaetothyriales, Lecideales, and Capnodiales. The common genera (> eight soil samples) were Tetracladium, Mortierella, Fusarium, Cortinarius, and Atla. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-rda) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) revealed that soil pH (p = 0.001) was the most significant factor in determining the soil fungal community composition. Members of Verrucariales were found to predominate in soils of pH 8-9, whereas Sordariales predominated in soils of pH 7-8 and Coniochaetales predominated in soils of pH 6-7. The results suggest the presence and distribution of diverse soil fungal communities in the High Arctic, which can provide reliable data for studying the ecological responses of soil fungal communities to climate changes in the Arctic. © 2016 Zhang, Wang, Liu, Zhang and Yu.},

They can develop diverse trapping devices, such as adhesive hyphae, adhesive knobs, adhesive networks, constricting rings, and nonconstricting rings. Nematode-trapping fungi have been found in all regions of the world, from the tropics to Antarctica, from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. They play an important ecological role in regulating nematode dynamics in soil. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the majority of nematode-trapping fungi belong to a monophyletic group in the order Orbiliales (Ascomycota). Nematode-trapping fungi serve as an excellent model system for understanding fungal evolution and interaction between fungi and nematodes. With the development of molecular techniques and genome sequencing, their evolutionary origins and divergence, and the mechanisms underlying fungus-nematode interactions have been well studied. In recent decades, an increasing concern about the environmental hazards of using chemical nematicides has led to the application of these biological control agents as a rapidly developing component of crop protection. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

The fish were evaluated for growth performance, nutrient digestibility and fish intestinal function. Growth performance, retention of crude protein and sum of amino acids were not affected in fish fed diets ISC or MYE compared with those fed the reference (REF) diet. However, fish fed diet ISC displayed decreased digestibility of crude protein and indispensable amino acids and decreased intestinal barrier function compared with fish fed the REF diet. Fish fed diet ESC exhibited decreased growth performance and protein retention, but had comparable digestibility to fish fed the REF diet. Fish fed diets MYE and RHO showed similar performance in terms of growth, nutrient digestibility and intestinal barrier function.

  abstract={Antarctica is a pristine and extreme environment that represents a unique opportunity for taxonomic, ecological and biotechnological studies of the microorganisms. In the present work, the fungal communities of rhizosphere soil of Deschampsia antarctica, soil, ornithogenic soil, marine and lake sediments in the Antarctic Peninsula were characterized as well as their capability to produce bioactive compounds. One hundred fungal isolates were recovered and identified by molecular analysis in 35 different taxa of 20 genera. Pseudogymnoascus sp. 1 and 3, Penicillium sp., Peniophora sp. and Mortierella alpina were the most frequent taxa identified. All isolates were cultured to produce ethanolic extracts, which were assayed against different target organisms to detect antimicrobial (against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis), cytotoxic (against breast MCF-7 and renal TK-10 human tumoral cells) and antiprotozoal (against Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi) activities. Among the three human pathogenic fungal species, 20 extracts showed moderate to high and selective antifungal activity against P. brasiliensis. The extract of Purpureocillium lilacinum displayed high trypanocidal, antifungal and antibacterial activities, but with moderate toxicity over normal cells. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectral analysis indicated the presence of compounds containing a highly functionalized aromatic ring system. Our results suggest that the Antarctic ecosystems represent an interesting habitat for the isolation and characterization of fungal taxa capable to producing bioactive compounds. The fungus P. lilacinum showed strong trypanocidal and antimicrobial activities with moderate toxicity over normal cells, which might be used as scaffold for the development of new drugs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Interestingly, most fungal OTUs were closely related to fungi from various habitats (e.g., soil, rock, plant tissues) in the Arctic, Antarctic and alpine regions, which suggests that living in association with lichen thalli may be a transient stage of life cycle for these fungi and that long-distance dispersal may be important to the fungi in the Arctic. In addition, host-related factors shaped the lichen-associated fungal communities in this region. Taken together, these results suggest that lichens thalli act as reservoirs of diverse fungi from various niches, which may improve our understanding of fungal evolution and ecology in the Arctic.},

  abstract={Antarctic microorganisms have developed different strategies to live in their environments, including modifications to their membrane components to regulate fluidity and the production of photoprotective metabolites such as carotenoids. Three yeast colonies (ANCH01, ANCH06 and ANCH08) were isolated from soil samples collected at King George Island, which according to their rDNA sequence analyses, were determined to be Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. This yeast is of biotechnological interest, because it can synthesize astaxanthin as its main carotenoid, which is a powerful antioxidant pigment used in aquaculture. Then, the aim of this work was to characterize the ANCH isolates at their molecular and phenotypic level. The isolates did not display any differences in their rDNA and COX1 gene nucleotide sequences. However, ANCH01 produces approximately sixfold more astaxanthin than other wild type strains. Moreover, even though ANCH06 and ANCH08 produce astaxanthin, their main carotenoid was β-carotene. In contrast to other X. dendrorhous strains, the ANCH isolates did not produce mycosporines. Finally, the ANCH isolates had a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids than other wild type strains. In conclusion, the reported X. dendrorhous isolates are phenotypically different from other wild type strains, including characteristics that could make them more resistant and better able to inhabit their original habitat, which may also have biotechnological potential. © 2015, The Author(s).},

  abstract={In High Arctic ecosystems, plant growth and reproduction are limited by low soil moisture and nutrient availability, low soil and air temperatures, and a short growing season. Mycorrhizal associations facilitate plant nutrient acquisition and water uptake and may therefore be particularly ecologically important in nutrition-poor and dry environments, such as parts of the Arctic. Similarly, endophytic root associates are thought to play a protective role, increasing plants' stress tolerance, and likely have an important ecosystem function. Despite the importance of these root-associated fungi, little is known about their host specificity in the Arctic. We investigated the host specificity of root-associated fungi in the common, widely distributed arctic plant species Bistorta vivipara, Salix polaris and Dryas octopetala in the High Arctic archipelago Svalbard. High-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplified from whole root systems generated no evidence of host specificity and no spatial autocorrelation within two 3 m × 3 m sample plots. The lack of spatial structure at small spatial scales indicates that Common Mycelial Networks (CMNs) are rare in marginal arctic environments. Moreover, no significant differences in fungal OTU richness were observed across the three plant species, although their root system characteristics (size, biomass) differed considerably. Reasons for lack of host specificity could be that association with generalist fungi may allow arctic plants to more rapidly and easily colonize newly available habitats, and it may be favourable to establish symbiotic relationships with fungi possessing different physiological attributes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={Space represents an extremely harmful environment for life and survival of terrestrial organisms. In the last decades, a considerable deal of attention was paid to characterize the effects of spaceflight relevant radiation on various model organisms. The aim of this study was to test the survival capacity of the cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 to space relevant radiation, to outline its endurance to space conditions. In the frame of an international radiation campaign, dried fungal colonies were irradiated with accelerated Helium ion (150 MeV/n, LET 2.2 keV/μm), up to a final dose of 1,000 Gy, as one of the space-relevant ionizing radiation. Results showed that the fungus maintained high survival and metabolic activity with no detectable DNA and ultrastructural damage, even after the highest dose irradiation. These data give clues on the resistance of life toward space ionizing radiation in general and on the resistance and responses of eukaryotic cells in particular. © 2017 Pacelli, Selbmann, Moeller, Zucconi, Fujimori and Onofri.},

  abstract={Desiccation tolerance is a feature of most lichens. These symbiotic associations of a fungal partner (mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (photobiont) experience severe desiccation on a regular basis. Many lichen species colonise extreme habitats, such as the cold deserts of Antarctica. Although the stress physiology of lichens has been studied extensively, little is known about the photobionts' physiological potential. To assess the contribution of photobionts to lichen success in Antarctic terrestrial environments, the photosynthetic partners of Umbilicaria decussate (Umbilicariaceae, lichenised ascomycetes) and Usnea lambii (Parmeliaceae, lichenised ascomycetes) from extreme habitats in southern Antarctica were isolated. Significant differences regarding stress tolerance of the two green algae had bee shown previously despite their close phylogenetic relationship. A deeper understanding and explanation of thes differences were obtained by examination of the metabolite profiles and dynamics, especially the role of sugars, polyol and amino acids. High concentrations of ribitol and sucrose, among other metabolites, characterised the photobiont o Usnea lambii's mainly constitutive strategy of desiccation tolerance. A high degree of specialisation to dry environment can be assumed for this photobiont. © 2016 International Phycological Society.},

  abstract={During the summer months, wet (hyporheic) soils associated with ephemeral streams and lake edges in the Antarctic Dry Valleys (DVs) become hotspots of biological activity and are hypothesized to be an important source of carbon and nitrogen for arid DV soils. Recent research in the DV has focused on the geochemistry and microbial ecology of lakes and arid soils, with substantially less information being available on hyporheic soils. Here, we determined the unique properties of hyporheic microbial communities, resolved their relationship to environmental parameters and compared them to archetypal arid DV soils. Generally, pH increased and chlorophyll a concentrations decreased along transects from wet to arid soils (9.0 to ~7.0 for pH and ~0.8 to ~5 μg/cm3 for chlorophyll a, respectively). Soil water content decreased to below ~3% in the arid soils. Community fingerprinting-based principle component analyses revealed that bacterial communities formed distinct clusters specific to arid and wet soils; however, eukaryotic communities that clustered together did not have similar soil moisture content nor did they group together based on sampling location. Collectively, rRNA pyrosequencing indicated a considerably higher abundance of Cyanobacteria in wet soils and a higher abundance of Acidobacterial, Actinobacterial, Deinococcus/Thermus, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospira, and Planctomycetes in arid soils. The two most significant differences at the genus level were Gillisia signatures present in arid soils and chloroplast signatures related to Streptophyta that were common in wet soils. Fungal dominance was observed in arid soils and Viridiplantae were more common in wet soils. This research represents an in-depth characterization of microbial communities inhabiting wet DV soils. Results indicate that the repeated wetting of hyporheic zones has a profound impact on the bacterial and eukaryotic communities inhabiting in these areas. © 2015 Niederberger, Sohm, Gunderson, Parker, Tirindelli, Capone, Carpenter and Cary.},

  abstract={The distribution of the fungal biomass and diversity of cultivated microscopic fungi in the profiles of some soils from East (Progress Station, valleys of the Larsemann Hills oasis) and West (Russkaya Station, the Marie Byrd Land) Antarctica regions were studied. The structure of the biomass (spore/mycelium and live cells/dead cells) was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with staining using a set of coloring agents: calcofluor white, ethidium bromide, and fluorescein diacetate. The species composition of the cultivated microscopic fungi was determined on Czapek’s medium. The fungal biomass in the soils studied is not high (on the average, 0.3 mg/g of soil); the greatest biomass (0.6 mg/g) was found in the soil samples with plant residues. The fungal biomass is mainly (to 70%) represented by small (to 2.5 μm) spores. About half of the fungal biomass is composed of living cells. There are differences in the distribution of the fungal biomass within the profiles of different primitive soils. In the soil samples taken under mosses and lichens, the maximal biomass was registered in the top soil horizons. In the soils with the peat horizon under stone pavements, the greatest fungal biomass was registered in the subsurface horizons. Thirty-eight species of cultivated microscopic fungi were isolated from the soils studied. Species of the genus Penicillium and Phoma herbarum predominated. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  abstract={Contrary to earlier assumptions, molecular evidence has demonstrated the presence of diverse and localized soil bacterial communities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether fungal signals so far detected in Dry Valley soils using both culture-based and molecular techniques represent adapted and ecologically active biomass or spores transported by wind. Through a systematic and quantitative molecular survey, we identified significant heterogeneities in soil fungal communities across the Dry Valleys that robustly correlate with heterogeneities in soil physicochemical properties. Community fingerprinting analysis and 454 pyrosequencing of the fungal ribosomal intergenic spacer region revealed different levels of heterogeneity in fungal diversity within individual Dry Valleys and a surprising abundance of Chytridiomycota species, whereas previous studies suggested that Dry Valley soils were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Critically, we identified significant differences in fungal community composition and structure of adjacent sites with no obvious barrier to aeolian transport between them. These findings suggest that edaphic fungi of the Antarctic Dry Valleys are adapted to local environments and represent an ecologically relevant (and possibly important) heterotrophic component of the ecosystem. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Bryoplaca is reported as a new host genus for Merismatium nigritellum agg., Cetrelia for Cornutispora lichenicola and Echinothecium reticulatum, Flavoparmelia for Cornutispora ciliata, and Pseudevernia for Lichenoconium cargillianum. A synopsis of 248 species from 98 genera of lichenicolous fungi and three species from two additional genera of allied fungi so far known from the Caucasus is presented and analyzed. The most species-rich genera are Stigmidium, Arthonia and Abrothallus. 81% of the lichenicolous fungi species were found on only one host genus. The value of the ‘parasite genera:host genera’ ratio is about 1:1. The most frequently parasitized lichen genera are Lecanora s. l., Parmelia, Peltigera, Cladonia and Physcia. About half of the species found in the Caucasus occur outside the Holarctic. The lichenicolous index for the Russian Caucasus is approximately 0.2. The most frequently collected species were Lichenostigma maureri, Marchandiomyces corallinus, Lichenoconium erodens, L. lecanorae and Nesolechia oxyspora. About 25% of the detected species were considered visible to the naked eye, 60% were clearly visible only at 10× magnification, and 15% only at 20-40× magnification. © 2017, New York Botanical Garden .

Chronic ulceration may provide microenvironments that disturb the normal microbial biodiversity of external surfaces. Studying the composition of microbial communities in skin ulcers will enhance our understanding of ulcer aetiology. To achieve this, we tested marine farmed Atlantic salmon and sampled the base and edge of ulcers at the end of winter (April) and end of summer (September), in addition to skin mucus of healthy individuals. In order to assess microbiota associated with the host and obtain insight into the environmental ecology, we also sampled sea water, the sediment layer underneath the farm facility and the distal intestine of Atlantic salmon. The skin microbiota of Atlantic salmon was different from that of the surrounding water. Residential Tenacibaculum and Arcobacter species persistently dominated the cutaneous skin and ulcer mucus surfaces of Atlantic salmon during both winter and summer periods. The intestinal microbiota was dominated by Mycoplasma with an increase in Aliivibrio and Alcaligenes abundance in the intestine of fish with ulcerative disorder at the end of winter.

  abstract={Extremely acidic soils (pH < 3) harbour poorly diversified mycobiota that are very different from less acidic habitats. During investigations of the mycobiota from several highly acidic soils in the Czech Republic and a coastal site in the Antarctic Peninsula, a group of hyaline fungal isolates was obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS region, SSU, LSU), the isolates belonged to three phylogenetic lineages within two different classes, Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes (Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). The first lineage is described here as a new genus and species Acidothrix acidophila gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Amplistromataceae, Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota). The most closely related species to this new clade are wood-inhabiting fungi. The isolates belonging to the second and the third lineages are also described as two new genera and species Acidea extrema gen. nov. et sp. nov. and Soosiella minima gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Helotiales, Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota). Their position and the relationships within Helotiales are discussed. Soosiella minima was acidotolerant, Acidothrix acidophila and Acidea extrema exhibited both acidotolerant and acidophilic characteristics. All the species were slightly halophilic. The adaptation of hyaline fungi from mesophilic lineages to highly acidic environments has been revealed.

  abstract={Active layer detachments (ALDs) are permafrost disturbances associated with climate change and increased seasonal warming. Such perturbations result from thawing of the upper permafrost and downslope movement of the overlying thawed material, including the active layer. ALDs have the potential to impact soil microbial community composition and function in arctic soil ecosystems. Here we report an initial investigation of an ALD located at Cape Bounty on Melville Island in the Canadian High Arctic. We examined soil nutrient content as well as microbial community structure using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Soil from the disturbed site showed changes in microbial communities with strikingly different fungal community composition compared to soils from an adjacent undisturbed site. These community changes were correlated with enhanced levels of dissolved organic carbon, microbial carbon, total dissolved nitrogen, and microbial nitrogen. The Nitrososphaerales-an order of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea-were more abundant in the disturbed soil and may have been responsible for the altered nitrogen cycling that resulted in higher levels of total dissolved nitrogen there. The fungal communities at both sites were dominated by orders within the Ascomycota, a phylum of mainly hyphal fungi. Intriguingly however, they were more numerous in the undisturbed soil compared to the disturbed soil, suggesting that certain Ascomycota could not reestablish within six years of the ALD, and more generally that fungal hyphal networks may help to stabilize tundra surface soils against erosional losses. © 2017 Regents of the UniveRsity of Colorado.},

  abstract={Lichens are the symbiotic association of fungi and a photosynthetic partner. However, non-phototrophic bacteria are also present and thought to comprise an essential part of the lichen symbiosis, although their roles in the symbiosis are still poorly understood. In this study, we isolated and characterized 110 non-phototrophic bacterial lichen associates from thalli of the terricolous lichen Peltigera membranacea. The biodegradative and other nutrient-scavenging properties studied among selected isolates were phosphate mobilization, biosurfactant production and degradation of napthalene and several biopolymers, suggesting organic and inorganic nutrient scavenging as roles for bacteria in the lichen symbiotic association. Identification by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the isolates comprised 18 genera within the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, many with high similarities with bacteria typically associated with the plant and rhizosphere environments, could suggest that plants may be important sources of terricolous lichen-associated bacteria, or vice versa. © FEMS 2016.},

  abstract={Browning Peninsula is an ice-free polar desert situated in the Windmill Islands, Eastern Antarctica. The entire site is described as a barren landscape, comprised of frost boils with soils dominated by microbial life. In this study, we explored the microbial diversity and edaphic drivers of community structure across this site using traditional cultivation methods, a novel approach the soil substrate membrane system (SSMS), and culture-independent 454-tag pyrosequencing. The measured soil environmental and microphysical factors of chlorine, phosphate, aspect and elevation were found to be significant drivers of the bacterial community, while none of the soil parameters analyzed were significantly correlated to the fungal community. Overall, Browning Peninsula soil harbored a distinctive microbial community in comparison to other Antarctic soils comprised of a unique bacterial diversity and extremely limited fungal diversity. Tag pyrosequencing data revealed the bacterial community to be dominated by Actinobacteria (36%), followed by Chloroflexi (18%), Cyanobacteria (14%), and Proteobacteria (10%). For fungi, Ascomycota (97%) dominated the soil microbiome, followed by Basidiomycota. As expected the diversity recovered from culture-based techniques was lower than that detected using tag sequencing. However, in the SSMS enrichments, that mimic the natural conditions for cultivating oligophilic "k-selected" bacteria, a larger proportion of rare bacterial taxa (15%), such as Blastococcus, Devosia, Herbaspirillum, Propionibacterium and Methylocella and fungal (11%) taxa, such as Nigrospora, Exophiala, Hortaea, and Penidiella were recovered at the genus level. At phylum level, a comparison of OTU's showed that the SSMS shared 21% of Acidobacteria, 11% of Actinobacteria and 10% of Proteobacteria OTU's with soil. For fungi, the shared OTUs was 4% (Basidiomycota) and < 0.5% (Ascomycota). This was the first known attempt to culture microfungi using the SSMS which resulted in an increase in diversity from 14 to 57 microfungi OTUs compared to standard cultivation. Furthermore, the SSMS offers the opportunity to retrieve a greater diversity of bacterial and fungal taxa for future exploitation. © 2017 Pudasaini, Wilson, Ji, van Dorst, Snape, Palmer, Burns and Ferrari.},

  abstract={Very little is known about fungal diversity in Antarctica as compared to other biomes and how these important organisms function in this unusual ecosystem. Perhaps one of the most unusual ecosystems is that of Deception Island; an active volcanic island part of the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula. Here we describe the fungal diversity associated with historic wood from structures on the island, which reveals a diverse fungal assemblage of known wood decay fungi as well as the discovery of undescribed species. The major group of wood decay fungi identified were species of Cadophora and as shown in previous studies in other geographic regions of Antarctica, they caused a soft-rot type of decay in the introduced woods. Additionally, unlike other areas of Antarctica that have been studied, filamentous basidiomycetes (Hypochniciellum spp. and Pholiota spp.) were also identified that have different modes of degradation including brown and white rot. Matches of fungal sequences to known species in temperate regions likely introduced on building materials indicates human influences and volcanic activity have greatly impacted fungal diversity. Lahars (mudslides from volcanic activity) have partially buried many of the structures and the buried environment as well as the moist, warm soils provided conditions conducive for fungal growth that are not found in other regions of Antarctica. The diverse assemblage of decay fungi and different forms of wood decomposition add to the difficulty of conserving wooden structures at these important polar heritage sites. © 2016 British Mycological Society},

  abstract={A wide diversity of micromycetes from various taxonomic groups in acidic and neutral soils is known from the literature data. In the present work, the fungi isolated from these soils and capable of growth at high pH are analyzed. The fungi were isolated from acidic sod-podzol and neutral cultivated soils by plating on alkaline agar (pH 10.0–10.5). Their identification was carried out using morphological, cultural, and molecular genetic criteria. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and the rates of linear growth within a broad pH range (4.0–10.4) were determined. The isolates represented a polyphyletic group of ascomycetes (Sordariomycetes), which included members of Plectosphaerellaceae (5 species) and various families of Hypocreales (4 species). The most common species were Gibellulopsis nigrescens, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus, Chordomyces antarcticum, and Plectosphaerella spp. Investigation of fungal growth at different pH values revealed all isolates to be alkalitolerant, with no alkaliphilic fungi isolated from acidic sod-podzol and neutral cultivated soils. Although the group of isolates was polyphyletic and its members originated from different ecological and trophic niches, most alkalitolerant isolates exhibited common morphological traits with acremonium- and verticillium-like conidial spore formation, abundant slime formation, and a tendency for aggregation of their mycelium in bundles. Our research confirmed the presence of fungi with alkalitolerant adaptation to external pH in the sod-podzolic and cultivated soils of the Moscow region. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  abstract={Fish meal is the major source of animal protein in feed for cultured salmonid fish, but its availability is limited and it must eventually be replaced by alternative protein-rich feed ingredients. Zygomycetes (Rhizopus oryzae) is a fungus with protein-rich biomass that could replace fish meal protein in fish feed. Using an 1H NMR spectroscopy approach, we studied the metabolic pattern in liver tissues of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) fed a commercial diet with unknown composition (ST), a diet with all protein from fish meal (FM) and a diet with most of the protein from zygomycetes biomass (FZ). No significant difference (p ≥ 0.05) was found in spectral data between FM and FZ using the OPLS-DA fitted model. However, other models showed that diet ST clearly differed (p < 0.05) from diets FM and FZ. Signals for acetate, β-alanine, choline, creatine, formate, glucose, inosine, lysine, SN-glycero-3-phosphocholine and two unknown metabolites were higher in fish fed diets FM and FZ than in fish fed diet ST. These results show that the metabolic profile in liver of Arctic charr will remain unchanged if fish meal protein is replaced with zygomycete protein, suggesting similar physiological responses to both feed ingredients. In contrast, feeding a commercial diet altered the metabolic fingerprint compared with diets FZ and FM, suggesting important differences in ingredient composition and the physiological response to this diet. © 2014 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Bacterial growth at low pressure is a new research area with implications for predicting microbial activity in clouds and the bulk atmosphere on Earth and for modeling the forward contamination of planetary surfaces like Mars. Here, we describe experiments on the recovery and identification of 20 species of bacterial hypobarophiles (def., growth under hypobaric conditions of approximately 1-2 kPa) in 10 genera capable of growth at 0.7 kPa. Hypobarophilic bacteria, but not archaea or fungi, were recovered from diverse soils, and high numbers of hypobarophiles were recovered from Arctic and Siberian permafrost soils. Isolates were identified through 16S rRNA sequencing to belong to the genera Bacillus, Carnobacterium, Clostridium, Cryobacterium, Exiguobacterium, Paenibacillus, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, and Trichococcus. The highest population of culturable hypobarophilic bacteria (5.1 × 104 cfu/g) was recovered from Colour Lake soils from Axel Heiberg Island in the Canadian Arctic. In addition, we extend the number of hypobarophilic species in the genus Serratia to six type-strains that include S. ficaria, S. fonticola, S. grimesii, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, and S. quinivorans. Microbial growth at 0.7 kPa suggests that pressure alone will not be growth-limiting on the martian surface, or in Earth's atmosphere up to an altitude of 34 km. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

  abstract={In terrestrial ecosystems, plant species and diverse root-associated fungi form complex networks of host-symbiont associations. Recent studies have revealed that structures of those below-ground plant-fungus networks differ between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Nonetheless, we still remain ignorant of how ericaceous plant species, which dominate arctic and alpine tundra, constitute networks with their root-associated fungi. Based on a high-throughput DNA sequencing data set, we characterized the statistical properties of a network involving 16 ericaceous plant species and more than 500 fungal taxa in the alpine-subalpine region of Mt. Tateyama, central Japan. While all the 16 ericaceous species were associated mainly with fungi in the order Helotiales, they varied remarkably in association with fungi in other orders such as Sebacinales, Atheliales, Agaricales, Russulales and Thelephorales. The ericaceous plant-fungus network was characterized by high symbiont/host preferences. Moreover, the network had a characteristic structure called ‘anti-nestedness’, which has been previously reported in ectomycorrhizal plant-fungus networks. The results lead to the hypothesis that ericaceous plants in harsh environments can host unexpectedly diverse root-associated fungal taxa, constituting networks whose structures are similar to those of previously reported ectomycorrhizal networks but not to those of arbuscular mycorrhizal ones. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Two analyses were performed to reveal the phylogenetic relationships of the putative new species with other Penicillium species. Phylogenetically, the new species are related to the members of the P. canescens group and share some morphological and physiological features with them. However, they differ in having a larger colony diameter that makes them similar to P. atrovenetum, P. coralligerum, and P. antarcticum. A detailed analysis based on ITS, combined β-tubulin and calmodulin datasets, and morphological features revealed that the new species formed a distinct group inside the P. atrovenetum subclade. Moreover, P. attenuatum differs from the other two species macro- and micromorphologically and may represent a distinct phylogenetic lineage. © 2016, German Mycological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A total of 115 fungal isolates were obtained and identified in 11 taxa of Aspergillus, Debaryomyces, Cladosporium, Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium and Hypocreales. The fungal community showed low diversity and richness, and high dominance indices. The extracts of Aspergillus sydowii, Penicillium allii-sativi, Penicillium brevicompactum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium rubens possess antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antitumoral, herbicidal and antiprotozoal activities. Bioactive extracts were examined using 1H NMR spectroscopy and detected the presence of secondary metabolites with chemical shifts. Our results show that the fungi present in cold-oligotrophic soil from Antarctica included few dominant species, which may have important implications for understanding eukaryotic survival in cold-arid oligotrophic soils. We hypothesize that detailed further investigations may provide a greater understanding of the evolution of Antarctic fungi and their relationships with other organisms described in that region. Additionally, different wild pristine bioactive fungal isolates found in continental Antarctic soil may represent a unique source to discover prototype molecules for use in drug and biopesticide discovery studies. © 2015, Springer Japan.},

Although much work has concentrated on BSC microbial communities, free-living fungi have been hitherto largely overlooked. The aim of this study was to examine the fungal biodiversity, by cultural-dependent and cultural-independent approaches, in thirteen samples of Arctic BSCs collected at different sites in the Alpine Tarfala Valley, located on the slopes of Kebnekaise, the highest mountain in northern Scandinavia. Isolated fungi were identified by both microscopic observation and molecular approaches. Data revealed that the fungal assemblage composition was homogeneous among the BSCs analyzed, with low biodiversity and the presence of a few dominant species; the majority of fungi isolated belonged to the Ascomycota, and Cryptococcus gilvescens and Pezoloma ericae were the most frequently-recorded species. Ecological considerations for the species involved and the implication of our findings for future fungal research in BSCs are put forward. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, the microbial community associated with this habitat remains poorly understood. Our objective was to investigate the functional capacities, diversity and dynamics of the microorganisms in snow and to test the hypothesis that their functional signature reflects the snow environment. We applied a metagenomic approach to nine snow samples taken over 2 months during the spring season. Fungi, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were predominant in metagenomic datasets and changes in community structure were apparent throughout the field season. Functional data that strongly correlated with chemical parameters like mercury or nitrogen species supported that this variation could be explained by fluctuations in environmental conditions. Through inter-environmental comparisons we examined potential drivers of snowpack microbial community functioning. Known cold adaptations were detected in all compared environments without any apparent differences in their relative abundance, implying that adaptive mechanisms related to environmental factors other than temperature may play a role in defining the snow microbial community. Photochemical reactions and oxidative stress seem to be decisive parameters in structuring microbial communities inside Arctic snowpacks. © 2014 Maccario, Vogel and Larose.},

  abstract={This study assessed the diversity and distribution of endophytic fungal communities associated with the leaves and stems of four vascular plant species in the High Arctic using 454 pyrosequencing with fungal-specific primers targeting the ITS region. Endophytic fungal communities showed high diversity. The 76,691 sequences obtained belonged to 250 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Of these OTUs, 190 belonged to Ascomycota, 50 to Basidiomycota, 1 to Chytridiomycota, and 9 to unknown fungi. The dominant orders were Helotiales, Pleosporales, Capnodiales, and Tremellales, whereas the common known fungal genera were Cryptococcus, Rhizosphaera, Mycopappus, Melampsora, Tetracladium, Phaeosphaeria, Mrakia, Venturia, and Leptosphaeria. Both the climate and host-related factors might shape the fungal communities associated with the four Arctic plant species in this region. These results suggested the presence of an interesting endophytic fungal community and could improve our understanding of fungal evolution and ecology in the Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. © 2015 Zhang, Yao.

Recent findings suggest that fungal communities associated with B. vivipara roots appear random over short distances, but at larger scales, environmental filtering structure fungal communities. Habitats in highly stressful environments where specialist species with narrower niches may have an advantage represent unique opportunity to test the effect of environmental filtering. We utilised high-throughput amplicon sequencing to identify ECM communities associated with B. vivipara in Svalbard. We compared ECM communities in a core habitat where B. vivipara is frequent (Dryas-heath) with edge habitats representing extremes in terms of nutrient availability where B. vivipara is less frequent (bird-manured meadow and a nutrient-depleted mine tilling). Our analysis revealed that soil conditions in edge habitats favour less diverse but more distinct ECM fungal communities with functional traits adapted to local conditions. ECM richness was overall lower in both edge habitats, and the taxonomic compositions of ECM fungi were in line with our functional expectations. Stress-tolerant genera such as Laccaria and Hebeloma were abundant in nutrient-poor mine site whereas functional competitors genera such as Lactarius and Russula were dominant in the nutrient-rich bird-cliff site. Our results suggest that ECM communities in rare edge habitats are most likely not subsets of the larger pool of ECM fungi found in natural tundra, and they may represent a significant contribution to the overall diversity of ECM fungi in the Arctic. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={Changing climate is expected to alter precipitation patterns in the Arctic, with consequences for subsurface temperature and moisture conditions, community structure, and nutrient mobilization through microbial belowground processes. Here, we address the effect of increased snow depth on the variation in species richness and community structure of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungi. Soil samples were collected weekly from mid-July to mid-September in both control and deep snow plots. Richness of ECM fungi was lower, while saprotrophic fungi was higher in increased snow depth plots relative to controls. [Correction added on 23 September 2016 after first online publication: In the preceding sentence, the richness of ECM and saprotrophic fungi were wrongly interchanged and have been fixed in this current version.] ECM fungal richness was related to soil NO3-N, NH4-N, and K; and saprotrophic fungi to NO3-N and pH. Small but significant changes in the composition of saprotrophic fungi could be attributed to snow treatment and sampling time, but not so for the ECM fungi. Delayed snow melt did not influence the temporal variation in fungal communities between the treatments. Results suggest that some fungal species are favored, while others are disfavored resulting in their local extinction due to long-term changes in snow amount. Shifts in species composition of fungal functional groups are likely to affect nutrient cycling, ecosystem respiration, and stored permafrost carbon. © 2016 The Authors.

  abstract={Arctic ecosystems are under pressure from climate change and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. However, knowledge of the ecology of microbial communities and their responses to such challenges in Arctic tundra soil remain limited, despite the central role these organisms play for ecosystem functioning. We utilised a plot-scale experiment in High Arctic tundra on Svalbard to investigate short-term variation (9 days), following simulation of a N deposition event (4 kg N ha−1 yr−1), in the structure and abundance of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities between organic and mineral soil horizons. T-RFLP analysis showed significant differences between horizons in bacterial and archaeal community structure. Q-PCR analysis showed that fungal abundance did not differ significantly between soil horizons, whilst bacterial and archaeal abundance was significantly higher in mineral than in organic horizons, despite soil water and total C and N contents being significantly greater in the organic horizon. In the organic horizon, bacterial community structure and fungal abundance varied significantly over time. In the mineral horizon, there was significant variation over time in bacterial abundance, in archaeal community structure and in both fungal community structure and abundance. In contrast, N deposition did not lead to significant variation in either the structure or the abundance of microbial communities. This research demonstrates that microbial community structure and abundance can change rapidly (over only a few days) in Arctic tundra soils and also differently between soil horizons in response to different environmental drivers. Moreover, this variability in microbial community structure and abundance is soil horizon- and taxonomic domain-specific, highlighting the importance of investigating microbial communities across all soil horizons and over short periods of time. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={Arctic regions are experiencing the greatest rates of climate warming on the planet and marked changes have already been observed in terrestrial arctic ecosystems. While most studies have focused on the effects of warming on arctic vegetation and nutrient cycling, little is known about how belowground communities, such as fungi root-associated, respond to warming. Here, we investigate how long-term summer warming affects ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. We used Ion Torrent sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region to compare ECM fungal communities in plots with and without long-term experimental warming in both dry and moist tussock tundra. Cortinarius was the most OTU-rich genus in the moist tundra, while the most diverse genus in the dry tundra was Tomentella. On the diversity level, in the moist tundra we found significant differences in community composition, and a sharp decrease in the richness of ECM fungi due to warming. On the functional level, our results indicate that warming induces shifts in the extramatrical properties of the communities, where the species with medium-distance exploration type seem to be favored with potential implications for the mobilization of different nutrient pools in the soil. In the dry tundra, neither community richness nor community composition was significantly altered by warming, similar to what had been observed in ECM host plants. There was, however, a marginally significant increase in OTUs identified as ECM fungi with the medium-distance exploration type in the warmed plots. Linking our findings of decreasing richness with previous results of increasing ECM fungal biomass suggests that certain ECM species are favored by warming and may become more abundant, while many other species may go locally extinct due to direct or indirect effects of warming. Such compositional shifts in the community might affect nutrient cycling and soil organic C storage. © 2014 The Authors. Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Epilithic communities, especially those dominated by lichens, are able to withstand extreme environmental conditions but subsurface endolithic microhabitats provide more tolerant conditions. Endolithic microbial communities can be grouped into two main classes: eukaryotic communities (dominated by lichenized fungi and algae) and prokaryotic communities (dominated by cyanobacteria). Heterotrophic bacteria and non-lichenized algae and fungi (mainly black fungi) are also components of these communities. These lithobiontic microorganisms generally have effective mechanisms against freezing temperatures and desiccation. Extracellular polymeric substances play an important role not only in protecting microbial cells but also in community organization and in mitigating microenvironmental conditions. Antarctic lithobiontic communities are comprised of microbial consortia within which multiple interactions between the different biological and abiotic components are essential for microbial survival, whilst fossils and biomarkers provide evidence of earlier successful microbial life in Antarctic deserts. Finally, the uniqueness of the present lithobiont assemblages suggests they are the outcome of geographical isolation during the evolution of the continent and not merely the descendants of a subset of globally distributed taxa that have adapted to the extreme environmental conditions. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2014.},

  abstract={Melanin is a ubiquitous pigment with unique physicochemical properties. The resistance of melanized fungi to cosmic and terrestrial ionizing radiation suggests that melanin also plays a pivotal role in radioprotection. In this study, we compared the effects of densely-ionizing deuterons and sparsely-ionizing X-rays on two microscopic fungi capable of melanogenesis. We utilized the fast-growing pathogenic basiodiomycete forming an induced DOPA-melanin, Cryptococcus neoformans (CN); and the slow-growing environmental rock-inhabiting ascomycete synthesizing a constitutive DHN-melanin, Cryomyces antarcticus (CA); melanized and non-melanized counterparts were compared. CA was more resistant to deuterons than CN, and similar resistance was observed for X-rays. Melanin afforded protection against high-dose (1.5 kGy) deuterons for both CN and CA (p-values < 10−4). For X-rays (0.3 kGy), melanin protected CA (p-values < 10−4) and probably CN. Deuterons increased XTT activity in melanized strains of both species, while the activity in non-melanized cells remained stable or decreased. For ATP levels the reverse occurred: it decreased in melanized strains, but not in non-melanized ones, after deuteron exposure. For both XTT and ATP, which reflect the metabolic activity of the cells, larger and more statistically-significant differences as a function of melanization status occurred in CN. Our data show, for the first time, that melanin protected both fast-growing and slow-growing fungi from high doses of deuterons under physiological conditions. These observations may give clues for creating melanin-based radioprotectors. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

  abstract={The diversity of filamentous fungi that can grow at high ambient pH values (i.e., 8–11) remains largely understudied. Here we study 100 alkalitolerant and alkaliphilic isolates from the soils around the basin of soda lakes in Asia and Africa to assess the major evolutionary lineages and morphologies pertinent to the alkaliphilic trait in filamentous fungi. The Emericellopsis lineage (Hypocreales, Hypocreomycetidae), along with Plectosphaerellaceae (Hypocreomycetidae), Pleosporaceae (Dothideomycetes), Chaetomiaceae (Sordariomycetidae) families appeared to be overrepresented with strong alkalitolerants and effective alkaliphiles. In particular, Sodiomyces species (Plectosphaerellaceae), Acrostalagmus luteoalbus (Plectosphaerellaceae), Emericellopsis alkalina (Hypocreales), Thielavia sp. (Chaetomiaceae), and Alternaria sect. Soda (Pleosporaceae) grew best at high ambient pH. The pH tolerance of Chordomyces antarcticum, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus and some other species was largely affected by the presence of extra Na+ in the growth medium. Moderate alkalitolerants included Scopulariopsis members (Microascales), Fusarium, Cladosporium, and many asexual acremonium-like species from Bionectriaceae. Weak alkalitolerants were represented by sporadic isolates of Penicillium, Purpureocillium lilacinum, and Alternaria alternata species, with the growth optimum at neutral or acidic pH. Weak alkalitolerants develop loose dry chains of spores easily dispersed by air. Their presence at low frequency with the growth optimum at neutral or acidic pH leads us to treat them as transient species in the alkaline soils, as those are also ubiquitous saprobes in normal soils. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the alkaliphilic trait in filamentous fungi has evolved several times. Several lineages harboring strong alkalitolerants derived from the known marine-borne fungi (Emericellopsis, Alternaria sect. Phragmosporae), or fall within the fungi associated with halophytic grasses (Pleosporaceae). Soda soils contain a diversity of fungi that range from weak alkalitolerant to alkaliphilic, which in few cases is associated with darkly pigmented mycelium and formation of microsclerotia. The alkaliphilic trait is spread throughout the Ascomycota, and usually juxtaposes with slime-covered polyphyletic acremonium-, verticillium-, gliocladium-types of asexual morphology, hyphae aggregating in chords, and enclosed fruit bodies. © 2015, The Author(s).},

  abstract={The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica present extreme environmental challenges. Life is restricted to patchy occurrence of lichens, mosses and invertebrates, plus soil microbial communities. Fungi have been described in lichen symbioses but relatively little is known about the occurrence of free-living soil fungi in the Dry Valleys. A challenge in estimating fungal species richness has been the extent to which estimates based on either cultivation or environmental DNA reflect the active assemblage in cold-arid soils. Here, we describe analysis for inland Dry Valleys soil of environmental DNA and RNA (cDNA) to infer total and putative metabolically active assemblages, respectively, plus cultivation approaches using a variety of laboratory growth conditions. Environmental sequences indicated a highly restricted assemblage of just seven phylotypes that affiliated phylogenetically within two known genera, Helicodendron and Zalerion, plus previously unidentified fungal phylotypes. None of the commonly encountered molds and mitosporic genera recorded from maritime Antarctic locations were encountered. A striking difference was observed in the frequency of recovery for phylotypes between libraries. This suggests that both species richness and beta diversity estimates based on DNA libraries have the potential to misinform putatively active assemblages. Cultivation yielded a cold-tolerant Zalerion strain that affiliated with DNA and RNA library clones, and a psychrotrophic yeast (Debaryomyces hansenii), which was not detected using either culture-independent approach. © 2011 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Understanding the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in plant communities is hampered by a lack of knowledge about fungal diversity. DNA barcoding of the ectomycorrhizal fungal genus Cortinarius was used to compare fungal diversity in soil from four plant communities: (i) Nothofagus forest (where Cortinarius is common and diverse), (ii) Kunzea forest (where Cortinarius is present but with low diversity), (iii) a Pinus radiata plantation (Cortinarius is not thought to be present) and (iv) a sub-Antarctic island (where known ectomycorrhizal hosts are absent). PCR primers specific for the ITS region of Cortinarius species were developed. Specificity was tested in vitro and in silico against DNA from basidiocarps of Cortinarius and non-Cortinarius species. The primers were tested for their ability to amplify Cortinarius DNA in soil from forests of the three ectomycorrhizal forest communities and a range of soils from the ectomycorrhiza-free subantarctic Campbell Island. High diversity of Cortinarius was associated with soil of all three ectomycorrhizal communities, despite Cortinarius being previously unrecorded from Pinus. Soil from all three communities share some ectomycorrhizal fungi (including fungi shared between native and exotic hosts), having implications for community succession, introduction of exotic fungi and biodiversity assessment. No Cortinarius was detected from Campbell Island samples. The validated molecular protocol assessed species diversity in a rapid and cost effective way. Baseline biodiversity assessment based on DNA barcoding is more effective at detecting diversity than traditional methods, but requires careful consideration of the difference between ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity in soil versus root-tips. © 2012 Mushroom Research Foundation.},

  abstract={One of the least studied ecosystems on Earth is the plant-free zone found between the alpine tundra zone and the zone of permanent ice and snow. This unique ecosystem-type occurs in all of the major mountain ranges on Earth and is especially widespread in the Andes and Himalayas. Here we describe recent molecular-phylogenetic studies of the fungi that inhabit these apparently barren soils. Sites that receive significant amounts of snowfall (in the Himalayas, Rocky and Andes ranges) are dominated by unique clades of zoosporic fungi (especially the Spizellomycetales), which likely use the saturated soil conditions during snow melt to complete their life cycles and then remain dormant for most of the year during periods of extreme cold and dryness. In more extreme sites that have very sporadic and shallow snow packs, such as the upper slopes of Llullaillaco Volcano (el. 6 741 m above sea level) on the Chilean-Argentinian border, fungal communities show very little diversity and are dominated by clades of yeasts related to the Antarctic endolithic yeasts in the Filobasidiales group. The other major group found on Llullaillaco form a clade most closely affiliated with the Dothideomycetes. Overall, our phylogenetic approach and spatially explicit sampling scheme allow us to formulate new hypotheses about the ecological functioning of fungi that inhabit critically endangered high elevation ecosystems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

Fungal diversity was determined by conventional microbiological techniques combined with a culture-independent method based on the analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) sequences in total DNA of the samples. The study revealed a rather low fungal population density in permafrost, although the diversity found was appreciable, representing more than 26 genera. Comparison of the data obtained by different techniques showed that the culture-independent method enabled the detection of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous fungi not found by culturing.

Among the species recovered, an isolate of Leucosporidium scottii, designated At17, was identified as a good biocontrol agent for blue and gray mold of two apple cultivars. The selected isolate produced soluble and volatile antifungal substances that were inhibitory to apple pathogens. Siderophore production was also demonstrated, but it did not appear to play a role in pathogen inhibition. The selected yeast had the capacity to form a biofilm when grown in apple juice, which is considered an important attribute of postharvest antagonists to successfully colonize wounds and intact fruit surfaces. At17 was resistant to commonly used postharvest fungicides, so application of a combination of low-dose fungicide along with the biocontrol agent could be used as an integrated management practice. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

Ascomycetous yeasts have rarely been reported from extremely cold natural environments, even though they are known contaminants of frozen foods. Using media with low water activity, we have isolated various yeast species from the subglacial ice of four glaciers from the coastal Arctic environment of Kongsfjorden, Spitzbergen, including Debaryomyces hansenii and Pichia guillermondii, with counts reaching 104 CFU L-1. Together with the basidiomycetes Cryptococcus liquefaciens and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, these yeasts represent the stable core of the subglacial yeast communities. Other glacial ascomycetous species isolated included Candida parapsilosis and a putative new species that resembles Candida pseudorugosa. The archiascomycete Protomyces inouyei has seldom been detected anywhere in the world but was here recovered from ice in a glacier cave. The glacier meltwater contained only D. hansenii, whereas the seawater contained D. hansenii, Debaryomyces maramus, Pichia guilliermondii, what appears to represent a novel species resembling Candida galli and Metschnikowia bicuspidata. Only P. guilliermondii was isolated from sea ice, while snow/ice in the fjord tidal zone included C. parapsilosis, D. hansenii, P. guilliermondii and Metschnikowia zobellii.

  abstract={Various microbial groups are well known to produce a range of extracellular enzymes and other secondary metabolites. However, the occurrence and importance of investment in such activities have received relatively limited attention in studies of Antarctic soil microbiota. In order to examine extracellular enzyme production in this chronically low-temperature environment, fungi were isolated from ornithogenic, pristine and human-impacted soils collected from the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica during the austral summer in February 2007. Twenty-eight isolates of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant fungi were obtained and screened at a culture temperature of 4°C for activity of extracellular hydrolase enzymes (amylase, cellulase, protease), using R2A agar plates supplemented with (a) starch for amylase activity, (b) carboxymethyl cellulose and trypan blue for cellulase activity or (c) skim milk for protease activity. Sixteen isolates showed activity for amylase, 23 for cellulase and 21 for protease. One isolate showed significant activity across all three enzyme types, and a further 10 isolates showed significant activity for at least two of the enzymes. No clear associations were apparent between the fungal taxa isolated and the type of source soil, or in the balance of production of different extracellular enzymes between the different soil habitats sampled. Investment in extracellular enzyme production is clearly an important element of the survival strategy of these fungi in maritime Antarctic soils. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={The McMurdo Dry Valleys region of eastern Antarctica is a cold desert that presents extreme challenges to life. Hypolithic microbial colonisation of the subsoil surfaces of translucent quartz rocks represent a significant source of terrestrial biomass and productivity in this region. Previous studies have described hypoliths as dominated by cyanobacteria. However, hypoliths that occur in the lower Dry Valleys such as the Miers, Garwood and Marshall Valleys are unusual as they are not necessarily cyanobacteria-dominated. These hypoliths support significant eukaryal colonisation by fungi and mosses in addition to cyanobacteria-dominated bacterial assemblages and so have considerable ecological value in this barren landscape. Here, we characterise these novel hypoliths by analysis of environmental rRNA gene sequences. The hypolithic community was demonstrated to be distinct from the surrounding soil and non-translucent rocks. Hypoliths supported cyanobacterial signatures from the Oscillatoriales and Nostocales. Other heterotrophic bacterial signatures were also recovered, and these were phylogenetically diverse and spanned 8 other bacterial phyla. Archaeal phylotypes recovered were phylogenetically affiliated with the large group of unclassified, uncultured Crenarcheota. Eukaryal phylotypes indicated that free-living ascomycetous fungi, chlorophytes and mosses (Bryum sp.) were all supported by these hypoliths, and these are thought to be responsible for the extensive eukaryotic biomass that develops around quartz rocks. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

In order to investigate the potential DNA damage and their response after UV-B exposition, two strains of Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungi, Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 534 and Cryomyces minteri CCFEE 5187, were irradiated at different UV-B doses. Since conventional methods cannot be applied to these organisms, the effect on the genome was assessed by RAPD and rDNA amplification PCR based assays; the results were compared with the responses of Saccharomyces pastorianus DBVPG 6283 treated with the same conditions. Results showed that template activity was drastically inhibited in S. pastorianus after irradiation. Dramatic changes in the RAPD profiles showed after 30. min of exposure while the rDNA amplification of SSU, LSU, and ITS portions failed after 30, 60, and 90. min of exposure respectively. No alteration was detected in the templates of the Antarctic strains where both RAPD profiles and rDNA PCR amplifications were unaffected even after 240. min of exposure. The electroferograms of the rDNA portions of Cryomyces strains were perfectly readable and conserved whilst the analyses revealed a marked alteration in S. pastorianus confirming the high resistance of the Antarctic strains to UV-B exposure. © 2011 British Mycological Society.},

In the present study, we evaluated the presence and distribution of cultivable fungi in marine core sediments obtained from 100, 500, 700 and 1,100 m below the Antarctic Ocean surface. Fifty-two fungal isolates were identified as Penicillium solitum by their physiological and morphological characteristics, and the identity of 12 representative isolates was further confirmed by sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and β-tubulin genes. P. solitum displayed high sequence similarity to Penicillium taxa that have been described from other marine habitats. Conidial germination of P. solitum occurred at low temperatures and high salinities. In addition, P. solitum displayed extracellular amylasic and esterasic activities. The isolation of P. solitum from marine sediments in Antarctica and its survival at low temperatures and high salt concentrations suggest that it is adapted to the cold and halophilic environment of the Antarctic oceans. Because P. solitum produces extracellular enzymes, it is an interesting eukaryotic model for the study of structure-function relationships during enzymatic biocatalysis and biotransformation under extreme conditions. Marine sediments from Antarctica may represent a unique source for obtaining extremophilic fungi. New studies using different culture media, temperatures ranges and pressure conditions as well as metagenomic techniques can assist in understanding the extremophilic fungal communities in marine sediments across the Antarctic Ocean. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

  abstract={The α-subunit of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (PAH-RHD α) coding genes from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were characterized in diesel oil-contaminated and pristine soils from King George Island in Maritime Antarctica. PCR, cloning and sequencing methodologies were used, and nucleotide and deduced amino acids sequences were further analyzed using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) tools. Few PAH-RHD α sequences sharing high identities with NagAc from Ralstonia sp. U2 and with NahAc from Comamonas testosteroni strain H were found in pristine soil. In addition, PAH-RHD α sharing 44-100% identity with dioxygenases described within the Gram-negative Pseudomonas, Polaromonas, Sphingomonas, Acidovorax and Burkholderia genera and Gram-positive Mycobacterium, Gordonia, Terrabacter, Nocardioides and Bacillus genera were found in contaminated soils adjacent to the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz. To our knowledge, the presence of PAH-RHD α coding genes from Gram-positive PAH-degrading bacteria has never been evidenced in Antarctic soils. Beta-diversity comparison analysis showed a different distribution of Gram-negative PAH-degrading bacteria among the Antarctic contaminated sites.

  abstract={Tundra and taiga ecosystems comprise nearly 40 % of the terrestrial landscapes of Canada. These permafrost ecosystems have supported humans for more than 4500 years, and are currently home to ca. 115,000 people, the majority of whom are First Nations, Inuit and Métis. The responses of these ecosystems to the regional warming over the past 30-50 years were the focus of four Canadian IPY projects. Northern residents and researchers reported changes in climate and weather patterns and noted shifts in vegetation and other environmental variables. In forest-tundra areas tree growth and reproductive effort correlated with temperature, but seedling establishment was often hindered by other factors resulting in site-specific responses. Increased shrub cover has occurred in sites across the Arctic at the plot and landscape scale, and this was supported by results from experimental warming. Experimental warming increased vegetation cover and nutrient availability in most tundra soils; however, resistance to warming was also found. Soil microbial diversity in tundra was no different than in other biomes, although there were shifts in mycorrhizal diversity in warming experiments. All sites measured were sinks for carbon during the growing season, with expected seasonal and latitudinal patterns. Modeled responses of a mesic tundra system to climate change showed that the sink status will likely continue for the next 50-100 years, after which these tundra systems will likely become a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. These IPY studies were the first comprehensive assessment of the state and change in Canadian northern terrestrial ecosystems and showed that the inherent variability in these systems is reflected in their site-specific responses to changes in climate. They also showed the importance of using local traditional knowledge and science, and provided extensive data sets, sites and researchers needed to study and manage the inevitable changes in the Canadian North. © 2012 The Author(s).},

  abstract={Given that changes in the patterns of vegetation and size of carbon (C) pools in the Arctic are likely to be profound by the end of this century, it is necessary to characterise the identity and ecological groupings, in terms of temperature response and C substrate utilisation, of saprotrophic (decomposer) fungi in organic matter in Arctic soils. Thus, the aims of this study were: (1) to identify the fungi isolated from standing-dead material of Schistidium apocarpum, as an example of a High Arctic moss, (2) to determine mycelial extension rates of these fungi at a range of temperatures (4, 10 and 25 °C), and (3) to characterise the functional potential, defined by C substrate utilisation at 6 °C, of fungal taxa. Fungi were isolated at 4 °C from standing-dead material of S. apocarpum from an area of polar semi-desert (79 degrees N), close to Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, in the High Arctic. From a collection of 662 isolates, 43 pure cultures were identified by DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing. Phoma sclerotioides, previously known as a temperate snow mould, was isolated most frequently. The ecology of fifteen fungal isolates was characterised in detail. In terms of temperature response, two groups were apparent, one of truly psychrophilic/psychrotrophic fungi and one of more mesophilic fungi which were generally less frequently isolated. In terms of carbon substrate utilisation in semi-defined solid media, most fungi could utilise a variety of carbon substrates (degradation of casein, cellulose and starch was widespread), except for tannic acid (degraded by only two of the five P. sclerotioides isolates and Scytalidium lignicola) and lignin and chitin (not decomposed by any isolate). The majority of isolates had been recorded previously from polar environments and/or as being able to survive at low temperatures. Fungi in tundra ecosystems, therefore, have significant potential to mineralise C at temperatures below 10 °C. A better understanding of the ecology of these fungi will allow us to improve predictions of C dynamics in arctic biomes in the future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract={To understand fully the risk of biological invasions, it is necessary to quantify propagule pressure along all introduction pathways. In the Antarctic region, importation of fresh produce is a potentially high risk, but as yet unquantified pathway. To address this knowledge gap, >11,250 fruit and vegetables sent to nine research stations in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands, were examined for associated soil, invertebrates and microbial decomposition. Fifty-one food types were sourced from c. 130 locations dispersed across all six of the Earth's inhabited continents. On average, 12% of food items had soil on their surface, 28% showed microbial infection resulting in rot and more than 56 invertebrates were recorded, mainly from leafy produce. Approximately 30% of identified fungi sampled from infected foods were not recorded previously from within the Antarctic region, although this may reflect limited knowledge of Antarctic fungal diversity. The number of non-native flying invertebrates caught within the Rothera Research Station food storage area was linked closely with the level of fresh food resupply by ship and aircraft. We conclude by presenting practical biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of non-native species introductions to Antarctica associated with fresh foods. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract={The ecology of tundra terrestrial environments has gained increasing attention due to potential major changes resulting from global warming and climate change. However, the composition of terrestrial microbial communities and their role in the biogeochemical carbon cycle are less well studied. This is the first report of the C-biomass of bacteria, fungi, and representative protozoa (heterotrophic nanoflagellates, naked amoebae, and testate amoebae) in Alaskan tundra soil samples, and the effects of glucose solution enrichment in laboratory studies simulating release of soluble organic compounds as may occur during permafrost melt and increased plant root exudates due to global warming. The data for three moss-rich surface samples, two in spring and one in summer (2011), are reported for C-supplemented (8,000 μg glucose-C) and non-supplemented treatments in laboratory culture. Seven days after supplementation, fungal C-biomass in the glucose-treated and untreated samples were similar in the range of 5 to 11 mg g-1 soil dry weight, the highest values in the summer samples. The bacterial C-biomass was the next highest in the range of 20 to 120 μg g-1 soil dry weight, followed by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (2 to 14 μg g-1 soil dry weight). The naked amoebae (0.13 to 0.94 μg C g-1 soil dry weight) and testate amoebae (2 to 20 ng C g-1 soil dry weight) contributed the least C-biomass. All of the bacterial and protozoan treatments showed increased biomass with glucose supplementation. Based on size, and C-biomass estimates, the phagotrophic protozoa appear to be organized in a classical bacterial-based trophic hierarchy (i.e. bacteria - nanoflagellates - naked amoebae - testate amoebae, in ascending order). Correlations of the C-biomass of bacteria to each of the protozoa, provided further evidence of a trophic pyramid; bacteria vs. nanoflagellates (r = -0.986), indicating top-down control by predatory flagellates, bacteria vs. naked amoebae (r = -0.361) and bacteria vs. testate amoebae (r = -0.131), each of decreasing magnitude as would be predicted for higher level consumers. Estimates of bacterial predation indicated strong predatory pressures on bacteria by the protozoa, greater with C-supplementation compared to the non-supplemented treatments.},

  abstract={Soil microorganisms are critical to carbon and nutrient fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the annual pattern of soil microbial community structure and how it corresponds to soil nutrient availability and plant production is a fundamental first step towards being able to predict impacts of environmental change on ecosystem functioning. We investigated the composition, structure and nutrient stoichiometry of the soil microbial community in mesic arctic tundra on 9 sample dates in 6 months from winter to fall using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), epifluorescent microscopy and chloroform-fumigation-extraction (CFE). PLFA analysis indicates that the winter microbial community was fungal-dominated, cold-adapted and associated with high C, N and P in the soil solution and microbial biomass. The microscopy data suggest that both bacteria and fungi were active and growing in soils between-5°C and 0°C. A significant shift occurred in the PLFA data, qPCR patterns, microscopy and microbial biogeochemistry after the thaw period, resulting in a distinct community that persisted through our spring, summer and fall sample dates, despite large changes in plant productivity. This shift was characterised by increasing relative abundances of certain bacteria (especially Gram+ves) as well as a decline in fungal biomass, and corresponded with decreasing C, N and P in the soil solution. The summer period of low substrate availability (plant-microbe competition) was associated with microbial indicators of nutritional stress. Overall, our results indicate that tundra microbial communities are clearly differentiated according to the changes in soil nutrient status and environmental conditions that occur between winter and post-thaw, and that those changes reflect functionally important adaptations to those conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract={Endophytic fungi associated with three bryophyte species in the Fildes Region, King George Island, maritime Antarctica, that is, the liverwort Barbilophozia hatcheri, the mosses Chorisodontium aciphyllum and Sanionia uncinata, were studied by culture-dependent method. A total of 128 endophytic fungi were isolated from 1329 tissue segments of 14 samples. The colonization rate of endophytic fungi in three bryophytes species were 12.3%, 12.1%, and 8.7%, respectively. These isolates were identified to 21 taxa, with 15 Ascomycota, 5 Basidiomycota, and 1 unidentified fungus, based on morphological characteristics and sequence analyses of ITS region and D1/D2 domain. The dominant fungal endophyte was Hyaloscyphaceae sp. in B. hatcheri, Rhizoscyphus sp. in C. aciphyllum, and one unidentified fungus in S. uncinata; and their relative frequencies were 33.3%, 32.1%, and 80.0%, respectively. Furthermore, different Shannon-Weiner diversity indices (0.91-1.99) for endophytic fungi and low endophytic fungal composition similarities (0.19-0.40) were found in three bryophyte species. Growth temperature tests indicated that 21 taxa belong to psychrophiles (9), psychrotrophs (11), and mesophile (1). The results herein demonstrate that the Antarctic bryophytes are an interesting source of fungal endophytes and the endophytic fungal composition is different among the bryophyte species, and suggest that these fungal endophytes are adapted to cold stress in Antarctica.

  abstract={The methanolysis of soybean oil to produce a fatty acid methyl ester (ME, i.e., biodiesel fuel) was catalyzed by lipase-producing filamentous fungi immobilized on biomass support particles (BSPs) as a whole-cell biocatalyst in the presence of ionic liquids. We used four types of whole-cell biocatalysts: wild-type Rhizopus oryzae producing triacylglycerol lipase (w-ROL), recombinant Aspergillus oryzae expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL), Candida antarctica lipase B (r-CALB), and mono- and diacylglycerol lipase from A. oryzae (r-mdlB). w-ROL gave the high yield of fatty acid methyl ester (ME) in ionic liquid [Emim][BF4] or [Bmim][BF4] biphasic systems following a 24 h reaction. While lipases are known to be severely deactivated by an excess amount of methanol (e.g. 1.5 Mequiv. of methanol against oil) in a conventional system, methanolysis successfully proceeded even with a methanol/oil ratio of 4 in the ionic liquid biphasic system, where the ionic liquids would work as a reservoir of methanol to suppress the enzyme deactivation. When only w-ROL was used as a biocatalyst for methanolysis, unreacted mono-glyceride remained due to the 1,3-positional specificity of R. oryzae lipase. High ME conversion was attained by the combined use of two types of whole-cell biocatalysts, w-ROL and r-mdlB. In a stability test, the activity of w-ROL was reduced to one-third of its original value after incubation in [Bmim][BF4] for 72 h. The stability of w-ROL in [Bmim][BF4] was greatly enhanced by cross-linking the biocatalyst with glutaraldehyde. The present study demonstrated that ionic liquids are promising candidates for use as the second solvent in biodiesel fuel production by whole-cell biocatalysts. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The compounds were purified by solvent extraction, silica gel column chromatography and preparative TLC consecutively. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by NMR experiments and mass spectrometric investigations. These compounds showed antimicrobial activity against important Grampositive bacteria and fungi.

  abstract={Uptake of nitrogen (N) via root-mycorrhizal associations accounts for a significant portion of total N supply to many vascular plants. Using stable isotope ratios (δ15N) and the mass balance among N pools of plants, fungal tissues, and soils, a number of efforts have been made in recent years to quantify the flux of N from mycorrhizal fungi to host plants. Current estimates of this flux for arctic tundra ecosystems rely on the untested assumption that the δ15N of labile organic N taken up by the fungi is approximately the same as the δ15N of bulk soil. We report here hydrolysable amino acids are more depleted in 15N relative to hydrolysable ammonium and amino sugars in arctic tundra soils near Toolik Lake, Alaska, USA. We demonstrate, using a case study, that recognizing the depletion in 15N for hydrolysable amino acids (δ15N = -5. 6‰ on average) would alter recent estimates of N flux between mycorrhizal fungi and host plants in an arctic tundra ecosystem. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

  abstract={A wide range of microbial taxa are active in hydrocarbon-contaminated Arctic soils, and many are capable of hydrocarbon metabolism. The most effective hydrocarbon degraders may not naturally dominate following contamination events, so shifts in microbial abundance could potentially increase hydrocarbon biodegradation. In this study, we contaminated an Arctic soil with diesel and used gentamicin and vancomycin to inhibit distinct portions of the microbial community. We measured diesel loss using gas chromatography, bacterial and fungal abundance with qPCR, and assessed bacterial diversity and community composition through Ion Torrent sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The combined addition of both antibiotics increased diesel biodegradation significantly relative to the no-antibiotic treatment, despite reduced bacterial and fungal abundance; however, this effect was not observed when nutrients were also added. All treatments produced unique bacterial communities, and both Xanthomonadaceae and Micrococcineae were dominant in the dual antibiotic treatment. The bacterial communities resulting from dual gentamicin and vancomycin addition were similar both with and without nutrients, although nutrient addition produced a much larger fungal population, which may partly explain the differences in biodegradation between these two treatments. These results suggest that the most efficient hydrocarbon-degrading community may not always be promoted naturally in contaminated soils. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2013.},

  abstract={In arctic tundra soil N is highly limiting, N mineralization is slow and organic N greatly exceeds inorganic N. We studied the effects of fungistatics (azoxystrobin [Quadris®] or propiconazole [Tilt®]) on the fungi isolated from ericaceous plant roots in vitro. In addition to testing the phytotoxicity of the two fungistatics we also tested their effects on growth and nitrogen uptake of an ericaceous plant (Vaccinium uliginosum) in a closed Petri plate system without root-associated fungi. Finally, to evaluate the fungistatic effects in an in vivo experiment we applied fungistatics and nitrogen isotopes to intact tundra soil cores from Toolik Lake, Alaska, and examined the ammonium-N and glycine-N use by Vaccinium vitisidaea with and without fungistatics. The experiments on fungal pure cultures showed that Tilt® was more effective in reducing fungal colony growth in vitro than Quadris®, which was highly variable among the fungal strains. Laboratory experiments aiming to test the fungistatic effects on plant performance in vitro showed that neither Quadris® nor Tilt® affected V. uliginosum growth or N uptake. In this experiment V. uliginosum assimilated more than an order of magnitude more ammonium-N than glycine-N. The intact tundra core experiment provided contrasting results. After 10 wk of fungistatic application in the growth chamber V. vitis-idaea leaf %N was 10% lower and the amount of leaf 15N acquired was reduced from labeled ammonium (33%) and glycine (40%) during the 4 d isotope treatment. In contrast to the in vitro experiment leaf 15N assimilation from glycine was three times higher than from 15NH4 in the treatments that received no-fungistatics. We conclude that the function of the fungal communities is essential to the acquisition of N from organic sources and speculate that N acquisition from inorganic sources is mainly inhibited by competition with complex soil microbial communities. © 2010 by The Mycological Society of America.},

Thirty-five percent of culturable fungi were of the genus Mrakia. Eighteen isolates from eight genera were selected and tested for both antifreeze activity and capacity for growth under temperatures ranging from -1 to 25 °C. Rhodotorula sp. NHT-2 possessed a high degree of sequence homology with R. gracialis, while Leucosporidium sp. BSS-1 possessed a high degree of sequence homology with Leu. antarcticum (Glaciozyma antarctica), and these two isolates demonstrated antifreeze activity. All isolates examined were capable of growth at -1 °C. Mrakia spp., while capable of growth at -1 °C, did not demonstrate any antifreeze activity and exhibited only limited secretion of extracellular polysaccharides.

We examined the diversity and species composition of microfungi associated with withering woody shoots of saplings of Salix spp. (willows) transplanted and in ground contact near Syowa Station, East Antarctica for more than 40 years. The willow saplings originated from Hokkaido, Northern Japan, and were experimentally transplanted in 1967-1968, but died within a few years. Dead willow shoots, unbranched and standing on bare ground for approximately 50 years, were used for the isolation of fungi with the surface disinfection method. A total of 43 isolates were retrieved from 32 (78 %) of the 41 shoots tested. The fungal isolates were classified into 18 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) based on the similarity of rDNA ITS sequences at the 97 % criterion. Leotiomycetes was the most common class in terms of the number of isolates and MOTUs, followed by Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes. Molecular phylogenetic affinities suggested that the closest relatives of the MOTUs were saprobic and root-associated fungi.

  abstract={Polar willow (Salix polaris Wahlenb.), a mycorrhizal dwarf shrub, colonizes recently deglaciated areas in the High Arctic, Svalbard. To clarify successional changes in ECM fungi associated with S. polaris after glacier retreat, we examined the diversity and density of ECM fungi in culture and field conditions. Plant and soil samples were collected from three sites of different successional stages in the deglaciated area of Austre Brøggerbreen, near Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. The successional stages were early stage with newly exposed bare ground (site I), transient stage with scattered colonization of Salix (sites IIa and IIb), and late stage with well-developed vegetation (site III). No ECM colonization on Salix was observed in soils collected from bare ground in early and transient stages (sites I and IIa). However, most Salix individuals showed ECM colonization in soils collected from sites close to Salix colonies in transient and late stages (sites IIb and III). Based on molecular analyses and operational taxonomic unit (OTU: >95% ITS sequence similarity) delimitations, we identified 15 OTUs/species in eight genera. The dominant OTU/species of ECM fungi identified in the transient and late stages was Geopora sp. 1 and Cenococcum sp. 1, respectively. In the culture experiment, ECM diversity was greater in late stage (eight OTUs/species) than in transient stage (three OTUs/species). This pattern was consistent with field observations, i. e., late-stage sites contained more OTUs/species of ECM fungi. These results indicate that species diversity of ECM fungi increases and the dominant species changes with the progress of succession after glacier retreat in the High Arctic. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Amplified Arctic warming could thaw 25% of the permafrost area by 2100, exposing vast amounts of currently fixed organic carbon to microbially mediated decomposition and release of greenhouse gasses through soil organic matter (SOM) respiration. We performed time-series incubation experiments with Holocene permafrost soils at 4°C for up to 11 days to determine changes in exoenzyme activities (EEAs) (i.e. phosphatase, β-glucosidase, aminopeptidase) as a measure for the bioavailability of SOM in response to permafrost thaw. We also profiled SSU rRNA transcripts to follow the qualitative and quantitative changes in viable prokaryotes and eukaryotes during incubation. EEA, amount of rRNA transcripts and microbial community structures differed substantially between the various soil intervals in response to thaw: after 11 days of incubation, the active layer became slightly depleted in C and P and harboured bacterial phyla indicative of more oligotrophic conditions (Acidobacteria). A fast response in phosphatase and β-glucosidase upon thaw, and a predominance of active copiotrophic Bacteroidetes, showed that the upper permafrost plate serves as storage of easily degradable carbon derived from the overlying thawed active layer during summer. EEA profiles and microbial community dynamics furthermore suggest that the deeper and older permafrost intervals mainly contain recalcitrant SOM, and that extracellular soil-bound exoenzymes play a role in the initial cleavage of biopolymers, which could kick-start microbial growth upon thaw. Basidiomycetous fungi and Candidate Subdivision OP5 bacteria were the first to respond in freshly thawed deeper permafrost intervals, and might play an important role in the decomposition of recalcitrant SOM to release more labile substrates to support the major bacterial phyla (β-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes), which predominated thereafter. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract={Selection pressure induced by simultaneously occurring environmental threats is a major evolutionary driver for organisms in terrestrial, as well as in aquatic ecosystems. For example, protection against ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and predation include both morphological and behavioral components. Here we address those selective pressures on zooplankton by performing a latitudinal monitoring, combined with mechanistic experiments in the Antarctic Southern Ocean, where the UVR-threat is extremely high. We assessed vertical distributions of zooplankton along the Antarctic coast showing that animals were most abundant at 20-80 m and tended to avoid the surface at sites with clear water. UVR-threat disappeared at between 9 and 15 m at sites with low and high water transparency, respectively. Light levels were, however, sufficient for visual fish predation down to approximately 19 and 37 m, respectively. The few zooplankton that were present in surface waters had high levels of non-pigmented UVR-protective compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) compared to deeper dwelling zooplankton. Overall they had low levels of red pigmented UVR-protective compounds (carotenoids), suggesting high predation on pigmented individuals. In a complementary laboratory study we showed that levels of UVR-protective compounds increased considerably when zooplankton were exposed to UVR in the absence of predator cues. The recently developed transparency-regulator hypothesis predicts that UVR avoidance is an important driver to diel vertical migration in transparent waters, such as in Antarctica. We, however, conclude that copepods resided well below the level where UVR had diminished to very low levels and that predator avoidance or food availability are more likely drivers of zooplankton vertical depth distribution in transparent marine systems. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract={Cryoconite holes have biogeochemical, ecological and biotechnological importance. This communication presents results on culturable psychrophilic yeast and filamentous fungi from cryoconite holes at Midre Lovénbreen glacier. The identification of these microbes was achieved through conventional and DNA sequencing techniques. Effect of temperature, salt and media on growth of the cultures was studied. Measurements on the bioavailability of nutrients and trace metals were made through different methods including ICPMS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry). Colony forming unit (CFU) per gram of sediment sample was calculated to be about 7 × 10 3-1.4 × 10 4 and 4 × 10 3-1.2 × 10 4 of yeast and filamentous fungi, respectively. Based on morphology and sequence data, these were identified as Cryptococcus gilvescens, Mrakia sp., Rhodotorula sp., Phialophora alba and Articulospora tetracladia. Amongst these, Phialophora alba, Cryptococcus gilvescens and Mrakia sp. zhenx-1 are reported for the first time from Svalbard Arctic, while Rhodotorula sp. (95% gene similarity) is a new species, yet to be described. Rhodotorula sp. expressed high amylase, while Cryptococcus gilvescens showed high lipase activity. Mrakia sp. showed phosphate solubilization between 4 and 15°C, which is a first record. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in substantial amounts in the sediments. Filamentous fungi and yeast in the cryoconite holes drive the process of organic macromolecule degradation through cold-adapted enzyme secretion, thereby assisting in nutrient cycling in these subglacial environments. Further, these cold-adapted enzymes may provide an opportunity for the prospect of biotechnology in Arctic. This is the first report on mycological investigation into cryoconite holes from Midre Lovénbreen glacier. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Plants in arctic and alpine environments possess higher nitrogen concentrations (%N) than plants in warmer environments. High nitrogen content is considered an adaptation to nutrient poor and cold environments. Prior studies demonstrate that %N increases in plants with increasing altitude. Since fungal growth should also be limited by harsh environmental conditions that increase with altitude, it was hypothesized that fungi growing at higher altitudes would have higher %N than fungi at lower altitudes. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed the total nitrogen concentrations in basidiocarps of two genera of abundant ectomycorrhizal fungi, Leccinum and Lactarius, growing at different altitudes (85 - 800 m a.s.l.) in several localities of the Fennoscandian subarctic. Contrary to our expectations, results show that nitrogen concentration in Leccinum decreases with increasing altitude, whereas there was no change for Lactarius. Thus results for fungi were decoupled from that of the associated plants. The %N in Leccinum basidiocarps was somewhat higher than that in Lactarius species (4.55 ± 1.15 and 3.50 ± 0.58, respectively). Future studies should include examination of species, host, and soil effects on %N, as well as isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in basidiocarps, soil, and root material. © 2010 Pacific Northwest Fungi Project.},

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplifications of the alkane monooxygenase AlkB-coding genes, followed by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses, revealed the widespread presence and complex diversity of alkane-utilizing bacteria in these soils.

Sequencing of 20 DGGE bands revealed the presence in Antarctic soils of alkane monooxygenases with low similarity (61-91%) compared to those previously described in Gram-positive bacteria, such as Mycobacterium, Gordonia, Rhodococcus and Aeromicrobium.

  abstract={Antarctica offers a range of extreme climatic conditions, such as low temperatures, high solar radiation and low nutrient availability, and constitutes one of the harshest environments on Earth. Despite that, it has been successfully colonized by 'cold-loving' fungi, which play a key role in decomposition cycles in cold ecosystems. However, knowledge about the ecological role of yeasts in nutrient or organic matter recycling/mineralization remains highly fragmentary. The aim of this work was to study the yeast microbiota in samples collected on 25 de Mayo/King George Island regarding the scope of their ability to degrade polyphenolic substrates such as lignin and azo dyes. Sixty-one yeast isolates were obtained from 37 samples, including soil, rocks, wood and bones. Molecular analyses based on rDNA sequences revealed that 35 yeasts could be identified at the species level and could be classified in the genera Leucosporidiella, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus, Bullera and Candida. Cryptococcus victoriae was by far the most ubiquitous species. In total, 33% of the yeast isolates examined showed significant activity for dye decolorization, 25% for laccase activity and 38% for ligninolytic activity. Eleven yeasts did not show positive activity in any of the assays performed and no isolates showed positive activity across all tested substrates. A high diversity of yeasts were isolated in this work, possibly including undescribed species and conspicuous Antarctic yeasts, most of them belonging to oligotrophic, slow-growing and metabolically diverse basidiomycetous genera. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract={Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems currently include very few non-native species, due to the continent's extreme isolation from other landmasses. However, the indigenous biota is vulnerable to human-mediated introductions of non-native species. In December 2005, four construction vehicles were imported by contractors to the British Antarctic Survey's (BAS) Rothera Research Station (Antarctic Peninsula) from the Falkland Islands and South Georgia (South Atlantic) on board RRS James Clark Ross. The vehicles were contaminated with >132 kg of non-Antarctic soil that contained viable non-native angiosperms, bryophytes, micro-invertebrates, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, and c. 40,000 seeds and numerous moss propagules. The incident was a significant contravention of BAS operating procedures, the UK Antarctic Act (1994) and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1998), which all prohibit the introduction of non-native species to Antarctica without an appropriate permit. The introduction of this diverse range of species poses a significant threat to local biodiversity should any of the species become established, particularly as the biota of sub-Antarctic South Georgia is likely to include many species with appropriate pre-adaptations facilitating the colonisation of more extreme Antarctic environments. Once the incident was discovered, the imported soil was removed immediately from Antarctica and destroyed. Vehicle cleaning and transportation guidelines have been revised to enhance the biosecurity of BAS operations, and to minimise the risk of similar incidents occurring. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

After saturation of P. chrysogenum A096 culture supernatant with ammonium sulfate and ion exchange chromatography, a novel antifungal protein (Pc-Arctin) was purified and identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS). The gene encoding for Pc-Arctin consisting of 195 nucleotides was cloned from P. chrysogenum A096 to confirm the mass spectrometry result. Pc-Arctin displays antifungal activity against Paecilomyces variotii, Alternaria longipes, and Trichoderma viride at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 24, 48, and 192 ng/disc, respectively. Pc-Arctin was most sensitive to proteinase K and then to trypsin but insensitive to papain. Pc-Arctin possesses high thermostability and cannot be antagonized by common surfactants, except for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Divalent ions, such as Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+, inhibited the antifungal activity of Pc-Arctin. Hemagglutination assays showed that Pc-Arctin had no hemagglutinating or hemolytic activity against red blood cells (RBC) from rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs. Therefore, Pc-Arctin from Arctic P. chrysogenum may represent a novel antifungal protein with potential for application in controlling plant pathogenic fungal infection. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

The motivation of the research was initially to identify potential fungal causes of degradation of the historic huts and artifacts. The research was extended to study fungal presence at pristine sites for comparison purposes and to consider the role of fungi in the respective ecosystems. We employed classical microbiology for isolation of viable organisms, and culture-independent DNA analyses. The research provided baseline data on microbial biodiversity. Principal findings were that there is significant overlap of the yeasts and filamentous fungi isolated from the historic sites, soil, and historic-introduced materials (i. e., wood, foodstuffs) and isolated from environmental samples in pristine locations. Aerial spore monitoring confirmed that winter spore counts were high and, in some cases, similar to those found in summer. Microbial diversity varied between the three Ross Island historic sites, and one historic site showed noticeably higher diversity, which led to the conclusion that this is a variable that should not be generalized. Cultured fungi were cold active, and the broader scientific significance of this finding was that climate change (warming) may not adversely affect these fungal species unless they were out-competed by new arrivals or unfavorable changes in ecosystem domination occur. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Extremely acidic soils (pH < 3) harbour mycobiota that are different from less acidic habitats and are dominated by a small number of fungal species. During investigation of the mycobiota of highly acidic soils in the Czech Republic and Iceland, a group of melanised fungal isolates was obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS region, SSU, LSU), the isolates were accommodated by three phylogenetic lineages within the family Teratosphaeriaceae (Capnodiales, Dothideomycetes). The first lineage is here described as a new acidotolerant genus and species Acidiella bohemica gen. nov. et sp. nov. The most closely related species to this new clade are other extremotolerant fungi isolated from rocks and lichens collected in the Alps and Antarctica as well as leaf-spotting species and opportunistic human pathogens. The isolates belonging to the second and the third lineages were identified as the recently described acidophilic fungi Acidomyces acidophilus and Teratosphaeria acidotherma, respectively. The taxonomic status of both sister species is discussed and the latter species is ascribed here to the genus Acidomyces. © 2012 Mushroom Research Foundation.},

  abstract={Global warming will have far-reaching effects on our ecosystem. However, its effects on Antarctic soils have been poorly explored. To assess the effects of warming on microbial abundance and community composition, we sampled Antarctic soils from the King George Island in the Antarctic Peninsula and incubated these soils at elevated temperatures of 5°C and 8°C for 14 days. The reduction in total organic carbon and increase in soil respiration were attributed to the increased proliferation of Bacteria, Fungi, and Archaea. Interestingly, bacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes were predominant over archaeal amoA, unlike in many other environments reported previously. Phylogenetic analyses of bacterial and archaeal amoA communities via clone libraries revealed that the diversity of amoA genes in Antarctic ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotic communities were temperature-insensitive. Interestingly, our data also showed that the amoA of Antarctic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities differed from previously described amoA sequences of cultured isolates and clone library sequences, suggesting the presence of novel Antarctic-specific AOB communities. Denitrification-related genes were significantly reduced under warming conditions, whereas the abundance of amoA and nifH increased. Barcoded pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the major phyla in Antarctic soils and the effect of short-term warming on the bacterial community was not apparent. © 2013 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.},

  abstract={Lichens, symbiotic associations of fungi (mycobionts) and green algae or cyanobacteria (photobionts), are poikilohydric organisms that are particularly well adapted to withstand adverse environmental conditions. Terrestrial ecosystems of the Antarctic are therefore largely dominated by lichens. The effects of global climate change are especially pronounced in the maritime Antarctic and it may be assumed that the lichen vegetation will profoundly change in the future. The genetic diversity of populations is closely correlated to their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and to their future evolutionary potential. In this study, we present evidence for low genetic diversity in Antarctic mycobiont and photobiont populations of the widespread lichen Cetraria aculeata. We compared between 110 and 219 DNA sequences from each of three gene loci for each symbiont. A total of 222 individuals from three Antarctic and nine antiboreal, temperate and Arctic populations were investigated. The mycobiont diversity is highest in Arctic populations, while the photobionts are most diverse in temperate regions. Photobiont diversity decreases significantly towards the Antarctic but less markedly towards the Arctic, indicating that ecological factors play a minor role in determining the diversity of Antarctic photobiont populations. Richness estimators calculated for the four geographical regions suggest that the low genetic diversity of Antarctic populations is not a sampling artefact. Cetraria aculeata appears to have diversified in the Arctic and subsequently expanded its range into the Southern Hemisphere. The reduced genetic diversity in the Antarctic is most likely due to founder effects during long-distance colonization. © 2012 S. Domaschke et al.},

  abstract={The fate of carbon (C) contained within permafrost in boreal forest environments is an important consideration for the current and future carbon cycle as soils warm in northern latitudes. Currently, little is known about the microbiology or chemistry of permafrost soils that may affect its decomposition once soils thaw. We tested the hypothesis that low microbial abundances and activities in permafrost soils limit decomposition rates compared with active layer soils. We examined active layer and permafrost soils near Fairbanks, AK, the Yukon River, and the Arctic Circle. Soils were incubated in the lab under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Gas fluxes at -5 and 5 °C were measured to calculate temperature response quotients (Q10). The Q10 was lower in permafrost soils (average 2.7) compared with active layer soils (average 7.5). Soil nutrients, leachable dissolved organic C (DOC) quality and quantity, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the soils revealed that the organic matter within permafrost soils is as labile, or even more so, than surface soils. Microbial abundances (fungi, bacteria, and subgroups: methanogens and Basidiomycetes) and exoenzyme activities involved in decomposition were lower in permafrost soils compared with active layer soils, which, together with the chemical data, supports the reduced Q10 values. CH4 fluxes were correlated with methanogen abundance and the highest CH4 production came from active layer soils. These results suggest that permafrost soils have high inherent decomposability, but low microbial abundances and activities reduce the temperature sensitivity of C fluxes. Despite these inherent limitations, however, respiration per unit soil C was higher in permafrost soils compared with active layer soils, suggesting that decomposition and heterotrophic respiration may contribute to a positive feedback to warming of this eco region.

The ability of the strain to produce simultaneously phosphatidylethanolamines and rhamnolipid, using glucose as a sole carbon source, was demonstrated. The rhamnolipid Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and two homologs of phosphatidylethanolamine were extracted from cell-free supernatant of P. putida BD2 culture with ethyl acetate and identified by UPLC-MS analysis.

  abstract={Aim Current evidence from temperate studies suggests that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi require overland routes for migration because of their obligate symbiotic associations with woody plants. Despite their key roles in arctic ecosystems, the phylogenetic diversity and phylogeography of arctic ECM fungi remains little known. Here we assess the phylogenetic diversity of ECM communities in an isolated, formerly glaciated, high arctic archipelago, and provide explanations for their phylogeographic origins. Location Svalbard. Methods We generated and analysed internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences from both curated sporocarp collections (from Svalbard) and soil polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clone libraries (from Svalbard and the North American Arctic), compared these with publicly available sequences in GenBank, and estimated the phylogenetic diversity of ECM fungi in Svalbard. In addition, we conducted coalescent analyses to estimate migration rates in selected species. Results Despite Svalbard's geographic isolation and arctic climate, its ECM fungi are surprisingly diverse, with at least 72 non-singleton operational taxonomic units (soil) and 109 phylogroups (soil + sporocarp). The most species-rich genera are Thelephora/Tomentella, Cortinarius and Inocybe, followed by Hebeloma, Russula, Lactarius, Entoloma, Sebacina, Clavulina, Laccaria, Leccinum and Alnicola. Despite the scarcity of available reference data from other arctic regions, the majority of the phylogroups (73.4%) were also found outside Svalbard. At the same time, all putative Svalbard 'endemics' were newly sequenced taxa from diverse genera with massive undocumented diversity. Overall, our results support long-distance dispersal more strongly than vicariance and glacial survival. However, because of the high variation in nucleotide substitution rates among fungi, allopatric persistence since the Pliocene, although unlikely, cannot be statistically rejected. Results from the coalescent analyses suggest recent gene flow among different arctic areas. Main conclusions Our results indicate numerous recent colonization events and suggest that long-distance, transoceanic dispersal is widespread in arctic ECM fungi, which differs markedly from the currently prevailing view on the dispersal capabilities of ECM fungi. Our molecular evidence indicates that long-distance dispersal has probably played a major role in the phylogeographic history of some ECM fungi in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results may have implications for studies on the biodiversity, ecology and conservation of arctic fungi in general. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

For this study, comparative analyses were conducted on lichen-associated bacterial communities to test for effects of photobiont-types (i.e. green algal vs. cyanobacterial), mycobiont-types and large-scale spatial distances (from tropical to arctic latitudes). Amplicons of the 16S (SSU) rRNA gene were examined using both Sanger sequencing of cloned fragments and barcoded pyrosequencing. Rhizobiales is typically the most abundant and taxonomically diverse order in lichen microbiomes; however, overall bacterial diversity in lichens is shown to be much higher than previously reported. Members of Acidobacteriaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Brucellaceae and sequence group LAR1 are the most commonly found groups across the phylogenetically and geographically broad array of lichens examined here. Major bacterial community trends are significantly correlated with differences in large-scale geography, photobiont-type and mycobiont-type. The lichen as a microcosm represents a structured, unique microbial habitat with greater ecological complexity and bacterial diversity than previously appreciated and can serve as a model system for studying larger ecological and evolutionary principles. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract={Antarctic environments can sustain a great diversity of well-adapted microorganisms known as psychrophiles or psychrotrophs. The potential of these microorganisms as a resource of enzymes able to maintain their activity and stability at low temperature for technological applications has stimulated interest in exploration and isolation of microbes from this extreme environment. Enzymes produced by these organisms have a considerable potential for technological applications because they are known to have higher enzymatic activities at lower temperatures than their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts. A total of 518 Antarctic microorganisms, were isolated during Antarctic expeditions organized by the Instituto Antártico Uruguayo. Samples of particules suspended in air, ice, sea and freshwater, soil, sediment, bird and marine animal faeces, dead animals, algae, plants, rocks and microbial mats were collected from different sites in maritime Antarctica. We report enzymatic activities present in 161 microorganisms (120 bacteria, 31 yeasts and 10 filamentous fungi) isolated from these locations. Enzymatic performance was evaluated at 4 and 20°C. Most of yeasts and bacteria grew better at 20°C than at 4°C, however the opposite was observed with the fungi. Amylase, lipase and protease activities were frequently found in bacterial strains. Yeasts and fungal isolates typically exhibited lipase, celullase and gelatinase activities. Bacterial isolates with highest enzymatic activities were identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as Pseudomonas spp., Psychrobacter sp., Arthrobacter spp., Bacillus sp. and Carnobacterium sp. Yeasts and fungal strains, with multiple enzymatic activities, belonged to Cryptococcus victoriae, Trichosporon pullulans and Geomyces pannorum. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract={Carbon stocks in the High Arctic are particularly sensitive to global climate change and the investigation of the variation in organic matter (OM) composition is beneficial for improved understanding of OM vulnerability. OM biomarker characterization of solvent-extractable compounds and CuO oxidation products of littoral sedimentary OM in the Canadian Arctic was conducted to determine OM sources and decomposition patterns. The solvent-extracts contained a series of aliphatic lipids, steroids and one triterpenoid of higher plant origin as well as the low abundance of iso- and anteiso-alkanes originating from Cerastium arcticum (Arctic mouse-ear chickweed), a native angiosperm. The carbon preference index (CPI) of the n-alkane, n-alkanol and n-alkanoic acid biomarkers suggests relatively fresh lipid material in the early stages of degradation. The CuO oxidation products were comprised of benzenes, lignin-derived phenols and short-chain diacids and hydroxyacids. A high abundance of these terrestrial biomarkers at sites close to the river inlet suggests soil-derived fluvial inputs are an important source of OM delivered to the littoral sediments. The high lignin-derived phenol ratios of acids to aldehydes suggest that lignin degradation is in a relatively advanced oxidation stage. The absence of ergosterol, a common fungal biomarker also suggests that lignin-derived OM may be preserved in soil OM and transported to littoral sediments. This representative OM characterization suggests that Arctic sedimentary OM is a mixture of recently deposited and/or preserved lipids in permafrost melt and oxidized lignin-derived OM that may become destabilized from external influences such as climate change. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Methods and Results: Eriophorum scheuchzeri, Potentilla cf. rubricaulis, Oxyria digyna, Salix arctica and Puccinellia angustata plant species were collected at Eureka (Canadian high Arctic) along with their rhizospheric soil samples. Their bacterial community fingerprints (16S rRNA gene, DGGE) were distinctive encompassing members from the phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Isolated diesel-degrading bacteria belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Strains of Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Intrasporangiaceae, Leifsoni and Arthrobacter possessed alkB and Pseudomonas possessed both ndoB and xylE gene sequences. Two Rhodococcus strains mineralized [1-14C] hexadecane at 5 and -5°C. From the rhizosphere of P. angustata, larger numbers of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were isolated than from other plant rhizosphere samples and all three genes alkB (from Actinobacteria), ndoB and xylE (from Pseudomonas) were detected by PCR. Conclusions: (i) Arctic plants have unique rhizospheric bacterial communities. (ii) P. angustata has potential for phytoremediation research at high Arctic soils. (iii) Isolated bacteria mineralized hydrocarbons at ambient low temperatures. Significance and Impact of the Study: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rhizospheric exploration examining the phytoremediation potential of five Arctic plants and evaluating their microbial hydrocarbon-degrading capacities. © 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

  abstract={Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) live asymptomatically in the roots of vascular plants, are common in arctic and alpine areas, and are thought to play a quasimycorrhizal role. It is not known, however, whether they precede or arrive with their hosts. Previously reported enzymatic abilities of Phialocephala fortinii suggest that DSEs can live on organic debris in the soil, but there is little direct or experimental evidence for this. Phialocephala fortinii, Leptodontidium orchidicola, Cadophora melinii, Cadophora luteo-olivacea, and Lecythophora sp. were inoculated onto autoclaved Hylocomium splendens gametophytes and incubated for 3 months to determine if they degrade this organic material based on observations made using light and scanning electron microscopy. All fungi were able to colonize the bryophyte tissue to some extent. Lecythophora sp. and L. orchidicola penetrated cells by forming bore holes. Cadophora luteo-olivacea and P. fortinii were also observed inside cells, but bore holes through bryophyte cell walls were not observed. Cadophora melinii sporulated and grew abundantly on the surface of gametophytes but did not appear to penetrate cell walls. Phialocephala fortinii and L. orchidicola formed sclerotia in the gametophytes similar to those formed in roots. These results suggest that DSE fungi can persist and produce propagules, i.e., sclerotia and conidia, in the absence of host roots. These observations support the hypothesis that DSE fungi are able to precede their hosts during primary succession events.},

  abstract={Tundra ecosystem is of importance for its high accumulation of organic carbon and vulnerability to future climate change. Microorganisms play a key role in carbon dynamics of the tundra ecosystem by mineralizing organic carbon. We assessed both ecosystem process rates and community structure of Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi in different soil layers (surface organic layer and subsurface mineral soil) in an Arctic soil ecosystem located at Spitsbergen, Svalbard during the summer of 2008 by using biochemical and molecular analyses, such as enzymatic assay, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and pyrosequencing. Activity of hydrolytic enzymes showed difference according to soil type. For all three microbial communities, the average gene copy number did not significantly differ between soil types. However, archaeal diversities appeared to differ according to soil type, whereas bacterial and fungal diversity indices did not show any variation. Correlation analysis between biogeochemical and microbial parameters exhibited a discriminating pattern according to microbial or soil types. Analysis of the microbial community structure showed that bacterial and archaeal communities have different profiles with unique phylotypes in terms of soil types. Water content and hydrolytic enzymes were found to be related with the structure of bacterial and archaeal communities, whereas soil organic matter (SOM) and total organic carbon (TOC) were related with bacterial communities. The overall results of this study indicate that microbial enzyme activity were generally higher in the organic layer than in mineral soils and that bacterial and archaeal communities differed between the organic layer and mineral soils in the Arctic region. Compared to mineral soil, peat-covered organic layer may represent a hotspot for secondary productivity and nutrient cycling in this ecosystem. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract={Arctic environments, where surface temperatures increase and sea ice cover and permafrost depth decrease, are very sensitive to even slight climatic variations. Placing recent environmental change of the high-northern latitudes in a long-term context is, however, complicated by too short meteorological observations and too few proxy records. Driftwood may represent a unique cross-disciplinary archive at the interface of marine and terrestrial processes. Here, we introduce 1445 driftwood remains from coastal East Greenland and Svalbard. Macroscopy and microscopy were applied for wood anatomical classification; a multi-species subset was used for detecting fungi; and information on boreal vegetation patterns, circumpolar river systems, and ocean current dynamics was reviewed and evaluated. Four conifer (Pinus, Larix, Picea, and Abies) and three deciduous (Populus, Salix, and Betula) genera were differentiated. Species-specific identification also separated Pinus sylvestris and Pinus sibirica, which account for ∼40% of all driftwood and predominantly originate from western and central Siberia. Larch and spruce from Siberia or North America represents ∼26% and ∼18% of all materials, respectively. Fungal colonization caused different levels of driftwood staining and/or decay. Our results demonstrate the importance of combining wood anatomical knowledge with insight on boreal forest composition for successfully tracing the origin of Arctic driftwood. To ultimately reconstruct spatiotemporal variations in ocean currents, and to better quantify postglacial uplift rates, we recommend consideration of dendrochronologically dated material from many more circumpolar sites. © 2013.

The moss profiles were divided into 6 (H. splendens) and 5 (R. lanuginosum) layers according to the color and texture, and hyphal length, fungal assemblages, and contents of organic chemical components (acid-unhydrolyzable residues, total carbohydrates, extractives) and nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) were measured. Total hyphal length was greatest at the middle layers of H. splendens and at the deepest layers of R. lanuginosum and was significantly affected by moss species and nutrient contents. A total of 18 and 19 fungal taxa was isolated from the profiles of H. splendens and R. lanuginosum, respectively, with 11 taxa being common to both moss species. Moss species significantly affected the species distribution of fungi. Individual fungal taxa showed patterns of vertical distribution within the moss profiles. The contents of acid-unhydrolyzable residues and nutrients increased and the content of total carbohydrates decreased down the profile, which was attributable to the ability of fungi to decompose carbohydrates selectively and to immobilize nutrients in decomposed moss residues. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.},

Two hundred and forty-three DSE were isolated from roots collected from 17 sites across a 1 470 km transect through maritime and sub-Antarctica. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene cluster of representative isolates was sequenced, and the sequences were recovered in 10 sequence groups and sub-groups.

A description of the species is given, together with information on its geographical distribution, reproduction, habitats, associated organisms and responses to environmental stresses. Characteristics of its photosynthetic physiology are also presented, including data on oxygen evolution rates and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. Substratum and tissue chemistry, water relations and pigments are discussed, along with recent data demonstrating that the dark pigment in the apical leaves of C. varians is the anthocyanidin riccionidin A. Recent studies showing that the ericoid mycorrhizal symbiont Rhizoscyphus ericae is present in the tissues of the plant at a wide range of locations in the maritime and sub-Antarctic are also described. It is evident, from the literature reviewed, that C. varians has several adaptations that enable it to survive in the Antarctic biome, explaining its survival at higher latitudes than any other hepatic. The species major adaptations include the synthesis of riccionidin A in apical leaves, enabling efficient heat absorption and protection from photoinhibition, and the presence in stems and rhizoids of fungal hyphae, which are potentially beneficial to the hepatics nutrition and possibly also synthesize cryoprotectants. © 2009 Antarctic Science Ltd.},

They dominate on 8% of the world's land surface, mainly in Arctic and Antarctic regions, tundra, high mountain elevations and as components of dryland crusts. In many ecosystems, lichens are the pioneers on the bare rock or soil following disturbance, presumably because of their tolerance to desiccation and high temperature. Lichens have long been recognized as agents of mineral weathering and fine-earth stabilization. Being dominant biomass producers in extreme environments they contribute to primary accumulation of soil organic matter. However, biochemical role of lichens in soil processes is unknown. Our recent research has demonstrated that Peltigeralean lichens contain redox enzymes which in free-living fungi participate in lignocellulose degradation and humification. Thus lichen enzymes may catalyse formation and degradation of soil organic matter, particularly in high-stress communities dominated by lower plants. In the present review we synthesize recently published data on lichen phenol oxidases, peroxidases, and cellulases and discuss their possible roles in lichen physiology and soil organic matter transformations. © 2013 The British Mycological Society.},

  abstract={Mycelial fungi in a solonchakous chestnut soil, a sulfate solonchak, and a soda solonchak were studied in the western Lake Baikal basin. The humus content, the degree of salinization, and the composition of salts affected the structure of the micromycete communities. In the chestnut soil, more than half of the species identified were found. The species diversity was higher in the nonsaline and humus horizons. The eolian deposit on the soda solonchak was characterized by the presence of six species of fungi that did not occur in other soil horizons. Their occurrence in the fresh deposit seems to be related to the eolian transfer of fungi with the fine earth from the adjacent areas with the nonsaline soils. The soda solonchak fungi are dominated by the haloalkalitolerant and alkalophilic micromycetes, among which the representatives of the Acremonium (A. antarcticum and A. rutilum) and Verticillum genera and Mycelia sterilia were identified. There was also an alkalophilic ascomycete, which is an indicator of soda salinization-Heleococcum alkalinum. On the whole, the soda solonchak had the lowest number of fungal germs and the lowest species diversity of mycelial fungi among the soils compared. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  abstract={A novel actinomycete, strain W6T, was isolated from a soil sample of Yunnan Province, China. The bacterium was aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming and Gram-stain-positive. Genetic, phenotypic and chemical properties of the isolate were studied. 16S rRNA gene sequence data suggested that the novel isolate belonged to the genus Friedmanniella and shared 98.6 % sequence similarity with Friedmanniella antarctica DSM 11053T and Friedmanniella okinawensis DSM 21744T, the most closely related species. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, and mycolic acids were absent. The main menaquinone was MK-9(H4) and the predominant fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0. The phospholipid profile contained phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and diphosphatidylglycerol. The DNA G+C content of strain W6T was 72 mol%. Strain W6T showed 30.0 % and 28.5 % DNA-DNA relatedness, respectively, to F. antarctica DSM 11053T and F. okinawensis DSM 21744T. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data showed that strain W6T should be assigned to the genus Friedmanniella as a representative of a novel species, for which the name Friedmanniella flava sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is W6T (= CGMCC 4.6856T = JCM 17701T). © 2013 IUMS.},

  abstract={Throughout the history of polar exploration and up to recent times, wood and other exotic materials have been brought to the Antarctic continent and left there. While the possible transportation of exotic fungal species on these materials is sometimes considered, the effects of these exotic substrates on indigenous fungal communities have not been previously evaluated. This study reports results from seven plots where organic materials were used in baiting studies to determine the fungal diversity present in soils. Four plots were on islands in the Palmer Archipelago on the Antarctic Peninsula and three at Ross Island, Antarctica. Samples of sterile wood and cellulose with and without nutrients added were buried in soil and left for either two or four years before being removed and evaluated for fungal colonization. There was a significant increase in fungal colony-forming units (CFU) from soil in direct contact with introduced, sterile wood and cellulose substrates compared to background soil levels. The type of substrate, 2 or 4 year incubation period in the field, or nutrient addition did not have a significant effect on culturable densities in soil. Fungal abundance on soil adhering to substrates was found to be similar to that found in non-polar soils indicating that lack of organic material may be the most significant limiting factor affecting densities of Antarctic fungal populations. Based on a high degree of colonization, these exotic substrates appear to have a significant effect on indigenous soil fungal abundance. © 2010 Kevin D. Hyde.},

Interestingly, AOB amoA was found to be more abundant than AOA amoA in Antarctic soils. The results of microcosm studies revealed that the fungal and archaeal communities were diminished in response to warming temperatures (10 °C) and that the archaeal community was less sensitive to nitrogen addition, which suggests that those two communities are well-adapted to colder temperatures. AOA amoA and norB genes were reduced with warming temperatures. The abundance of only the nifH and nirK genes increased with both warming and the addition of nitrogen. NirS-type denitrifying bacteria outnumbered NirK-type denitrifiers regardless of the treatment used. Interestingly, dramatic increases in both NirS and NirK-types denitrifiers were observed with nitrogen addition. NirK types increase with warming, but NirS-type denitrifiers tend to be less sensitive to warming. Our findings indicated that the Antarctic microbial nitrogen cycle could be dramatically altered by temperature and nitrogen, and that warming may be detrimental to the ammonia-oxidizing archaeal community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate genes associated with each process of the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle in an Antarctic terrestrial soil environment. © 2011 Institut Pasteur.},

  abstract={The metaviromes of two distinct Antarctic hyperarid desert soil communities have been characterized. Hypolithic communities, cyanobacterium-dominated assemblages situated on the ventral surfaces of quartz pebbles embedded in the desert pavement, showed higher virus diversity than surface soils, which correlated with previous bacterial community studies. Prokaryotic viruses (i.e., phages) represented the largest viral component (particularly Mycobacterium phages) in both habitats, with an identical hierarchical sequence abundance of families of tailed phages (Siphoviridae > Myoviridae > Podoviridae). No archaeal viruses were found. Unexpectedly, cyanophages were poorly represented in both metaviromes and were phylogenetically distant from currently characterized cyanophages. Putative phage genomes were assembled and showed a high level of unaffiliated genes, mostly from hypolithic viruses. Moreover, unusual gene arrangements in which eukaryotic and prokaryotic virus-derived genes were found within identical genome segments were observed. Phycodnaviridae and Mimiviridae viruses were the second-mostabundant taxa and more numerous within open soil. Novel virophage-like sequences (within the Sputnik clade) were identified. These findings highlight high-level virus diversity and novel species discovery potential within Antarctic hyperarid soils and may serve as a starting point for future studies targeting specific viral groups. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

  abstract={Knowledge of the occurrence, distribution and diversity of pathogens of insects and arachnids (entomopathogens) in the Arctic is very limited. Climate change is expected to affect Arctic terrestrial arthropod communities and therefore also host-pathogen interactions, given that entomopathogens are present. We conducted a survey of fungal entomopathogens in soil samples collected at four localities in Greenland; two at low Arctic sites (Ritenbenk and Disko Island) and two at sites in the high Arctic (Zackenberg and Danmarkshavn). Fungi were isolated from soil samples using larvae of the insect species Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera) and Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera) as baits providing evidence that the fungal isolates were indeed entomopathogenic. Five fungal species (Ascomycota; Hypocreales) were found: Isaria fumosorosea Wize, Isaria farinosa (Holmsk.) Fr., Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill., Beauveria pseudobassiana Rehner and Humber and Tolypocladium inflatum W. Gams (syn. = T. niveum). I. farinosa was found at all four localities, while I. fumosorosea was detected in single samples at each of three localities including both high Arctic sites. Only the locality on Disko Island revealed B. bassiana, whereas B. pseudobassiana was isolated at the three other sites. T. inflatum was only found on Disko Island and only isolated with T. molitor as a bait insect. The results document that fungal entomopathogens are widely distributed in the soil environment in Greenland. Entomopathogens should therefore be included in future studies of arthropod ecology in the Arctic. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Climate warming is leading to shrub expansion in Arctic tundra. Shrubs form ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations with soil fungi that are central to ecosystem carbon balance as determinants of plant community structure and as decomposers of soil organic matter. To assess potential climate change impacts on ECM communities, we analysed fungal internal transcribed spacer sequences from ECM root tips of the dominant tundra shrub Betula nana growing in treatments plots that had received long-term warming by greenhouses and/or fertilization as part of the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research experiment at Toolik Lake Alaska, USA. We demonstrate opposing effects of long-term warming and fertilization treatments on ECM fungal diversity; with warming increasing and fertilization reducing the diversity of ECM communities. We show that warming leads to a significant increase in high biomass fungi with proteolytic capacity, especially Cortinarius spp., and a reduction of fungi with high affinities for labile N, especially Russula spp. In contrast, fertilization treatments led to relatively small changes in the composition of the ECM community, but increased the abundance of saprotrophs. Our data suggest that warming profoundly alters nutrient cycling in tundra, and may facilitate the expansion of B. nana through the formation of mycorrhizal networks of larger size. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract={The taxonomic and ecological diversity of ancient fungal communities was assessed by combining next generation sequencing and metabarcoding of DNA preserved in permafrost. Twenty-six sediment samples dated 16000-32000 radiocarbon years old from two localities in Siberia were analysed for fungal ITS. We detected 75 fungal OTUs from 21 orders representing three phyla, although rarefaction analyses suggested that the full diversity was not recovered despite generating an average of 6677±3811 (mean±SD) sequences per sample and that preservation bias likely has considerable effect on the recovered DNA. Most OTUs (75.4%) represented ascomycetes. Due to insufficient sequencing depth, DNA degradation and putative preservation biases in our samples, the recovered taxa probably do not represent the complete historic fungal community, and it is difficult to determine whether the fungal communities varied geographically or experienced a composition shift within the period of 16000-32000 bp. However, annotation of OTUs to functional ecological groups provided a wealth of information on the historic communities. About one-third of the OTUs are presumed plant-associates (pathogens, saprotrophs and endophytes) typical of graminoid- and forb-rich habitats. We also detected putative insect pathogens, coprophiles and keratinophiles likely associated with ancient insect and herbivore faunas. The detection of putative insect pathogens, mycoparasites, aquatic fungi and endophytes broadens our previous knowledge of the diversity of fungi present in Beringian palaeoecosystems. A large group of putatively psychrophilic/psychrotolerant fungi was also detected, most likely representing a modern, metabolically active fungal community. © 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Microscopic examination of plants indicated that fungal hyphae colonised 78% of the rhizoids of the liverwort, apparently by entering the tips of rhizoids prior to growing into their bases, where they formed hyphal coils. Extensive colonisation of stem medullary cells by hyphae was also observed. DNA was extracted from surface-sterilised liverwort tissues and sequenced following nested PCR, using the primer set ITS1F/TW14, followed by a second round of amplification using the ITSSeb3/TW13 primer set. Neighbour-joining analyses showed that the sequences obtained nested in Sebacinales clade B as a 100% supported sister group to Sebacinales sequences from the leafy liverworts Lophozia sudetica, L. incisa and Calypogeia muelleriana sampled from Europe. Direct PCR using the fungal specific primer set ITS1F/ITS4 similarly identified fungi belonging to Sebacinales clade B as the principal colonists of L. excisa tissues.

  abstract={Wild boar are now present on all continents except Antarctica and can greatly affect community structure and ecosystem function. Their destructive feeding habits, primarily rooting disturbance, can reduce plant cover, diversity, and regeneration. Furthermore, predation and habitat destruction by boar can greatly affect animal communities. Effects of wild boar on fungi and aquatic communities are scarcely studied, and soil properties and processes seem more resistant to disturbance. Wild boar also affect humans' economy as they cause crop damage and transmit diseases to livestock and wildlife. In this review, we found that most of the published literature examines boar effects in their introduced range and little is available from the native distribution. Because most of the research describes direct effects of wild boar on plant communities and predation on some animal communities, less is known about indirect effects on ecosystem function. Finally, predictive research and information on ecosystem recovery after wild boar removal are scarce. We identified research gaps and urge the need to lower wild boar densities. Identifying commonalities among wild boar impacts on native ecosystems across its introduced range will help in the design of management strategies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract={From 18 soil samples taken in the vicinity of the permanent Bulgarian Antarctic base "St. Kliment Ohridski" (62°38′29″S, 60°21′53″W) on Livingston Island, 109 filamentous fungi were isolated on selective media. The most widespread fungal species were members of the genera Cladosporium, Geomyces, Penicillium and Aspergillus. Other species, already recorded in Antarctic environment, were also isolated: Lecanicillium muscarium, Epicoccum nigrum and Alternaria alternata. Thirty strains demonstrating good growth were screened for antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) that play an important role in the defense of aerobic organisms against oxidative stress, by converting reactive oxygen species into nontoxic molecules. Six of them showed high enzyme activity. The tested strains produced SOD with statistically significant higher activity at 15°C than at 30°C suggesting that this enzyme is cold-active. Such SOD could be useful in medicine and cosmetics. The best producer of cold-active SOD, Aspergillus glaucus 363, cultivated in bioreactors, demonstrated optimal growth temperature at 25°C and maximum enzyme activities at 25 and 30°C for SOD and CAT, respectively. The electrophoretical analysis showed that the fungus possesses Cu/Zn-SOD. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

A number of filamentous fungi and yeasts have been documented from both - the hot and cold habitat - however, investigations on the abundance and activity of the filamentous hyphomycetes isolated are still missing. There is striking evidence that many ubiquitous species just survive in hot desert soil by their spores, however, without any physiological activity. There is also reasonable suspicion that man-made contamination of the Antarctic deserts might be the reason for finding a broad distribution of Penicillium and other ubiquitous fungi in soil and air. Basidiomycetous yeasts are reported to be endemic in the dry valley of Antarctica. Unrivaled conquerors of the desert environment are black, microcolonial fungi that are part of the epi- and endolithic community in hot and cold arid and semi-arid habitats.

  abstract={Aim: The relative importance of long-distance dispersal versus vicariance in determining the distribution of lichen-forming fungi remains unresolved. Here, we examined diversity and distributions in a cosmopolitan lichen-forming fungal species complex, Rhizoplaca melanophthalma sensu lato (Ascomycota), across a broad, intercontinental geographical distribution. We sought to determine the temporal context of diversification and the impacts of past climatic fluctuations on demographic dynamics within this group. Location: Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Methods: We obtained molecular sequence data from a total of 240 specimens of R. melanophthalma s.l. collected across five continents. We assessed the monophyly of candidate species using individual gene trees and a tree from a seven-locus concatenated data set. Divergence times and relationships among candidate species were evaluated using a multilocus coalescent-based species tree approach. Speciation probabilities were estimated using the coalescent-based species delimitation program bpp. We also calculated statistics on molecular diversity and population demographics for independent lineages. Main conclusions: Our analyses of R. melanophthalma s.l. collected from five continents supported the presence of six species-level lineages within this complex. Based on current sampling, two of these lineages were found to have broad intercontinental distributions, while the other four were limited to western North America. Of the six lineages, five were found on a single mountain in the western USA and the sixth occurred no more than 200 km away from this mountain. Our estimates of divergence times suggest that Pleistocene glacial cycles played an important role in species diversification within this group. At least three lineages show evidence of recent or ongoing population expansion. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

  abstract={Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi differ in their abilities to use nitrogen sources and may be integral to maintaining fungal and plant diversity in ecosystems in which Ericaceae occur. In this study, we tested whether the fungal communities differ among three species of co-occurring Ericaceae. Fungi colonizing Cassiope tetragona, Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea roots in the Arctic tundra were characterized via culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The cultured fungi were tested for their ability to colonize Vaccinium uliginosum in laboratory-based assays. The pure-cultured Helotiales were grouped into eight clades and dominated by the Phialocephala-Acephala complex. Representatives of these clades, plus an unknown basidiomycete with affinity to the genus Irpex (Polyporales), colonized V.uliginosum intracellularly. The Helotiales detected by direct PCR, cloning and sequencing were assigned to 14 clades and dominated by members of the Rhizoscyphus ericae complex. Ordination analyses indicated that culture-dependent and culture-independent assays provided distinct views of root fungal communities, but no evidence for host specificity. These data suggest that ericaceous roots host diverse fungal communities dominated by the Helotiales. However, these fungal communities are unlikely to be controlled by fungal host preferences. The mechanisms maintaining high diversity in root-symbiotic communities remain to be elucidated. © 2011 The Authors. New Phytologist © 2011 New Phytologist Trust.},

  abstract={Previous studies have shown the leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians to associate consistently with fungi, typically the ericoid mycorrhizal symbiont Rhizoscyphus ericae, across a wide latitudinal gradient in the maritime and sub-Antarctic. Hitherto, however, there are no quantitative data on the intensity of colonisation of C. varians by fungal structures in the natural environment and how colonisation might vary with changing environmental conditions. A study is hence reported showing that the frequency of colonisation by fungal structures of C. varians alters along a latitudinal transect from South Georgia (54° S, 38° W) to Moutonnée Valley on Alexander Island (71° S, 68° W). The percentage of stem length colonised by dark septate (DS) hyphae increased significantly along the transect, from 30% at South Georgia to 97% at Moutonnée Valley. In contrast, the percentage of stem length colonised by hyaline hyphae decreased significantly, from 85% at South Georgia to 13% at Moutonnée Valley, and that colonised by hyphal coils similarly decreased from 71% at the former location to 15% at the latter. The frequencies of DS hyphae were negatively associated with mean annual and seasonal air temperatures, whereas those of hyaline septate hyphae and hyphal coils were positively associated with air temperatures. Coils at northerly locations were more convoluted than those at southerly locations. The data indicate that hyphal coils, usually associated with nutrient exchange between partners in ericoid mycorrhizas, do form in C. varians tissues in the maritime and sub-Antarctic, but that the frequency of these structures diminishes in colder habitats. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Novel cultivation strategies for bacteria are widespread and well described for recovering greater diversity from the "hitherto" unculturable majority. While similar approaches have not yet been demonstrated for fungi it has been suggested that of the 1.5 million estimated species less than 5% have been recovered into pure culture. Fungi are known to be involved in many degradative processes, including the breakdown of petroleum hydrocarbons, and it has been speculated that in Polar Regions they contribute significantly to bioremediation of contaminated soils. Given the biotechnological potential of fungi there is a need to increase efforts for greater species recovery, particularly from extreme environments such as sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. In this study, like the yet-to-be cultured bacteria, high concentrations of nutrients selected for predominantly different fungal species to that recovered using a low nutrient media. By combining both media approaches to the cultivation of fungi from contaminated and non-contaminated soils, 91 fungal species were recovered, including 63 unidentified species. A preliminary biodegradation activity assay on a selection of isolates found that a high proportion of novel and described fungal species from a range of soil samples were capable of hydrocarbon degradation and should be characterized further.© 2011 Ferrari, Zhang and van Dorst.},

  abstract={Shrub growth has increased across the Arctic in recent decades and is strongly limited by soil nitrogen (N) availability. In order to understand the role of N in controlling shrub growth, we compared N-cycling in tall birch (Betula glandulosa) and surrounding dwarf birch hummock vegetation on similar soils in a Canadian low arctic site. Stable isotope tracer analysis revealed N pools and cycling rates were ~3 times larger and faster in the tall birch ecosystem in the late growing season, just prior to leaf senescence. Gross NH4+-N production rates in these ecosystems correlated positively with larger pools and production rates of dissolved soil C and N, higher quality litter inputs and lower soil C. Analyses of the soil microbial community in both ecosystems indicated similar fungal dominance (epifluorescence microscopy) and similar compositions of the principal fungal or bacterial phylotypes (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). Together, these results strongly suggest that vegetation feedbacks associated with larger inputs of higher quality litter promote rapid soil N-cycling and enhanced shrub growth in tall birch tundra. We conclude that these litter-related feedbacks during summer may be as important as snow-shrub feedbacks in maintaining and promoting differences in shrub growth across the arctic landscape. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

Using a combination of molecular fingerprinting techniques and metabolic rate measurements, we examined the soil microbial community composition and key transformations in the C and N cycles at a glacial foreland on Anvers Island along the Antarctic Peninsula. Soils were sampled along transects representing a chronosequence of <1 to approximately 10 years since deglaciation. The soil microbial community was active adjacent to the receding edge of the glacier, where soil had been ice-free for <1 year. A survey of the microbial community composition identified typical soil bacterial species such as Arthrobacter and Sphingomonas, as well as known Antarctic heterotrophs, cyanobacteria and fungi. The soil C cycle over this zone was dominated by phototrophic microbial activity, while the N cycle was dominated by heterotrophic N 2-fixation and not cyanobacterial N 2-fixation as found at other recently deglaciated forelands. Other N transformations such as ammonia oxidation and denitrification appeared to be of limited relevance. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

When the pesticides were used at 0.45 μg per disk, a concentration similar to that found when pesticides are applied under field conditions, no inhibition was observed. Strains growth was affected at concentrations of 45 and 450 μg pesticide per disk. These higher concentrations can be encountered when seeds are treated with pesticides. Pesticides tolerance level was correlated to pesticide function, i.e rhizobial strains were more tolerant to insecticides, followed by herbicides and then fungicides. Two fungicides, captan and mancozeb, inhibited the highest number of strains. Only one insecticide, carbaryl, affected the growth of some rhizobial strains. Strains isolated from the arctic (Mesorhizobium spp. and R. leguminosarum bv. viciae), a putative pesticides-free environment, were either less or equally affected by pesticides compared to strains isolated from agricultural regions.},

The difference between the optimal temperature of cellulase and microbial fermentation, however, has been identified as the critical problem with SSF. In this study, one fungal strain (AnsX1) with high cellulase activity at low temperature was isolated from Antarctic soils and identified as Verticillium sp. by morphological and molecular analyses. Results: The biochemical properties of crude AnsX1 cellulase samples were studied by filter paper cellulase assay. The maximum cellulase activity was achieved at low temperature in an acidic environment with addition of metal ions. Furthermore, AnsX1 cellulase demonstrated 54-63% enzymatic activity at ethanol concentrations of 5-10%. AnsX1 cellulase production was influenced by inoculum size, carbon and nitrogen sources, and elicitors. The optimal culture conditions for AnsX1 cellulase production were 5% inoculum, wheat bran as carbon source, (NH4)2SO4 as nitrogen source, and sorbitol added in the medium. Conclusions: Our present work has potential to enable the development of an economic and efficient cold-adapted cellulase system for bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels in future.},

  abstract={Fungi are ubiquitous in Arctic soils, where they function as symbionts and decomposers and may affect the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems subjected to climate change, and yet little is known about soil fungi at high latitudes. Here we review data from recent molecular studies to determine broad patterns in Arctic soil fungal ecology. The data indicate comparatively high fungal diversity in Arctic soils, with currently no evidence for lower species richness at higher latitudes. The dominant fungi, and particularly ectomycorrhizal-forming fungi, appear to be cosmopolitan species. Arctic soil fungi are capable of growth at sub-zero temperatures, melanized forms are frequent, host specificity is low and there is evidence that community composition alters under experimental warming. Future challenges are to determine the drivers of fungal diversity, whether or not diversity alters at higher latitudes and how apparently cosmopolitan fungi are able to survive the extreme environments encountered in Arctic habitats. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

  abstract={Soil filamentous fungi from Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen, were studied. A total of 30 fungal isolates were identified by morpho-taxonomy, and the identity of some morpho-taxonomically complex isolates was authenticated by ITS1-5.8S and ITS2 rDNA domain sequence similarity. The isolates belonged to 19 species under 14 genera (Acremonium, Arthrinium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Corynespora, Emericella, Geomyces, Mortierella, Mucor, Myrothecium, Penicillium, Phialophora, Preussia, Xylaria). To the best of our knowledge, Acremonium roseolum, Aspergillus aculeatus, Emericella nidulans, and Preussia sp. are the first northernmost records from Arctic soils. The viable fungal count in different soil samples varied from 0.5 × 104 to 2.0 × 105 g-1. Species richness in different soil samples was also calculated. Mortierella was one of the most dominant genera in Arctic soils. A temperature tolerance study was carried out for all the isolates, and representative species were screened for their extracellular enzyme activity (amylase, cellulase, phosphatase, and pectinase) at 4°C and 20°C. Among the 30 isolates, seven showed cellulolytic activity, two were phosphate solubilizers, three had amylolytic activity, and only one showed pectinolytic activity on solid media. CMCase (β1, 4-endoglucanase) activity was quantified in seven isolates that exhibited positive activity during preliminary screening. The records of enzyme activity for amylases, pectinases, and cellulases are the first from the fungi of Spitsbergen. The present study indicates the dominance in Ny-Ålesund of cellulolytic strains, which may serve as potent decomposers in Arctic tundra. These isolates may be used to facilitate the mineralization of cellulolytic wastes generated by human activities in colder hilly areas across the world, including the Himalayas in India. © The Arctic Institute of North America.},

  abstract={Abstract: Growth and respiration of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with dwarf shrubs likely contribute significantly to carbon cycling in arctic tundra soils dominated by this vegetation type. Despite their importance little is known about how these fungi might respond to global warming. While previous studies have shown that some ectomycorrhizal fungi can tolerate or retain viability across a fairly wide range of temperatures little is known regarding their metabolic responses to temperature shifts. The present study was undertaken to examine the comparative physiological responses in vitro of arctic and temperate isolates of a common ectomycorrhizal fungus to shifts in growth temperature. Isolates of Cenococcum geophilum from Alaska and Maryland were grown at 12 and 20°C in liquid culture to study the process of temperature acclimation. Measurements on each isolate at the two growth temperatures included linear growth rates, dry weight accumulation, oxygen consumption and the specific activities of the soluble enzymes glucokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In addition the response to growth temperature of glucokinase kinetic parameters (Ea, Km and Vmax) were also evaluated. Increasing the growth temperature tended to decrease the length of the observed lag phase; however, the growth rates in dry weight at 20°C closely paralleled those at 20°C. Both isolates demonstrated lower respiration rates when grown at 20 versus 12°C. Thus for oxygen uptake each isolate demonstrated a phenotypic response known as ideal rate compensation. That is growth at 20°C resulted in oxygen uptake rates at 20°C that were similar to those measured at 12°C for 12°C-grown mycelium. This strategy, if common in ectomycorrhizal fungi, would reduce the expected carbon demand placed on the host and decrease the amount of carbon dioxide released by respiration in response to anticipated increases in soil temperatures. Differences in overall respiration rates by 12 and 20°C grown mycelium could not be explained by changes in activities of soluble enzymes examined. Likewise few differences were observed in glucokinase kinetic parameters associated with growth temperature. Examination of soluble enzyme activity ratios as influenced by growth temperature suggests the potential exists to alter relative fluxes through primary metabolic pathways and warrants further investigation. Future studies of temperature acclimation should examine a wider range of ectomycorrhizal fungi and employ techniques such as DNA microarrays and metabolomics. © 2010 Pacific Northwest Fungi Project.},

  abstract={Hypoliths (cryptic microbial assemblages that develop on the undersides of translucent rocks) are significant contributors to regional C and N budgets in both hot and cold deserts. Previous studies in the Dry Valleys of Eastern Antarctica have reported three morphologically distinct hypolithic community types: cyanobacteria dominated (type I), fungus dominated (type II) and moss dominated (type III). Here we present terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses to elucidate the bacterial community structure in hypolithons and the surrounding soils. We show clear and robust distinction in bacterial composition between bulk surface soils and hypolithons. Moreover, the bacterial assemblages were similar in types II and III hypolithons and clearly distinct from those found in type I. Through 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing, we show that Proteobacteria dominated all three types of hypolithic communities. As expected, Cyanobacteria were more abundant in type I hypolithons, whereas Actinobacteria were relatively more abundant in types II and III hypolithons, and were the dominant group in soils. Using a probabilistic dissimilarity metric and random sampling, we demonstrate that deterministic processes are more important in shaping the structure of the bacterial community found in types II and III hypolithons. Most notably, the data presented in this study suggest that hypolithic bacterial communities establish via a successional model, with the type I hypolithons acting as the basal development state. © 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

This method is well suited for the study of culturable Antarctic soil fungal communities where both abundance and diversity are relatively low. We optimized template concentration and verified the effect of primer selection from eight commonly used fungal polymerase chain reaction primers on ARISA chromatographs for 46 fungal species commonly isolated from south Victoria Land. A database of Antarctic fungal electropherograms was produced containing each of the species and was used as the first step in a tiered system for species identification. In addition, isolates containing more than one species were identified, allowing isolates not in the database to be sequenced for further analysis. This method unambiguously identified 78% of the fungal taxa in this study and we were able to rapidly determine which isolates should be subjected to further analysis by DNA sequencing. Using this approach, the cost of analysis for abundance studies can be greatly reduced compared to DNA sequencing of each isolate. © 2012 Antarctic Science Ltd.},

Samples were collected during the austral summer season, between November 2006 and January 2007, from the rhizosphere of Deschampsia antarctica, ornithogenic (penguin guano) soil, soil, marine and lake sediments, marine water and freshwater from lakes. A total of 89 isolates belonging to the following genera were recovered: Bensingtonia, Candida, Cryptococcus, Debaryomyces, Dioszegia, Exophiala, Filobasidium, Issatchenkia (Pichia), Kodamaea, Leucosporidium, Leucosporidiella, Metschnikowia, Nadsonia, Pichia, Rhodotorula, and Sporidiobolus, and the yeast-like fungi Aureobasidium, Leuconeurospora and Microglossum. Cryptococcus victoriae was the most frequently identified species. Several species isolated in our study have been previously reported to be Antarctic psychophilic yeasts, including Cr. antarcticus, Cr. victoriae, Dioszegia hungarica and Leucosporidium scottii. The cosmopolitan yeast species A. pullulans, C. zeylanoides, D. hansenii, I. orientalis, K. ohmeri, P. guilliermondii, Rh. mucilaginosa, and S. salmonicolor were also isolated. Five possible new species were identified. Sixty percent of the yeasts had at least one detectable extracellular enzymatic activity. Cryptococcus antarcticus, D. aurantiaca, D. crocea, D. hungarica, Dioszegia sp., E. xenobiotica, Rh. glaciales, Rh. laryngis, Microglossum sp. 1 and Microglossum sp. 2 produced mycosporines. Of the yeast isolates, 41.7% produced pigments and/or mycosporines and could be considered adapted to survive in Antarctica.

Erebus contain a dark oligotrophic volcanic ecosystem (DOVE and represent a deep biosphere habitat that can provide insight into microbial communities that utilize energy sources other than photosynthesis. The community assembly and role of fungi in these environments remains largely unknown. However, these habitats could be relatively easily contaminated during human visits. Sixty-one species of fungi were identified from soil clone libraries originating from Warren Cave, a DOVE on Mt. Erebus. The species diversity was greater than has been found in the nearby McMurdo Dry Valleys oligotrophic soil. A relatively large proportion of the clones represented Malassezia species (37% of Basidomycota identified. These fungi are associated with skin surfaces of animals and require high lipid content for growth, indicating that contamination may have occurred through the few and episodic human visits in this particular cave. These findings highlight the importance of fungi to DOVE environments as well as their potential use for identifying contamination by humans. The latter offers compelling evidence suggesting more strict management of these valuable research areas. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Ice deposited in Greenland and Antarctica entraps viable and nonviable microbes, as well as biomolecules, that become temporal atmospheric records. Five sections (estimated to be 500, 10,500, 57,000, 105,000 and 157,000 years before present, ybp) from the GISP2D (Greenland) ice core, three sections (500, 30,000 and 70,000 ybp) from the Byrd ice core, and four sections from the Vostok 5G (Antarctica) ice core (10,500, 57,000, 105,000 and 105,000 ybp) were studied by scanning electron microscopy, cultivation and rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial and fungal isolates were recovered from 10 of the 12 sections. The highest numbers of isolates were found in ice core sections that were deposited during times of low atmospheric CO2, low global temperatures and low levels of atmospheric dust. Two of the sections (GISP2D at 10,500 and 157,000 ybp) also were examined using metagenomic/metatranscriptomic methods. These results indicated that sequences from microbes common to arid and saline soils were deposited in the ice during a time of low temperature, low atmospheric CO2 and high dust levels. Members of Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria were the most prevalent bacteria, while Rhodotorula species were the most common eukaryotic representatives. Isolates of Bacillus, Rhodotorula, Alternaria and members of the Davidiellaceae were isolated from both Greenland and Antarctica sections of the same age, although the sequences differed between the two polar regions. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial LSU rRNA gene sequences showed that the strains belong to the Dioszegia clade of the Tremellales (Tremellomycetes, Agaricomycotina), but did not correspond to any of the hitherto recognized species. Two novel species, Dioszegia antarctica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-116T =CBS 10920T =PYCC 5970 T) and Dioszegia cryoxerica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-071 T =CBS. 10919T =PYCC 5967T), are described to accommodate ten and three of these strains, respectively. Analysis of ITS sequences demonstrated intrastrain sequence heterogeneity in D. cryoxerica. The latter species is also notable for producing true hyphae with clamp connections and haustoria. However, no sexual structures were observed. The two novel species can be considered obligate psychrophiles, since they failed to grow above 20 °C and grew best between 10 and 15 °C. © 2010 IUMS.},

  abstract={Evaporitic deposits are a globally widespread habitat for micro-organisms. The microbe-mineral environment in weathered and remobilized gypsum from exposed mid-Ordovician marine evaporite beds in the polar desert of Devon Island, Nunavut, Canadian High Arctic was examined. The gypsum is characterized by internal green zones of cyanobacterial colonization (dominated by Gloeocapsa/Aphanothece and Chroococcidiopsis spp. morphotypes) and abundant black zones, visible from the surface, that contain pigmented cyanobacteria and fungi. Bioessential elements in the gypsum are primarily provided by allochthonous material from the present-day polar desert. The disruption, uplift and rotation of the evaporite beds by the Haughton meteorite impact 39 Ma have facilitated gypsum weathering and its accessibility as a habitat. No cultured cyanobacteria, bacteria and fungi were halophilic consistent with the expectation that halophily is not required to persist in gypsum habitats. Heterotrophic bacteria from the evaporite were slightly or moderately halotolerant, as were heterotrophs isolated from soil near the gypsum outcrop showing that halotolerance is common in arctic bacteria in this location. Psychrotolerant Arthrobacter species were isolated. No psychrophilic organisms were isolated. Two Arthrobacter isolates from the evaporite were used to mediate gypsum neogenesis in the laboratory, demonstrating a potential role for microbial biomineralization processes in polar environments. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract={The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are a cold hyperarid polar desert that present extreme challenges to life. Here, we report a culture-independent survey of multidomain microbial biodiversity in McKelvey Valley, a pristine example of the coldest desert on Earth. We demonstrate that life has adapted to form highly-specialized communities in distinct lithic niches occurring concomitantly within this terrain. Endoliths and chasmoliths in sandstone displayed greatest diversity, whereas soil was relatively depauperate and lacked a significant photoautotrophic component, apart from isolated islands of hypolithic cyanobacterial colonization on quartz rocks in soil contact. Communities supported previously unreported polar bacteria and fungi, but archaea were absent from all niches. Lithic community structure did not vary significantly on a landscape scale and stochastic moisture input due to snowmelt resulted in increases in colonization frequency without significantly affecting diversity. The findings show that biodiversity near the cold-arid limit for life is more complex than previously appreciated, but communities lack variability probably due to the high selective pressures of this extreme environment.},

  abstract={Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and bulk carbon isotope determinations have been performed on samples ('cemented organic residues', charcoal, sediment and fire-cracked rock) excavated from 12 slab-lined pits from various locations in Arctic Norway to test the premise that these archaeological features were used for the extraction of oil from the blubber of marine mammals, such as seal, whale and walrus. A wide range of lipid compound classes were detected especially in the cemented organic residues and in the charcoal samples. The presence of long-chain unsaturated and isoprenoid fatty acids together with oxidation and thermal alteration products of unsaturated acids such as dicarboxylic acids, dihydroxyfatty acids and ω-(o-alkylphenyl)alkanoic acids suggests that these features were used for marine oil extraction at elevated temperatures. Notably the location of the hydroxyl groups in the dihydroxyfatty acids provides a record of the positional isomer of the precursor fatty acid and allows confirmation that 11-docosenoic (cetoleic) acid, the most abundant C22:1 isomer in marine oil, was a major component of the original lipid. Further information was provided by the presence of long-chain fatty acyl moieties in surviving triacylglycerols and the presence of cholesterol. A fungal metabolite, mycose (trehalose), was found in all samples apart from a fire-cracked rock and points to microbiological activity in the pits. Bulk isotope analysis conducted on the 'cemented organic residues' is consistent with modern reference samples of blubber and oil from seal and whale. These data provide clear analytical evidence of the function of slab-lined pits in the archaeological record and suggest widespread exploitation of marine mammals for producing oil for heating, lighting and myriad other uses in the past. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract={Mycorrhizal symbiosis is generally advantageous for plants in nutrient-poor soils, but this advantage may be low in arcto-alpine conditions. While the relative coverage of nonmycorrhizal plant species has been found to increase along an altitudinal gradient, the within-species patterns of mycorrhizal colonization in arctic and alpine plants are not well known, and different results have been obtained in relation to altitude. We investigated arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark-septate endophytic (DSE) root colonization in six subarctic herbaceous plants Ranunculus glacialis L., Saxifraga aizoides L., Sibbaldia procumbens L., Solidago virgaurea L., Trientalis europaea L., and Viola biflora L. along an altitudinal gradient (0-1400 m a.s.l.) at Mt. Paras, North Norway. We did not find any consistent decline in the different types of fungus colonization along the entire gradient. There was no statistically significant shift in coarse AM or DSE colonization with altitude. However, fine endophyte type AM colonization showed a statistically significant, positive relationship with altitude. These results suggest that root colonization of any particular mycorrhizal species may yield different gradient patterns with altitude than the relative coverages of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plant taxa. Because of its positive association with altitude, fine endophyte colonization may have a specific role in the nutrition of arctic and alpine plants.},

Compared to the other samples acquired in Arctic and Antarctic, which are different from that of ours, the microbial diversity in our sediment is much higher. The bacterial sequences were grouped into 11 major lineages of the domain Bacteria: Proteobacteria (include α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ε-Proteobacteria); Bacteroidetes; Fusobacteria; Firmicutes; Chloroflexi; Chlamydiae; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Planctomycetes; Verrucomicrobiae and Lentisphaerae. Crenarchaeota were dominant in the archaeal clones containing inserts. In addition, six groups from eukaryotes including Cercozoa, Fungi, Telonema, Stramenopiles, Alveolata, and Metazoa were identified. Remarkably, the novel group Lentisphaerae was reported in Arctic sediment at the first time.

We investigated the mycorrhizal community structure of a polar shrub willow (Salix polaris) and the microbial turnover in its rhizosphere to explore the adaptation of a mycorrhizal plant in the subarctic tundra. The ectomycorrhizal colonisation ranged from 35 to 64% of the fine root tips and decreased with an increasing soil C/N ratio. In total, 16 ectomycorrhizal morphotypes were found under S. polaris (eight to 13 morphotypes per site, five morphotypes at all four sites). Cenococcum sp. was the most common EM fungus (32% of the ectomycorrhizal fine roots). The abundance of Cenococcum sp. increased with an increasing organic matter content and N/P ratio in the soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation of S. polaris was absent or less than 1% of the fine root length. Microbial biomass P accounted for 21-75% of the organic soil P and 6-49% of the total soil P. Microbial biomass P, alkaline and acid phosphatase activities in the rhizosphere increased with increasing soil N concentration. We conclude that a higher N supply decreases the diversity in the mycorrhizal community on polar willows and increases the role of P turnover from the soil microbial biomass for the nutrient supply. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

  abstract={Distribution, species composition and possibilities of germination of the propagule bank of moss in Antarctic soils were investigated by cultural experiments. Soil samples were collected in the Yukidori Valley. Antarctica, and were incubated under laboratory conditions. After several weeks, fungi, algae and mosses were observed in the samples. The dominant species within the germinated moss shoots was Bryum pseudotriquetrum s.lat.; in fact, this species was the only moss species at the study site. Shoots of Ceratodon purpureus and Pottia heimii appeared rarely in the general area, but were not observed at all at the study site. Vegetative propagules such as fragments of shoots were frequently found in the soils, most of the germinated shoots sprouted from such propagules. These propagules were thought to be important for colonization at the site. A relatively large number of shoots of B. pseudotriquetrum appeared from the samples collected from the ground near the vegetation. Most of the propagules of B. pseudotriquetrum in the soils were thought to be dispersed from nearly communities, whereas some propagules such as C. purpureus and P. heimii were thought to be dispersed from more distant moss communities.},

  abstract={We tested the effects of solar radiation, and UV-B in particular, on the growth of Antarctic terrestrial fungi. The growth responses to solar radiation of five fungi, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum, Pythium sp., Verticillium sp., and Mortierella parvispora, each isolated from Antarctic terrestrial habitats, were examined on an agar medium in the natural Antarctic environment. A 3-h exposure to solar radiation of >287 nm reduced the hyphal extension rates of all species relative to controls kept in the dark. Pythium sp. cultures exposed to solar radiation for 1.5 h on five consecutive days were most sensitive to radiation of >287 nm, but radiation of >313 nm also inhibited growth to a lesser extent. Radiation of >400 nm had no effect on hyphal growth relative to controls kept in the dark. Short-wave solar UV-B radiation of between 287 and 305 nm inhibited the growth of Pythium sp. hyphae on and below the surface of the agar medium after 24 h, but radiation of ≥345 nm only reduced the growth of surface hyphae. Similar detrimental effects of UV-B on surface and, to a lesser extent, submerged hyphae of all five fungi were shown in the laboratory by using artificial UV-B from fluorescent lamps. A comparison of growth responses to solar radiation and temperature showed that the species that were most resistant to UV radiation grew fastest at higher temperatures. These data suggest that solar UV-B reduces the growth of fungi on the soil surface in the Antarctic terrestrial environment.},

  abstract={We analysed and compared the functioning of UV-B screening pigments in plants from marine, fresh water and terrestrial ecosystems, along the evolutionary line of cyanobacteria, unicellular algae, primitive multicellular algae, charophycean algae, lichens, mosses and higher plants, including amphibious macrophytes. Lichens were also included in the study. We were interested in the following key aspects: (a) does the water column function effectively as an 'external UV-B filter'?; (b) do aquatic plants need less 'internal UV-B screening' than terrestrial plants?; (c) what role does UV screening play in protecting the various plant groups from UV-B damage, such as the formation of thymine dimers?; and (d) since early land 'plants' (such as the predecessors of present-day cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses) experienced higher UV-B fluxes than higher plants, which evolved later, are primitive aquatic and land organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, mosses) better adapted to present-day levels of UV-B than higher plants? Furthermore, polychromatic action spectra for the induction of UV screening pigments of aquatic organisms have been determined. This is relevant for translating 'physical' radiation measurements of solar UV-B into 'biological' and 'ecological' effects. From the action spectra, radiation amplification factors (RAFs) have been calculated. These action spectra allow us to determine any mitigating or antagonistic effects in the ecosystems and therefore qualify the damage prediction for the ecosystems under study. We summarize and discuss the main results based on three years of research of four European research groups. The central theme of the work was the investigation of the effectiveness of the various screening compounds from the different species studied in order to gain some perspective of the evolutionary adaptations from lower to higher plant forms. The induction of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) was studied in the marine dinoflagellate Gyrodinium dorsum, the green algal species Prasiola stipitata and in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. While visible (400-700 nm) and long wavelength UV-A (315-400 nm) showed only a slight effect, MAAs were effectively induced by UV-B (280-315 nm). The growth of the lower land organisms studied, i.e. the lichens Cladina portentosa, Cladina foliacaea and Cladonia arbuscula, and the club moss Lycopodiumannotinum, was not significantly reduced when grown under elevated UV-B radiation (simulating 15% ozone depletion). The growth in length of the moss Tortula ruralis was reduced under elevated UV-B. Of the aquatic plants investigated the charophytes Chara aspera showed decreased longitudinal growth under elevated UV-B. In the 'aquatic higher plants' studied, Ceratophyllum demersum, Batrachium trichophyllum and Potamogeton alpinus, there was no such depressed growth with enhanced UV-B. In Chara aspera, neither MAAs nor flavonoids could be detected. Of the terrestrial higher plants studied. Fagopyrum esculentum, Deschampsia antarctica, Vicia faba, Calamagrostis epigejos and Carex arenaria, the growth of the first species was depressed with enhanced UV-B, in the second species length growth was decreased, but the shoot number was increased, and in the latter two species of a dune grassland there was no reduced growth with enhanced UV-B. In the dune grassland species studied outdoors, at least five different flavonoids appeared in shoot tissue. Some of the flavonoids in the monocot species, which were identified and quantified with HPLC, included orientin, luteolin, tricin and apigenin. A greenhouse study with Vicia faba showed that two flavonoids (aglycones) respond particularly to enhanced UV-B. Of these, quercetin is UV-B inducible and mainly located in epidermal cells, while kaempferol occurs constitutively. In addition to its UV-screening function, quercetin may also act as an antioxidant. Polychromatic action spectra were determined for induction of the UV-absorbing pigments in three photosynthetic organisms, representing very different taxonomic groups and different habitats. In ultraviolet photobiology, action spectra mainly serve two purposes: (1) identification of the molecular species involved in light absorption; and (2) calculation of radiation amplification factors for assessing the effect of ozone depletion. Radiation amplification factors (RAFs) were calculated from the action spectra. In a somewhat simplified way, RAF can be defined as the percent increase of radiation damage for a 1% depletion of the ozone layer. Central European summer conditions were used in the calculations, but it has been shown that RAF values are not critically dependent on latitude or season. If only the ultraviolet spectral region is considered, the RAF values obtained are 0.7 for the green alga Prasiola stipitata, 0.4 for the dinoflagellate Gyrodinium dorsum, and 1.0 for the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. In the case of P. stipitata, however, the effect of visible light (PAR, photosynthetically active radiation, 400-700 nm) is sufficient to lower the RAF to about 0.4, while the PAR effect for G. dorsum is negligible. RAFs for some damage processes, such as for DNA damage (RAF=2.1 if protective effects or photorepair are not considered [1]), are higher than those above. Our interpretation of this is that if the ozone layer is depleted, increased damaging radiation could overrule increased synthesis of protective pigments. In addition to investigating the functional effectiveness of the different screening compounds, direct UV effects on a number of key processes were also studied in order to gain further insight into the ability of the organisms to withstand enhanced UV-B radiation. To this end, the temperature-dependent repair of cyclobutane dimers (CPD) and (6-4) photoproducts induced by enhanced UV-B was studied in Nicotiana tabacum, and the UV-B induction of CPD was studied in the lichen Cladonia arbuscula [2]. Also, photosynthesis and motility were monitored and the response related to the potential function of the screening compounds of the specific organism. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract={The filamentous fungus Phoma herbarum CCFEE 5080 isolated from continental Antarctica soil was tested for exopolysaccharide (EPS) production. The fungus grew and produced EPS (up to13.6 g/l) on a variety of carbon sources among which sorbitol was best, particularly at the concentration of 60 g/l. EPS production was maximum when the nitrogen source was NaNO3 (3 g/l) and the incubation temperature was 28°C. The polysaccharide was purified by repeated precipitation in ethanol and gel filtration and characterized as a homopolymer of glucose having a molecular weight of 7.412×106; structural analysis indicated the presence of β-1,3 and β-1,6 linkages only. After repeated freezing and thawing of the fungal biomass in the presence of EPS, the mycelial growth was much higher than that observed after freezing in the absence of EPS and the difference increased with the number of freeze-thaw cycles. It is hypothesized that the adaptation of P. herbarum CCFEE 5080 to the Antarctic soil microclimatic conditions, characterized by low temperature, high thermal fluctuations and repeated freeze-thaw cycles, might be related to the EPS production ability. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

These include several sequences highly similar to known plant-associated microbes, including Pseudomonas fluorescens, Xanthomonas sacchari, and Pseudozyma antarctica, as well as to several uncultured bacteria. In addition, one sequence shows significant similarity to the sequence of Fusarium graminearum, a potent pathogenic fungus in foodstuffs that produces trichothecene mycotoxins.

  abstract={Dark septate root endophytes (DSE) are conidial or sterile fungi (Deuteromycotina, Fungi Imperfecti) likely to be ascomycetous and colonizing plant roots. They have been reported for nearly 600 plant species representing about 320 genera and 100 families. DSE fungi occur from the tropics to arctic and alpine habitats and comprise a heterogeneous group that functionally and ecologically overlaps with soil fungi, saprotrophic rhizoplane-inhabiting fungi, obligately and facultatively pathogenic fungi and mycorrhizal fungi. Numerous species of undescribed sterile and anamorphic taxa may also await discovery. Although DSE are abundant in washed root and soil samples from various habitats, and are easily isolated from surface-sterilized roots of ecto-, ectendo-, endo- and non-mycorrhizal host species, their ecological functions are little understood. Studies of DSE thus far have yielded inconsistent results and only poorly illustrate the role of DSE in their natural habitats. These inconsistencies are largely due to the uncertain taxonomic affinities of the strains of DSE used. In addition, because different strains of a single anamorph taxon seem to vary greatly in function, no clear generalizations on their ecological role have been drawn. This paper reviews the current literature on DSE and the ecology and discusses the need for and direction of future research.},

  abstract={Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae, together with bacteria and fungi, are known to be primary colonizers of mineral soils throughout Antarctica. Their species diversity and soil coverage were studied in 18 soil polygons located at Cierva Point, Antarctic Peninsula. Undisturbed assemblages were dominated by filamentous Cyanobacteria and diatoms, whilst almost 40% of the 49 species recorded were observed only after enrichment culture. Nearly all of the isolates from enrichment cultures were Chlorophyta and Tribophyceae. This revealed a higher degree of complexity than reported for similar communities on Signy Island. Water content and concentrations of nutrients were determined at four representative sites, and did not appear to account for the large inter-polygon variation found in species composition and relative frequencies of occurrence. Variables describing community development were not significantly correlated with either area of the polygons or the minimum distance between them. This suggested that these features are not an important short-range barrier to dispersal for those 'weed' species dominating the community. Conversely, the relative frequencies of some of the most common species showed significant correlations with species diversity and soil coverage, and it is suggested that biotic interactions could account to a larger extent for community structure than previously reported from Signy Island fellfields.},

  abstract={Increase in the synthesis of membrane-fluidizing (such as unsaturated) fatty acids in cold-adapted bacteria is well documented. More recently, a polar carotenoid was found to rigidify synthetic membranes in an in vitro study. Enhanced biosynthesis of some fatty acids that increase membrane fuidity, and also of polar carotenoids has been evidenced in one Gram-positive and one Gram-negative psychrotrophic bacterium, isolated from Antarctic soil. A role of carotenoids in homeoviscous adaptation of membrane fluidity has been postulated. Antarctic microorganisms provide an attractive model for studies on biological aspects of cold adaptation. Several clues to the understanding of the mechanism of cold-adaptation have been obtained from investigations on some psychrotrophic bacterial strains, isolated from the Schirmacher oasis of Antarctica (see references in Chattopadhyay 2000). Lowering of temperature leads to the formation of a close array of acyl chains of fatty acids in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. The resultant restriction of molecular motion imposes a gelling effect on the lipid bilayer. Under this stress condition, maintenance of an optimum membrane fluidity becomes a crucial challenge for the microorganisms in survival at low temperature. Studies on other cold-adapted bacteria have revealed several strategies adopted by the microorganisms to maintain the cell membrane within a narrow range of viscosity or within a liquid crystalline phase. Conversion of saturated fatty acids into unsaturated fatty acids (which have a fluidizing effect on the membrane) by cold-inducible desaturases is well known. Other mechanisms of maintaining an optimum fluidity involve reduction in the acyl chain length and synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids (Suutari and Laakso 1994; Klein et al. 1999). It was observed that when two strains of Listeria monocytogenes were grown at low temperature, there was a dominance of anteiso pentadecanoic acid in the fatty acid production profile. In two coldsensitive mutants, a marked deficiency of this branched chain fatty acid was also evidenced (Annous et al. 1997). Bacteria in the deep-sea environment are adapted to high pressure and low temperature. Recently, the importance of monounsaturated fatty acids for growth has been demonstrated in a deep-sea isolate of Photo-bacterium (Allen et al. 1999). Carotenoid pigments, present in a wide variety of bacteria, algae, fungi and plants, have been shown to play important biological roles (Bramley and MacKenzie 1988). In photosynthetic bacteria, they help in harvesting light energy as accessory antenna pigment (Siefirmann-Harms 1985) and in protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against photodynamic killing (Wloch and Wieckowski 1982; Krinsky 1989; Sandmann el al. 1993). In non-photosynthetic bacteria, they provide protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Goodwin 1980; Becker-Hapak et al. 1997). They are known to protect the neighbouring biomolecules against oxidative damage (Di Mascio et al. 1989; Miller et al. 1996). They also stabilize the native conformation of functional pigment proteins (Kuhlbrandt et al. 1994; Moskalenko and Karapetyan 1996). Possible role of carotenoids in regulation of membrane fluidity was demonstrated earlier in some in vitro studies (Subczynski et al. 1992; Gabrielska and Gruszecki 1996). In bacterial systematics, carotenoids are useful as important chemotaxonomic markers (Holmes et al. 1984; Kocur 1986). Bacterial carotenoids are believed to play a similar role as that played by cholesterol in eukaryotic cells as a membrane-spanning agent (Rohmer et al. 1979; Subczynski et al. 1992). In our laboratory, studies on the bacterial species of Antarctica revealed a preponderance of pigmented bacteria (Sarita and Shivaji 1994). During subcellular fractionation, the pigments were always found to be associated with the membranes (Jagannadham et al. 1991, 1996a, 1996b). Hence it appeared worthwhile to look into the possible role(s) of the pigments in regulation of membrane fluidity at low temperature. It was shown that a psychrotrophic strain of Micrococcus roseus (MTCC 678, IMTECH, Chandigarh, India) obtained from Antarctic soil synthesized β-carotene, haloxanthin, monoanhydrobacterioruberin, bacterioruberin and glycosides of bacterioruberin (Chattopadhyay et al. 1997; Strand et al. 1997). Further studies on temperature-dependent carotenogenesis revealed higher yield of polar carotenoids at low temperature, compared to the production of non-polar carotenoids (Chattopadhyay et al. 1997). The major pigments of Sphingobacterium antarcticus, another Antarctic psychrotroph (MTCC 675, Chandigarh, India), were found to be β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin (Jagannadham et al. 2000). In vitro studies performed earlier revealed that polar carotenoids decreased the fluidity of the synthetic membranes when maintained above their phase transition temperature. In contrast, when membranes were incubated below their phase transition temperature, fluidity was found to be increased (Subczynski et al. 1992). The structure of the individual carotenoids is decisive for the effect on membrane fluidity (Gabrielska and Gruszecki 1996; Jagannadham 1999). In another study it was shown that carotenoids interacted with membranes and rigidifled them. The interaction was found to be dependent on the degree of desaturation and also on the length of the lipid alkyl chains (Subczynski et al. 1993). In the Antarctic psychrotroph S. antarcticus, the synthesis of the polar carotenoid zeaxanthin increased whereas the content of the apolar β-carotene decreased when the bacterium was grown at low temperature (5°C), compared to the cells grown at 25°C. Simultaneously, an enhanced synthesis of membrane fluidizing fatty acids (branched-chain and unsaturated fatty acids) was evidenced when the psychrotroph was grown at a lower temperature. Similar phenomena were observed in another psychrotroph, M. roseus. The synthesis of bacterioruberin glycosides (more polar) increased whereas the synthesis of free bacterioruberin and monoanhydrobacterioruberin (less polar) decreased in cells grown at low temperature, compared to the cells grown at high temperature (Chattopadhyay et al. 1997). Synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids was also enhanced when the two organisms were grown at lower temperature (Jagannadham 1998; Jagannadham et al. 2000). Using an external fluorophore it was shown that membrane fluidity of S. antarcticus cells grown at 5°C and 25°C did not undergo significant change (Jagannadham et al. 2000). Hence these findings suggest that homeoviscous adaptation of membrane fluidity (Sinensky 1974) in Antarctic bacteria at low temperature is ensured by enhanced biosynthesis of some fatty acids that increase membrane fluidity, and a counterbalancing increase in the biosynthesis of polar carotenoids that decrease membrane fluidity. Earlier, carotenoids were shown to depress the phase transition temperature of synthetic lipids (Subczynski et al. 1992, 1993) and this effect was dependent on the concentration of the pigment (Chaturvedi and Kurup 1986; Subczynski et al. 1992; Strzalka and Gruszecki 1994). The present investigation demonstrates that carotenoids may have a role in fine tuning the regulation of membrane fluidity, which has hitherto been known to be governed by fatty acids.},

  abstract={Resin acids are tricyclic terpenoids occurring naturally in trees. We investigated the occurrence of resin acid-degrading bacteria on the Arctic tundra near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island (82°N, 62°W). According to most-probable-number assays, resin acid degraders were abundant (103 to 104 propagules/g of soil) in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, but they were undetectable (<3 propagules/g of soil) in pristine soils from the nearby tundra. Plate counts indicated that the contaminated and the pristine soils had similar populations of heterotrophs (106 to 107 propagules/g of soil). Eleven resin acid-degrading bacteria belonging to four phylogenetically distinct groups were enriched and isolated from the contaminated soils, and representative isolates of each group were further characterized. Strains DhA-91, IpA-92, and IpA-93 are members of the genus Pseudomonas. Strain DhA-95 is a member of the genus Sphingomonas. All four strains are psychrotolerant, with growth temperature ranges of 4°C to 30°C (DhA-91 and DhA-95) or 4°C to 22°C (IpA-92 and IpA-93) and with optimum temperatures of 15 to 22°C. Strains DhA-91 and DhA-95 grew on the abietanes, dehydroabietic and abietic acids, but not on the pimaranes, isopimaric and pimaric acids. Strains IpA-92 and IpA-93 grew on the pimaranes but not the abietanes. All four strains grew on either aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, which is unusual for described resin acid degraders. Eleven mesophilic resin acid degraders did not use hydrocarbons, with the exception of two Mycobacterium sp. strains that used aliphatic hydrocarbons. We conclude that hydrocarbon contamination in Arctic tundra soil indirectly selected for resin acid degraders, selecting for hydrocarbon degraders that coincidentally use resin acids. Psychrotolerant resin acid degraders are likely important in the global carbon cycle and may have applications in biotreatment of pulp and paper mill effluents.},

  abstract={Nutrient availability is a major constraint on plant production and carbon storage in arctic ecosystems but knowledge on the decomposer food web interactions and their effect on nutrient cycling is scarce. We manipulated the soil food web at two contrasting subarctic sites, a low altitude heath and a high altitude fell-field. The influx of nutrients and energy in the soil was increased by addition of fertiliser nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and of labile carbon (sugar). In addition, two bactericides (penicillin and streptomycin) and a fungicide (benomyl) were applied to manipulate the bacterial and fungal component of the soil. Experiments were carried out in a factorial design with repeated additions over four growing seasons. The present study investigated the nematode fauna and the effects of the manipulations on the abundance of nematode species. Fertilisation resulted in an increase of general opportunists, especially Aphelenchoides. Application of carbon or bactericides had only minor impact on the nematode community. In contrast, the fungicide was very toxic to non-target organisms and greatly reduced the abundance of most nematode species, although Acrobeloides buetschlii showed tolerance and greatly increased in number. At both sites, Eudorylaimus was most affected by the treatments. Generally the manipulations performed resulted in a significant increase in stress tolerant or competitive dominant nematode species.},

  abstract={Mycorrhizal associations are generally favourable for vascular plants in nutrient-poor conditions. Still, non-mycorrhizal plants are common in high arctic and alpine areas, which are often poor in nitrogen and phosphorus. The relative proportion of mycorrhizal plants has been found to decrease along with increasing altitude, suggesting that the advantage of the mycorrhizal symbiosis may change along an altitudinal gradient. This may be related to the environmental factors that possibly constrain the amount of photosynthesized carbon to be shared with mycorrhizal fungi. We propose a simple optimization model for root colonization by fungal symbionts and analyze the advantages of mycorrhizas in relation to the nutrient use efficiency of photosynthesis (PNUE), the kinetics of nutrient uptake and the soil nutrient levels. Our model suggests that mycorrhizas are not usually favoured at low PNUE values. At low nutrient levels, mycorrhizas may be advantageous if they have a lower threshold concentration of nutrient uptake (xmin) compared to non-mycorrhizal roots. If mycorrhizal roots have a higher maximum capacity of nutrient uptake (Vmax), mycorrhizas can be favourable for the host plant even at relatively low nutrient concentrations and at relatively low PNUE. Consequently, the possible patterns along altitudinal gradients essentially depend on PNUE. If the soil nutrient concentration is constant and PNUE decreases, the advantage of mycorrhizal symbiosis declines independently of the nutrient uptake kinetics. If PNUE remains constant and the soil nutrient concentration decreases along with increasing altitude, the emerging colonization pattern (either increasing, decreasing or intermediate) depends on the nutrient uptake kinetics. Additionally, if both PNUE and the soil nutrient concentration decrease, several patterns may emerge, depending on the nutrient uptake kinetics.},

  abstract={Critical consideration of varied Phanerozoic climatic models, and comparison of them against Phanerozoic global climatic gradients revealed by a compilation of Cambrian through Miocene climatically sensitive sediments (evaporites, coals, tillites, lateritic soils, bauxites, calcretes, etc.) suggests that the previously postulated climatic models do not satisfactorily account for the geological information. Nor do many climatic conclusions based on botanical data stand up very well when examined critically. Although this account does not deal directly with global biogeographic information, another powerful source of climatic information, we have tried to incorporate such data into our thinking wherever possible, particularly in the earlier Paleozoic. In view of the excellent correlation between CO2 present in Antarctic ice cores, going back some hundreds of thousands of years, and global climatic gradient, one wonders whether or not the commonly postulated Phanerozoic connection between atmospheric CO2 and global climatic gradient is more coincidence than cause and effect. Many models have been proposed that attempt to determine atmospheric composition and global temperature through geological time, particularly for the Phanerozoic or significant portions of it. Many models assume a positive correlation between atmospheric CO2 and surface temperature, thus viewing changes in atmospheric CO2 as playing the critical role in regulating climate/temperature, but none agree on the levels of atmospheric CO2 through time. Prior to the relatively recent interval of time in which atmospheric CO2 is directly measurable, a variety of biological and geological proxies have been proposed to correlate with atmospheric CO2 level or with pCO2/temperature. Atmospheric models may be constructed for the Pre-Cenozoic but the difficulties of assessing variables in their construction are many and complex. None of the modelers have gathered enough biological and geological data to impart reliability to the model constructs. Most modelers focus almost exclusively on one or a few variables as proxy to measure atmospheric CO2, nor consider the many other variables involved, nor agree on what these variables are or how to measure them. In this paper, it is the reliability of the present data bases used in these atmospheric models that we wish to consider. We focus most attention on the Berner models, such as GEOCARB I, II and BLAG, because of the basic role they attribute to tracheophytes in regulating atmospheric CO2 and our own interest in pre-tracheophytic land plants and the atmospheric composition of the pre-tracheophytic Paleozoic. We survey the presence of symbiotic mycorrhizae and question the assumption that all tracheophytes are obligately associated with them. Although pre-tracheophytic embryophytes, cyanobacteria, and possibly other organisms preceded tracheophytes on land by millions of years, Berner's models do not consider a significant role for them in affecting pre-Devonian climate/temperature and atmospheric composition. In effect, Berner assumes that pre-tracheophytic life inhabited a world governed largely by abiotic physical and chemical reactions. We consider uncertainties raised by minimizing possible roles for pretracheophytic oxygenic and heterotrophic microorganisms analogous to those speculated to be unique to tracheophytes both with regard to an active role in biodeterioration of rock and soil mineral substrates and in the sequestration of organic carbon. Additionally, Berner does not consider marine productivity, which might have been high in the Precambrian and Early Paleozoic and possibly consequent organic carbon sequestration, even in the possible absence of terrestrial organisms, or even in the absence of a significant preserved biomass of terrestrial and marine organisms. The important roles played by cyanobacteria, for example, are briefly reviewed by Giller and Malmqvist in lakes and rivers as regards both planktonic and benthic taxa, and it is not safe to assume that these organisms were absent or of no potential significance in the pre-embryophytic, i.e. earlier Ordovician and well back into the Precambrian. Berner's models have met with a large measure of consensus about CO2 balance during the Phanerozoic, about the role played by tracheophytes, and have been used to test or evaluate other data. After reviewing the biological and geological assumptions and estimates on which these Models are based, we conclude that they do not provide reliable information about atmospheric CO2 composition through Phanerozoic time, particularly in the Early Phanerozoic. We compare many atmospheric CO2 models, while considering the numerous proxies on which they are based and conclude that the competing models are inadequate for atmospheric CO2 estimation. Many possibilities not considered in present models must either be included or eliminated based on reliable evidence. We suggest that assessing Phanerozoic climate/temperature based on the available geological/climatic proxies would appear to provide a more reliable method of estimating variations in CO2, and hence atmospheric CO2:O2 balance, than most proxy constructs on which atmospheric models are presently based, because of the critical role postulated for atmospheric CO2 in regulating Earth's surface temperature. We present our own Phanerozoic climate estimate, based on readily available geological/climatic data, for comparison with postulated coeval atmospheric CO2 levels as a test of the postulated correlation. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In 37 of the hydrolysates, Aib was detected, and in several of them D-Iva or mixtures of D- and L-Iva. Non-proteinogenic Aib, in particular, is a highly specific marker for a distinctive group of fungal polypeptides named peptaibols or, comprehensively, peptaibiotics, i.e., peptides containing Aib and displaying (anti)biotic activities. The biotic synthesis of these amino acids by filamentous fungi contradicts the still widespread belief that α,α-dialkyl-α-amino acids do not or rarely occur in the biosphere and, if detected, are of extraterrestrial origin. The abundant production of peptaibiotics by cosmopolitan species of microfungi has also to be considered in the discussion on the occurrence of Aib and Iva in ancient and recent sediments. The detection of trace amounts of Aib in ice samples of Antarctica that are devoid of meteorites might also be related to the presence of Aib-producing microorganisms, being either indigenous psychrophiles, or being transported and localized by mechanisms related to bioaerosols and cryoconites. The presence of microfungi being capable of producing α,α-dialkyl α-amino acids in terrestrial samples, and possible contamination of extraterrestrial materials are pointed out to be of relevance for the reliable interpretation of cosmogeochemical data. © 2009 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zürich.},

  abstract={Amino sugars in soils are assumed to be of microbial origin. Their levels in soil, can provide insights into the microbial contribution to soil organic matter (SOM) and might serve as an indicator of SOM quality. Four amino sugars, glucosamine, galactosamine, mannosamine, and muramic acid were determined by gas chromatography in five soils from the tundra Alaska before and after incubation for 4 months at 4 and 25°C. Glucosamine and muramic acid analyses were utilized to represent fungal biomass and bacterial biomass, respectively. Total amino sugar N represented 0.8 to 3.3% of the total soil N in these five tundra soils, and the proportion of soil N as amino sugars increased with depth. Total amino sugar and fungal glucosamine N increased or remained constant during incubation at 4 and 25°C (except site 3 Cf horizon which decreased after incubation at 4°C), suggesting that total microbial biomass and fungal biomass increased. Bacterial biomass had an increase after incubation at 4°C, and a relative decrease at 25°C (except for Cf horizon). Fungal glucosamine to muramic acid ratios demonstrated that fungal biomass increased faster than bacterial biomass at 25°C, and slower at 4°C, indicating that at higher temperature, fungi dominated the microbial biomass in the soils studied. The mechanisms involved in the accumulation and decomposition of amino sugars in soil during incubation were not clear. No correlations were observed between the amino sugar contents and CO2 evolution during incubation, indicating that amino sugar abundance may not be an indicator of the bioavailability of SOM in soils. However, they can provide insights into the microbial contribution to SOM.},

Growth responses of Alternaria alternata, Chrysosporium pannorum, Nectria peziza, Thelebolus microsporus, Mycelia sterile and Phoma cf. herbarum to temperature, pH and culture media were investigated. Maximum growth occurred after 16 days, except in Nectria peziza and Thelebolus microsporus, where maximum growth occurred 12 days after inoculation. All isolates showed poor growth at 0°C. Maximum growth was obtained with temperatures ranging from 15 to 25°C. The optimum temperature for all fungi was 20°C. An acid medium favoured growth. Chrysosporium pannorum, Phoma cf. herbarum and Nectria peziza grew best at pH 3-4, whereas Mycelia sterile, Alternaria alternata and Thelebolus microsporus grew best at pH 5-6. The culture medium had little effect on growth, except for nutrient agar, which showed poor growth against all isolates with the exception of Thelebolus microsporus.},

Comparison of the experimental sequences from the different techniques employed with those held online resulted in the repeated recovery of a limited range of related organisms indicating low species diversity of microfungi in these soils. A total of 102 fungal sequences were obtained from FB (37 sequences) and JC (65 sequences) that together were distributed among the Basidiomycota (48 sequences), Ascomycota (48 sequences) and Zygomycota (6 sequences).

  abstract={The Alaskan tussock tundra is a strongly nutrient-limited ecosystem, where almost all vascular plant species are mycorrhizal. We established a long-term removal experiment to document effects of arctic plant species on ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and to investigate whether species interactions and/ or nutrient availability affect mycorrhizal colonization. The treatments applied were removal of Betula nana (Betulaceae, dominant deciduous shrub species), removal of Ledum palustre (Ericaceae, dominant evergreen shrub species), control (no removal), and each of these three treatments with the addition of fertilizer. After 3 years of Ledum removal and fertilization, we found that overall ectomycorrhizal colonization in Betula was significantly reduced. Changes in ectomycorrhizal morphotype composition in removal and fertilized treatments were also observed. These results suggest that the effect of Ledum on Betula's mycorrhizal roots is due to sequestration of nutrients by Ledum, leading to reduced nutrient availability in the soil. In contrast, ericoid mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by fertilization, but the removal of Betula and to a lower degree of Ledum resulted in a reduction of ericoid mycorrhizal colonization suggesting a direct effect of these species on ericoid mycorrhizal colonization. Nutrient availability was only higher in fertilized treatments, but caution should be taken with the interpretation of these data as soil microbes may effectively compete with the ion exchange resins for the nutrients released by plant removal in these nutrient-limited soils.},

  abstract={Soil micromorphology provides an excellent resource for investigating Palaeoeskimo site-formation processes in the low arctic periglacial environment. In this study, micromorphology was used to answer questions concerning the composition, structure, origin and depositional agencies of the Tayara site active layer's sediments as well as to distinguish between natural (geogenic, biopedogenic) and cultural (anthropogenic) processes. Five groups of microfeatures were documented. These include 1) biopedological features (soil organic matter accumulation, mesofaunal and fungal activities), 2) transport-inherited features related to depositional processes (solifluction and stream sedimentation), 3) frost-induced microstructures and cryogenic features such as major post-depositional changes (ice-segregation, particle rearrangement, frost shattering, cryoturbation), 4) bone preservation in the active layer at the microscopic level, and 5) anthropogenic features related to Palaeoeskimo activities. The sediments from the three archaeological levels (I, IA and II) appear to have been very little influenced by anthropogenic factors. Cultural processes are micromorphologically observed in level II, with some evidence of feeding (bone presence), burning (wood charcoal, heated bone), and possibly trampling. However, the effects of natural processes on the sediments are more pronounced than anthropogenic ones. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Saprotrophic filamentous microfungi were isolated by means of the soil dilution method from soil samples collected from four locations in the Bellsund region of Spitsbergen (77°33′N, 14°31′E) representing the following forms of surface micro-relief: an old stormbank, a sorted circle, a frost fissure between tundra polygons, and the central part of a tundra polygon. The fungal isolates were identified and screened for their ability to grow at low temperatures. The oligotrophy of psychrophilic and psychrotrophic strains was then determined as the ability of growth on silica gel without a C source added. Differences in some physico-chemical properties were found between the soils sampled from the four sites. A total of 89 taxa from 17 genera were isolated. Most of the isolates were species of Mortierella, Penicillium, Chrysosporium and Phialophora, and half of them were psychrophiles. Fungal communities isolated from a frost fissure between tundra polygons (site 3) and from the central part of a tundra polygon (site 4) were dominated by psychrophiles but those isolated from an old stormbank (site 1) and a sorted circle (site 2) were predominantly psychrotrophic. Oligopsychrophilic taxa accounted for 27% and oligopsychrotrophic for 20% of all the isolated taxa but only from 0.7% to 11.7% and from 1.2% to 6.3% of the total number of cfu (colony forming unit) isolated from an individual site, respectively. The results of the present study suggest that the abundance of fungi in Arctic soil is mostly affected by the content of organic matter in the A horizon and the plant cover, but other factors, such as the stage of soil development and the micro-relief of the surface, are more important for species richness of fungal communities.},

  keywords={Biodiversity, Geographical distribution, Habitats, Inhibition competition, Salinity, Substrata, Temperature},
  abstract={This paper reviews some of the factors that affect fungal diversity in the marine milieu. Although total biodiversity is not affected by the available habitats, species composition is. For example, members of the Halosphaeriales commonly occur on submerged timber, while intertidal mangrove wood supports a wide range of Loculoascomycetes. The availability of substrata for colonization greatly affects species diversity. Mature mangroves yield a rich species diversity while exposed shores or depauperate habitats support few fungi. The availability of fungal propagules in the sea on substratum colonization is poorly researched. However, Halophytophthora species and thraustochytrids in mangroves rapidly colonize leaf material. Fungal diversity is greatly affected by the nature of the substratum. Lignocellulosic materials yield the greatest diversity, in contrast to a few species colonizing calcareous materials or sand grains. The nature of the substratum can have a major effect on the fungi colonizing it, even from one timber species to the next. Competition between fungi can markedly affect fungal diversity, and species composition. Temperature plays a major role in the geographical distribution of marine fungi with species that are typically tropical (e.g. Antennospora quadricornuta and Halosarpheia ratnagiriensis), temperate (e.g. Ceriosporopsis trullifera and Ondiniella torquata), arctic (e.g. Spathulospora antartica and Thraustochytrium antarticum), while others are cosmopolitan (e.g. Ceriosporopsis halima and Lignincola laevis). Salinity is also important in affecting species composition. Many fungi occur primarily in fully saline waters (e.g. Lindra inflata and Ondiniella torquata), others are more frequent in brackish water (e.g. Amylocarpus encephaloides and Aniptodera chesapeakenis), while terrestrial and freshwater species may be able to grow at lower salinities (e.g. Chytridium citriforme, Saprolegnia ferax and Stachybotrys atra). In mangroves many species (e.g. Halophytophthora species), can tolerate great variation in salinity of the water. Some marine fungi are common in occurrence (e.g. Ceriosporopsis halima, Lulworthia spp., and Zalerion maritimum in temperate waters, and Antennospora salina, A. quadricornuata and Lulworthia grandispora in the tropics), while others are rarely collected (e.g. Orbimyces spectabilis and Torpedospora ambispinosa). For the latter group this may be due to seasonality (e.g. Mycaureola dilsea on Dilsea edulis) or have a specific temperature requirements (e.g. Digitatispora marina occurring during the winter months when water temperatures are below 10 C). For other species there is no apparent reason to explain their infrequent occurrence. A plethora of factors may govern the occurrence of marine fungi in a particular habitat or on a substratum. Many are subject to a consortium of factors operating together in controlling the biodiversity of fungi in the sea.},

  abstract={Microorganisms inhabiting terrestrial endolithic habitats are widespread in polar environments including the Antarctic Dry Valleys and the Canadian high Arctic. Their ability to survive in these harsh environments is a result of their finding protection from extremes in temperature, aridity, radiation and winds by colonizing nutrient-rich subsurface habitats that provide more amenable conditions for growth, often developing as vertically stratified communities that include fungi, algae, cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. Despite finding some refuge from climatic extremes, endolithic microorganisms commonly produce extracellular polysaccharides to avoid desiccation and minimize the damaging effects of freeze-thaw cycles. These microorganisms are geochemically reactive with their endolithic surroundings, observed as heterogeneous concentrations and distributions of metals resulting from mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions as well as element and nutrient release and cycling. Novel microscopy techniques such as SEM-BSE reveal much information about the physiological state of these microorganisms in situ, and show how under specific conditions, microbe-mineral interactions produce unique biosignatures of interest to studies in astrobiology. Their ability to change in situ pH conditions shows that can be directly involved in weathering of endolithic habitats, but the ecology of a given endolithic microbial community can have varying effects on rates of rock weathering. These differences in weathering rates may be an important control on microbial species diversity in polar desert endolithic habitats.},

  abstract={Dwarf shrub heaths are common vegetation types of the Arctic and Subarctic. Some of the dominant plants in these communities release toxic substances which can affect neighbouring plants. We investigated the effects of leaf extracts from two dwarf shrubs, Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum hermaphroditum, and from mountain birch, Betula pubescens spp. tortuosa, on nematode community structure and reproduction in a pot and an agar culture experiment. In pots two graminoids, Carex bigelowii and Festuca vivipara, were grown in previously sterilized or non-sterilized soil. Soil was collected from a subarctic heath, and plants from a fellfield site, near Abisko, northern Swedish Lapland. The naturally occurring nematode community at the heath site is also described. A total of 34 nematode taxa were observed at the field site and 32 taxa in the pot experiment. Most species, especially frequent taxa, occurred in both soils. Potted soil was strongly dominated by bacterial feeders and showed a shift towards a more colonizer controlled population. These changes were presumably due to the establishment of residual species after freezing and/or sterilization of the soil prior to incubation in the laboratory. Direct exposure of the nematode Aphelenchoides saprophilus to the leaf extracts in agar cultures resulted in a lower reproduction rate. Leaf extract treatment in potted soil altered nematode species composition and dominance structure, and generally reduced species number and maturity index. The diversity of genera was decreased by all extract treatments in pots with Carex. Nematode population density was not affected, except after application of Betula extracts, where significantly higher densities occurred. Nematode data were related to respiration and active fungal biomass in the soil, indicating that rather than allelochemicals with nematicidal properties, carbohydrates in the leaf extracts promoting a beneficial microflora may have affected the nematode community. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract={Microorganisms play a dominant role in Antarctic ecosystems, yet little is known about how fungal diversity differs at sites with considerable human activity as compared to those that are remote and relatively pristine. Ross Island, Antarctica is the site of three historic expedition huts left by early explorers to the South Pole, Robert F. Scott and Ernest Shackleton. The fungal diversity of these wooden structures and surrounding soils was investigated with traditional culturing methods as well as with molecular methodology including denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA for identification. From historic wood and artifact samples and soils adjacent to the huts as well as soil samples obtained from the Lake Fryxell Basin, a remote Dry Valley location, and remote sites at Mt. Fleming and the Allan Hills, 71 fungal taxa were identified. The historic huts and associated artifacts have been colonized and degraded by fungi to various extents. The most frequently isolated fungal genera from the historic woods sampled include Cadophora, Cladosporium and Geomyces. Similar genera were found in soil samples collected near the huts. Sampling of soils from locations in the Transantarctic Mountains and Lake Fryxell Basin at considerable distances from the huts and with different soil conditions revealed Cryptococcus spp., Epicoccum nigrum and Cladosporium cladosporioides as the most common fungi present and Cadophora species less commonly isolated. DGGE revealed 28 taxa not detected by culturing including four taxa which possibly have not been previously described since they have less than 50% ITS sequence identity to any GenBank accessions. Fungi capable of causing degradation in the wood and artifacts associated with the expedition huts appear to be similar to those present in Antarctic soils, both near and at more remote locations. These species of fungi are likely indigenous to Antarctica and were apparently greatly influenced by the introduction of organic matter brought by early explorers. Considerable degradation has occurred in the wood and other materials by these fungi. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Soils with and without labelled Deschampsia antarctica (a native Antarctic grass) were incubated for 42 days and sampled at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days. Changes in microbial community structure were assessed using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and an analysis of the fatty acids associated with the neutral lipid fraction (NLFA). These studies showed that there were no significant changes in PLFA or NLFA profiles over time suggesting no change in microbial community structure during residue decomposition. There was a marked increase however, in ergosterol levels in these soils indicative of growth of the fungal biomass. Analysis of this ergosterol using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed the transformation of the plant residue by showing the incorporation of 13C-plant C into the ergosterol. This incorporation of 13C into the ergosterol increased over the incubation period. Importantly, these changes associated with fungal growth were not evident in the analysis of either the PLFA or NLFA fractions thus questioning the reliability of such approaches for studying changes in microbial communities associated with the decomposition of plant residues. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This study explores the effectiveness of 3% (w/v) Benomyl fungicide (Benlate) pre-treatments, on fungal "spoilage", viability and biochemical status of algae collected from terrestrial and freshwater habitats at Signy Island, maritime Antarctic. The results allow recommendations concerning sampling procedures and species selection for the ex-situ study of Antarctic algae to be made. The three algal taxa examined showed that although the fungicide was not necessary for successful transfer of viable specimens, it had a positive effect on viability. Prasiola crispa is suggested as a target organism for future ex-situ physiological studies.},

  abstract={We molecularly assesed the ascomycetous fungal communities inhabiting the rhizoid environment of Cephaloziella varians, collected at Rothera Point on the western Antarctic Peninsula. The RFLP-phenotyped and cloned PCR products of a partial small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene were sequenced and analyzed with neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP). Both analyses identified four bootstrap-supported groups: (i) a sister group to Onygenales, (ii) a well-supported clade with Phialocephala fortinii, (iii) a large group of clones nested within Chaetothyriales, and (iv) a group nested within Eurotiales with a likely affinity to the genus Aspergillus. An additional marginally supported clade, including helotialean Hymenoscyphus fructigenus, was detected in the NJ analysis. Placement of one clone (possibly helotialean) was not supported by either analysis. We included Hymenoscyphus ericae (Helotiales) in our analyses to test for its presence in clone libraries. None of our clones showed strongly supported affinity to H. ericae. The culture-independent technique proved useful for assessing the composition of rhizoid fungal communities, although it remains unknown whether any of these fungi colonize C. varians tissues. Direct-community assays of this kind might be best combined with traditional isolation techniques to get a more holistic view of fungi occupying plant tissues.},

  abstract={Ectomycorrhizal fungi have been shown to survive sub-zero temperatures in axenic culture and in the field. However, the physiological basis for resistance to freezing is poorly understood. In order to survive freezing, mycelia must synthesise compounds that protect the cells from frost damage, and certain fungal-specific soluble carbohydrates have been implicated in this role. Tissue concentrations of arabitol, mannitol and trehalose were measured in axenic cultures of eight Hebeloma strains of arctic and temperate origin grown at 22, 12, 6 and 2°C. In a separate experiment, mycelia were frozen to -5°C after pre-conditioning at either 2°C or 22°C. For some, especially temperate strains, there was a clear increase in specific soluble carbohydrates at lower growth temperatures. Trehalose and mannitol were present in all strains and the highest concentrations (close to 2.5% and 0.5% dry wt.) were recorded only after a cold period. Arabitol was found in four strains only when grown at low temperature. Cold pre-conditioning enhanced recovery of mycelia following freezing. In four out of eight strains, this was paralleled by increases in mannitol and trehalose concentration at low temperature that presumably contribute towards cryoprotection. The results are discussed in an ecological context with regard to mycelial overwintering in soil.},

A large proportion of yeasts isolated in this study were basidiomycetous species (89%), of which 43% may represent undescribed species, demonstrating that culturable yeasts remain incompletely described in these polar desert soils. Cryptococcus species represented the most often isolated genus (33%) followed by Leucosporidium (22%). Principle component analysis and multiple linear regression using stepwise selection was used to model the relation between abiotic variables (principle component 1 and principle component 2 scores) and yeast biodiversity (the number of species present at a given site). These analyses identified soil pH and electrical conductivity as significant predictors of yeast biodiversity.

This formation was deposited on a high-latitude (75°S) floodplain and consists of two facies associations, a lower braided alluvial plain unit and an upper coastal meander-belt unit. Analysis of fossil plants in well exposed palaeosols reveals the existence of spatially complex plant communities. Braidplains supported patchy, low-density (91 trees/ha) stands of podocarp and taxodioid conifers on floodbasin substrates, and conifer-cycadophyte-fern-angiosperm thickets in riparian settings. Coastal meander-belts supported medium density (568 trees/ha) podocarp-araucarian conifer forests on mature floodbasin soils, and fern-angiosperm-ginkgo thickets in riparian settings. Growth-ring analysis indicates plants experienced stressful growing conditions on the braidplain characterized by high-frequency flood events, but more favourable growing conditions on the coastal plain. Additional vegetation disturbances were caused by arthropod-fungal attack, frost and wildfire. In terms of structure, composition, ecology and productivity these predominantly evergreen, broad-leafed conifer forests bear similarities to the extant temperate rainforests of New Zealand.},

Choice test experiments on water agar medium, in which nematodes were enumerated in wells containing microbes at 24 and 48 h, indicated that there were differing preferences between nematodes for distinct prey. G. villosa was significantly attracted to the alga Chlorella cf. minutissima and the fungus Mortierella hyalina, and was more attracted to all algae and fungi than either of the other two nematodes. Both G. villosa and Teratocephalus spp. were attracted to an actinobacterium. Plectus spp. were significantly attracted to the alga Stichococcus bacillaris and bacteria with close taxonomic affinities to Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas and Polaromonas. Experiments using 0.5 μm diameter fluorescent beads indicated significantly increased ingestion by nematodes in the presence of each of these microbes compared with controls, except by Plectus spp. in the presence of S. bacillaris.

  abstract={For activity and survival in extreme terrestrial Antarctic habitats, lithobiontic cyanobacteria depend on key biomolecules for protection against environmental stress and for optimization of growth conditions. Their ability to synthesize such molecules is central to their pioneering characteristics and major role as primary producers in Antarctic desert habitats. Pigmentation is especially important in protecting them against enhanced UVB damage during stratospheric ozone depletion (the Ozone Hole) during the Antarctic spring and subsequent photoinhibition in the intense insolation of the summer. To be effective, especially for the screening of highly shade-adapted photosystems of cyanobacteria, protective pigments need to be located strategically. Antarctic lithic cyanobacterial communities are therefore stratified, as in soil biofilms of Alexander Island, the benthic stromatolitic mats of ice-covered hypersaline lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and the endolithic communities within translucent Beacon sandstone outcrops of Victoria Land. The protective pigments include scytonemin, carotenoids, anthroquinones and mycosporine-like amino acids. To detect and locate photoprotective pigments in situ in free-living cyanobacteria and cyanolichens from hot and cold desert habitats, we have used Fourier-transform Raman microspectroscopy. With appropriate power inputs for labile molecules, this high-precision, non-intrusive laser-based technique can not only identify biomolecules in their natural state but also locate them spatially within the habitat relative to the components of the community, which require protection. In conjunction with direct and epifluorescence microscopy it provides a spatial and functional description of the protective strategy of a community. We present the unique Raman spectrum of scytonemin and use its primary and corroborative peaks to identify it within the plethora of other biochemical constituents of several natural cyanobacterial communities, including an Antarctic endolith. The remote-sensing aspect of this technique makes it suitable not only for spatial biochemical analysis of present and palaeontological Antarctic communities but also for analogous putative habitats on Mars.},

These bacteria share characteristics with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Nodule inducing bacteria, like other PGPR, are capable of colonizing the roots of non-legumes and produce phytohormones, siderophores and HCN. They also exhibit antagonistic effects towards many plant pathogenic fungi. The potential of nodule inducing bacteria to function as PGPR, was examined by using radish as a model plant. Three percent of the 266 strains tested were found to be cyanogens, while a majority (83%) produced siderophores. Fifty eight percent of the strains produced indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and 54% solubilized phosphorus. Some of the bacterial species examined were found to have a deleterious effect while others were neutral or displayed a stimulatory effect on radishes. Bradyrizobium japonicum strain Soy 213 was found to have the highest stimulatory effect (60%), and an arctic strain (N44) was the most deleterious, causing a 44% reduction in radish dry matter yield. A second plant inoculation test, performed in growth cabinets, revealed that only strain Tal 629 of B. japonicum significantly increased (115%) the dry matter yield of radish. This indicates that specific bradyrhizobia have the potential to be used as PGPR on non-legumes.},

Indicators of vital and enzymatic activities, as well as the Biological Synthetic Indicator, show the existence of certain potentials of mineralization and biosynthesis, capable of soil-forming processes, but the almost year-round frost and the scarcity of weathered rock accumulated in the small depressions under the stone shelter do not permit the humification of organic material.},

  abstract={• A recent study identified a fungal isolate from the Antarctic leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians as the ericoid mycorrhizal associate Rhizoscyphus ericae. However, nothing is known about the wider Antarctic distribution of R. ericae in C. varians, and inoculation experiments confirming the ability of the fungus to form coils in the liverwort are lacking. • Using direct isolation and baiting with Vaccinium macrocarpon seedlings, fungi were isolated from C. varians sampled from eight sites across a 1875-km transect through sub- and maritime Antarctica. The ability of an isolate to form coils in aseptically grown C. varians was also tested. • Fungi with 98-99% sequence identity to R. ericae internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and partial large subunit ribosomal (r)DNA sequences were frequently isolated from C. varians at all sites sampled. The EF4/Fung5 primer set did not amplify small subunit rDNA from three of five R. ericae isolates, probably accounting for the reported absence of the fungus from C. varians in a previous study. Rhizoscyphus ericae was found to colonize aseptically-grown C. varians intracellularly, forming hyphal coils. • This study shows that the association between R. ericae and C. varians is apparently widespread in Antarctica, and confirms that R. ericae is at least in part responsible for the formation of the coils observed in rhizoids of field-collected C. varians. © The Authors (2007).},

  abstract={Fumarolic activity supports the growth of mat-like photoautotrophic communities near the summit (at 6,051 m) of Socompa Volcano in the arid core of the Andes mountains. These communities are isolated within a barren, high-elevation landscape where sparse vascular plants extend to only 4,600 m. Here, we combine biogeochemical and molecular-phylogenetic approaches to characterize the bacterial and eucaryotic assemblages associated with fumarolic and nonfumarolic grounds on Socompa. Small-subunit rRNA genes were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced from two fumarolic soil samples and two reference soil samples, including the volcanic debris that covers most of the mountain. The nonfumarolic, dry, volcanic soil was similar in nutrient status to the most extreme Antarctic Dry Valley or Atacama Desert soils, hosted relatively limited microbial communities dominated by Actinobacteria and Fungi, and contained no photoautotrophs. In contrast, modest fumarolic inputs were associated with elevated soil moisture and nutrient levels, the presence of chlorophyll a, and 13C-rich soil organic carbon. Moreover, this soil hosted diverse photoautotroph-dominated assemblages that contained novel lineages and exhibited structure and composition comparable to those of a wetland near the base of Socompa (3,661-m elevation). Fumarole-associated eucaryotes were particularly diverse, with an abundance of green algal lineages and a novel clade of microarthropods. Our data suggest that volcanic degassing of water and 13C-rich CO 2 sustains fumarole-associated primary producers, leading to a complex microbial ecosystem within this otherwise barren landscape. Finally, we found that human activities have likely impacted the fumarolic soils and that fumarole-supported photoautotrophic communities may be exceptionally sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance.},

  abstract={Two species of lichens, six cyanobacteria, one diatom, 10 chlorophytes and two mycelial fungi were found at La Gorce Mountains (86°30'S, 147°W) at an altitude of about 1750 m. The lichens Lecidea cancriformis and Carbonea vorticosa occurred at a single site which is the most southerly record of lichens. Thousands of small ponds covered extensive ice-cored moraine. Nine ponds sampled had about 30 cm of ice overlying about 26 cm of water and contained algal mats dominated by Phormidium autumnale and cf. Leptolyngbyafragilis. The very low conductivity waters had high nitrate and low dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations. Of 124 soil samples, five contained visible algae. In 32 there were only microscopic growths but no algae were detected in 87 samples, possibly because of lack of water for much of summer. A visible mat dominated by Hammatoidea normanni occurred in a rock fissure at the lichen site. At Price Bluff, green patches of Desmococcus cf. olivaceus, up to 20 cm2, were scattered over the moraine. Growths were revealed at the soil-ice interface when overlying soil up to one centimetre thick was removed. It is suggested that although dispersal of algae from local populations may be readily achieved establishment of populations is a rare event outside the pond environment.},

  abstract={Samples of horizons in paleosols from the Quartermain Mountains of the Antarctic Dry Valleys (Aztec and New Mountain areas) were analyzed for their physical characteristics, mineralogy, chemical composition, and microbiology to determine the accumulation and movement of salts and other soluble constituents and the presence/absence of microbial populations. Salt concentrations are of special interest because they are considered to be a function of age, derived over time, in part from nearby oceanic and high-altitude atmospheric sources. The chemical composition of ancient Mioceneage paleosols in these areas is the direct result of the deposition and weathering of airborne-influxed salts and other materials, as well as the weathering of till derived principally from local dolerite and sandstone outcrops. Paleosols nearer the coast have greater contents of C1, whereas near the inland ice sheet, nitrogen tends to increase on a relative basis. The accumulation and vertical distribution of salts and other soluble chemical elements indicate relative amounts of movement in the profile over long periods of time, in the order of several million years. Four of the six selected subsamples from paleosol horizons in two ancient soil profiles contained nil concentrations of bacteria and fungi. However, two horizons at depths of between 3 and 8 cm, in two profiles, yielded several colonies of the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Penicillium brevicompactum, indicating very minor input of organic carbon. Beauveria bassiana is often reported in association with insects and is used commercially for the biological control of some insect pests. Penicillium species are commonly isolated from Arctic, temperate, and tropical soils and are known to utilize a wide variety of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds. The cold, dry soils of the Antarctic bear a close resemblance to various present and past martian environments where similar weathering could occur and possible microbial populations may exist. © 2001 Elsevier Science.},

  abstract={Little is known about the effects of hydrocarbons and fuel oil on Antarctic filamentous fungi in the terrestrial Antarctic environment. Growth of fungi and bacteria from soils around Rothera Research Station (Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula) was assessed in the presence of ten separate aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons [marine gas oil (MGO), dodecane, hexadecane, benzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, toluene, phenol, biphenyl, naphthalene and m- and p-xylenes with ethylbenzene]. Aromatic hydrocarbons inhibited soil microbial growth more than aliphatic hydrocarbons. Soil microorganisms from a moss patch, where little previous impact or hydrocarbon contamination had occurred, were less tolerant of hydrocarbons than those from high impact sites. Fungal growth rates of Mollisia sp., Penicillium commune, Mortierella sp., Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma sp. and Phoma herbarum were assessed in the presence of hydrocarbons. Generally, aromatic hydrocarbons inhibited or stopped hyphal extension, though growth rates increased with some aliphatic hydrocarbons. Hyphal dry weight measurements suggested that Mortierella sp. may be able to use dodecane as sole carbon and energy source. Hydrocarbon-degrading Antarctic fungi may have use in future hydrocarbon spill bioremediation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Numbers of both particle types were most common in the air in summer. The Antarctic soil fungus Geomyces pannorum, which is able to utilize keratin-based substrates, was also present in aerobiological samples on Signy Island. G. pannorum was only found during early winter on the year-round sampling sites. It was more abundant during summer in the air at the coastal site, which was more heavily influenced by seals, birds and humans. Skuas were swabbed when they returned to the island early in summer. G. pannorum was recovered in culture, suggesting that these birds may act as vectors for the transport of microorganisms between Antarctica and more northern landmasses. Organic material deposited on snow was concentrated on the soil at the edge of the ice cap by melt wash, making additional keratin and other organic substrates available to soil microorganisms.},

  abstract={A seasonal survey was undertaken, over a year, of phytoplankton from surface water in the western English Channel (Station L4) measuring mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), photosynthetic pigments and microscopic counts. Ground level solar radiation (ultraviolet-B, ultraviolet-A and photosynthetically active radiation; UV-B, UV-A and PAR) was measured at a nearby site. From this we estimated in situ solar irradiance received by phytoplankton using measurements of the mixed layer depth and calculations of the 50% light level cut-off. The MAAs occurred year round, with concentrations increasing rapidly during spring and summer (maximum 8.5 μgl-1) to levels exceeding those of chlorophyll-a (chl-a maximum 3.6 μgl-1). On two occasions, increases in specific MAAs coincide with algal blooms. In spring, increases in mycosporine-glycine (λmax310 nm in the UV-B) coincide with a bloom of the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis pouchetii and in July and August increases in an unidentified MAA (λmax 328 nm) match a bloom of the diatom, Guinardia striata (=Rhizosolenia stolterfothii). Concentration of MAAs, but not chlorophyll, correlate with in situ irradiance. The ratio of MAA to chl-a increases linearily with in situ irradiance received by phytoplankton reaching 13.9 nmol MAA (nmol chl-a)-1 at 101 W m-2. Evidence of photoinduction is observed during the P pouchetii bloom with a four fold increase in the concentration of mycosporine-glycine (maximum 2 pg cell-1) as UV-B:PAR ratio increases from 0.0011 to 0.0014. Dinoflagellates, although contributing to < 10% of biomass, are found through the correlation of MAAs to the biomarker peridinin, to contribute to baseline levels of MAAs throughout the year. Our MAA:chl-a values for the English Channel are similar to those measured in coastal areas of southern USA. Similarities with studies on Antarctic phytoplankton are also found with the dominance of porphra-334 and the presence of mycosporine-glycine in P. pouchetti.},

  abstract={In a high Arctic polar semidesert ecosystem (ambient N deposition c. 0.1 g N m-2 a-1), the effects of N enrichment on the diversity of soil microfungi and on N content and availability in organic and mineral soils were determined. Three N (total: 0, 0.5, 5gN m-2 a-1) and two P (total 0, 1 g m-2 a-1) treatments were applied, since P may limit response to N in this ecosystem. Organic and mineral soils were sampled in June and August in the second year of treatment for microfungi, pH, moisture content, and total N and P. In the third year, soils were resampled for extractable and total N and P. The fungi isolated were typical of high pH soils in the High Arctic and Antarctic. The species richness and diversity of soil microfungi were very low, with ranges as follows: Shannon diversity, 0.56-1.5; richness, 2-6; evenness, 0.79-0.9. There was no significant effect of treatment on the frequency of occurrence of different taxa of soil microfungi. Time of sampling also had no significant impact on fungal assemblages, although different, more diverse communities were isolated from organic, rather than mineral, soils. Nitrate-N in organic soil decreased significantly when P was added alone, but not when P and N were added together. Addition of 0.5 g N m-2 a-1, a rate deposition already occurring in Greenland and Iceland, appeared to exceed N demand even when P limitation was relieved. There was no apparent soil acidification as a result of the N treatments. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract={In Northern Fennoscandia, sub-arctic and arctic grasslands are commonly grazed by the semi-domesticated reindeer. Reindeer grazing is known to affect plant production and belowground processes, such as nutrient mineralization in these grasslands, but little is known of the role of plant community structure in the response of plant and soil properties to the defoliation of plants. Using soil and seeds from a low arctic meadow, we established a 23-week greenhouse experiment to test whether communities of different plant species richness (one, two or four species) and composition (three different replicated compositions within each richness level) respond to defoliation in a different way. We defoliated plants twice to 2 cm above the soil surface in half of the replicates of each community and analyzed the response of different communities in terms of changes in plant mass accumulation and the abundance of soil organisms (microbes, protozoa and nematodes). We predicted that these parameters and their resistance to defoliation will: (1) differ among plant species compositions; and (2) increase with increasing plant species richness. We found that plant species composition affected shoot mass accumulation (comprising both defoliated and harvested shoot mass), harvested root mass (in non-defoliated systems) and the abundance of decomposer fungi in the soil. Defoliation increased the numbers of fungal-feeding and predatory nematodes regardless of plant community structure, while the effects on roots and decomposer fungi varied across plant species compositions. Of the measured variables, only the abundance of omnivorous Aporcelaimellus spp. nematodes responded to plant species richness and no evidence was found that the effects of defoliation on any variable were modified by species richness. Soil bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, protozoa and bacterial- and root-feeding nematodes did not respond to any treatment. Our results suggest that defoliation effects may to some extent differ between different plant species compositions in the low arctic grasslands grazed by the reindeer. However, it appears that they may not depend on plant species richness. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={In previous work, several bacterial groups that show a response to fruiting bodies (the mycosphere) of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria proxima were identified. We here extend this work to a broader range of fungal fruiting bodies sampled at two occasions. PCR-DGGE analyses showed clear effects of the mycosphere of diverse fungi on the total bacterial and Pseudomonas communities in comparison with those in the corresponding bulk soil. The diversities of the Pseudomonas communities increased dramatically in most of the mycospheres tested, which contrasted with a decrease of the diversity of the total bacterial communities in these habitats. The data also indicated the existence of universal (i.e. Pseudomonas poae, P. lini, P. umsongensis, P. corrugata, P. antarctica and Rahnella aquatilis) as well as specific (i.e. P. viridiflava and candidatus Xiphinematobacter americani) fungiphiles, defined as bacteria adapted to the mycospheres of, respectively, three or more or just one fungal species. The selection of such fungiphiles was shown to be strongly related to their capacities to use particular carbonaceous compounds, as evidenced using principal components analyses of BIOLOG-based substrate utilization tests. The differentiating compounds, i.e. l-arabinose, l-leucine, m-inositol, m-arabitol, d-mannitol and d-trehalose, were tentatively linked to compounds known to occur in mycosphere exudates. © 2008 The Authors.},

  abstract={We provide a phylogenetic diversity assessment study in genus Agaricus as part of our ongoing work to saturate ITS and LSU rDNA sequence diversity of soil-dwelling fungi in Alaska. Pairwise sequence similarity-based groupings and statistical parsimony analyses were applied to delimit operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and were compared to results of full phylogenetic analyses. Our results show that the proportion of section Arvenses taxa is particularly high in the boreal forest and hypo-arctic (low arctic) regions, whereas the genus is represented by section Agaricus in high arctic habitats. Furthermore our findings suggest that the commercially important A. bisporus occurs naturally in the boreal region of interior Alaska, substantially expanding the known northern limit of the species. Delimitations of OTU varied greatly with different methods. In general 95% similarity-based grouping proved to be the least sensitive method, often resulting in section- and subsection-level groups. The 95% connection-limit statistical parsimony separated far more groups. The 98% similarity-based groups and the 98% connection limit networks recognized respectively 11 and 13 OTU containing our specimens. The 98% connection limit statistical parsimony was the only method in which all recognized OTU consisted of members grouped by branches with significant (> .95) posterior probabilities, providing an independent support for the groups. Our results also point out that considerable additional efforts will be needed to elucidate the evolution of this diverse genus and to assess its phylogenetic diversity, given that most taxa in our analyses could not be placed convincingly within well characterized species using ITS/LSU data. © 2008 by The Mycological Society of America.},

  abstract={Understanding the relationship between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is critical to predicting and monitoring the effects of ecosystem changes on important soil processes. However, most of Earth's soils are too biologically diverse to identify each species present and determine their functional role in food webs. The soil ecosystems of Victoria Land (VL) Antarctica are functionally and biotically simple, and serve as in situ models for determining the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem processes. For a few VL taxa (microarthropods, nematodes, algae, mosses and lichens), species diversity has been intensively assessed in highly localized habitats, but little is known of how community assemblages vary across broader spatial scales, or across latitudinal and environmental gradients. The composition of tardigrade, rotifer, protist, fungal and prokaryote communities is emerging. The latter groups are the least studied, but potentially the most diverse. Endemism is highest for microarthropods and nematodes, less so for tardigrades and rotifers, and apparently low for mosses, lichens, protists, fungi and prokaryotes. Much of what is known about VL diversity and distribution occurs in an evolutionary and ecological vacuum; links between taxa and functional role in ecosystems are poorly known and future studies must utilize phylogenetic information to infer patterns of community assembly, speciation, extinction, population processes and biogeography. However, a comprehensive compilation of all the species that participate in soil ecosystem processes, and their distribution across regional and landscape scales is immediately achievable in VL with the resources, tools, and expertise currently available. We suggest that the soil ecosystems of VL should play a major role in exploring the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and in monitoring the effects of environmental change on soil processes in real time and space. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, we investigated the responses of microbial communities to manipulations of solar UV-B radiation. Results reported here are for field plots receiving either near-ambient or reduced solar UV-B using plastic filters in a Sphagnum peatland and a Carex fen during the second and third years of UV-B manipulations. The total number of testate amoebae (Protozoa, Rhizopoda) inhabiting the upper centimeter of Sphagnum magellanicum was greater under near-ambient solar UV-B than under reduced UV-B. No response to UV-B manipulation was apparent for rotifers, nematodes, bacteria, microfungi, and a common microalga (Euglena mutabilis) inhabiting the S. magellanicum. On leaves of small Nothofagus antarctica trees, the ratio of upper: lower leaf-surface fungal populations for the genus Aureobasidium and for total fungi indicated lower populations on the upper, relative to the lower, surface under near-ambient solar UV-B. When responses to modifications of the solar UV-B flux were detected, these involved both direct UV-B inhibition and indirect consequences of UV-B manipulation. © New Phytologist (2001).},

Fungal communities were assessed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms.

The change in genotype density in the warmed plots was associated with an increase in PCR amplification efficiency, suggesting that increased C allocation belowground is increasing the overall biomass of the fungal community. © 2008 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Climate change may influence the relationship between arctic plants and their symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. The benefit of the symbiosis for the host plant affects vegetation succession and may be a key parameter in predicting vegetation responses to warming. We investigated the mycorrhizal benefit in the low arctic perennial herbs Potentilla crantzii and Ranunculus acris in symbiosis with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus claroideum. Temperature response in the mycorrhiza-mediated acquisition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), growth, and photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency were determined. Near the average natural soil temperature (12°C), mycorrhiza did not improve plant nutrient capture but significantly enhanced plant P capture at 17°C. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency was higher at 17°C than at 12°C and was further increased by mycorrhiza at 178C. Photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency was not affected by temperature or mycorrhiza. Increasing the growing temperature by 5°C increased the relative shoot growth rate by 15%. Mycorrhizal symbiosis did not enhance plant growth rate, but the plants gained between 20% and 90% more mycorrhiza-mediated P when grown at higher temperature.

The data were used to (i) test the hypothesis that diversity would decrease with increasing southerly latitude and environmental severity, as is generally claimed for "higher" faunal and plant groups, and (ii) investigate the level of endemicity displayed in different taxonomic groups. Only limited support was obtained for a systematic decrease in diversity with latitude, and then only at the level of a gross comparison between maritime (Antarctic Peninsula/Scotia Arc) and continental Antarctic sites. While the most southerly continental Antarctic site was three to four times less diverse than all maritime sites, there was no evidence for a trend of decreasing diversity across the entire range of the maritime Antarctic (60 to 72°S). Rather, we found the reverse pattern, with highest diversity at sites on Alexander Island (ca. 72°S), at the southern limit of the maritime Antarctic. The very limited overlap found between the eukaryotic biota of the different study sites, combined with their generally low relatedness to existing sequence databases, indicates a high level of Antarctic site isolation and possibly endemicity, a pattern not consistent with similar studies on other continents.},

  abstract={Microfungi were isolated from soils, mosses, algae and lichens in the Windmill Islands region of Antarctica. From a total of 1,228 isolates, 22 genera were identified. The most frequently isolated fungi from mosses were Mycelia sterilia (47% of total isolates), Phoma spp. (18%), Penicillium spp. (11%), Chrysosporium spp. (7%) and Thelebolus microsporus (6%). Mycelia sterilia, Penicillium spp., Mortierella spp., Chrysosporium cf. pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were also frequently isolated from algae. Fungal distribution and diversity were poor in samples of lichens, compared to samples from mosses and algae. The frequency of occurrence of microfungi was most often associated with strong biotic influence. There was a marked increase in fungal diversity in human-disturbed sites. Twelve taxa were restricted to soils from near the Australian Casey Station, suggesting significant introduction of fungi into this environment by human activities. Away from the station, fungal distribution appeared to be related to substrata and nutrient status rather than dispersal opportunities. Suggestions for future research and the need for constant monitoring to clarify the role of human disturbance on Antarctic fungi are discussed.},

  abstract={We investigated belowground responses of Nothofagus alpina seedlings to post-fire conditions during natural regeneration after a wildfire in Chile, focusing on mycorrhizal community and root architecture. The complete root systems of 2-year-old N. alpina seedlings were extracted from a post-fire site with natural regeneration and compared to roots of seedlings from undisturbed forest nearby. Mycorrhizal morphotype richness was determined in each seedling. Morphometric parameters of tertiary root structure and dry biomass of whole root systems were determined in 5 cm vertical intervals and in four lateral root classes. With 43.5% of colonized vital mycorrhizal root tips, the Basidiomycete Descolea antarctica was the most abundant fungal symbiont on post-fire seedlings. Tertiary root morphology of these seedlings was distinct from control plants and characterized by a deep-reaching tap root with rather evenly distributed lateral branches whereas seedlings from the undisturbed site had shallower root systems with most lateral roots concentrated in the upper soil layers. Post-fire seedlings had more mycorrhizal rootlets and mycorrhiza-bearing third order lateral roots than control plants which was expressed in a 34% higher total root number but only a 10% higher total root biomass, although both values were not statistically significant. A major part of these fine roots in seedlings from burnt forest was found in deeper soil horizons, compared to the seedlings from undisturbed forest. According to our results, post-fire conditions clearly favour Descolea antarctica as an early ectomycorrhizal colonizer of Nothofagus seedlings at the studied site. As no significant changes in soil chemistry could be observed at the burnt site, the deep-reaching tertiary root architecture of these seedlings may be interpreted as a response to other abiotic factors like reduced moisture in surface soil. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract={Oil spillage on the moist coastal soils of the Ross Sea region of Antarctica can impact on populations of microbial heterotrophs in these soils, as determined by viable plate counts and a most probable number technique. Elevated numbers of culturable hydrocarbon degraders, bacteria and fungi were detected in surface and subsurface soils from oil-contaminated sites, compared with nearby control sites. Culturable yeasts were not detected in soil from coastal control sites, yet reached > 105 organisms g-1 dry weight in contaminated soils. The presence of hydrocarbons in soils resulted in a shift in the genera of culturable filamentous fungi. Chrysosporium dominated control soils, yet Phialophora was more abundant in oil-contaminated soils. Hydrocarbon degraders are most likely bacteria; however, fungi could play a role in degradation of hydrocarbons or their metabolites. Depleted levels of nitrate detected in some contaminated soils and decreased pH may be the result of growth of hydrocarbon degraders. Numbers and diversity of culturable microbes from Antarctic soil varied depending on whether a pristine site or a human-impacted (in this case, by fuel spills) site is studied.},

  abstract={Fungi associated with photosynthetic organisms are major determinants of terrestrial biomass, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem productivity from the poles to the equator. Whereas most fungi are known because of their fruit bodies (e.g., saprotrophs), symptoms (e.g., pathogens), or emergent properties as symbionts (e.g., lichens), the majority of fungal diversity is thought to occur among species that rarely manifest their presence with visual cues on their substrate (e.g., the apparently hyperdiverse fungal endophytes associated with foliage of plants). Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous among all lineages of land plants and live within overtly healthy tissues without causing disease, but the evolutionary origins of these highly diverse symbionts have not been explored. Here, we show that a key to understanding both the evolution of endophytism and the diversification of the most species-rich phylum of Fungi (Ascomycota) lies in endophyte-like fungi that can be isolated from the interior of apparently healthy lichens. These "endolichenic" fungi are distinct from lichen mycobionts or any other previously recognized fungal associates of lichens, represent the same major lineages of Ascomycota as do endophytes, largely parallel the high diversity of endophytes from the arctic to the tropics, and preferentially associate with green algal photobionts in lichen thalli. Using phylogenetic analyses that incorporate these newly recovered fungi and ancestral state reconstructions that take into account phylogenetic uncertainty, we show that endolichenism is an incubator for the evolution of endophytism. In turn, endophytism is evolutionarily transient, with endophytic lineages frequently transitioning to and from pathogenicity. Although symbiotrophic lineages frequently give rise to free-living saprotrophs, reversions to symbiosis are rare. Together, these results provide the basis for estimating trophic transition networks in the Ascomycota and provide a first set of hypotheses regarding the evolution of symbiotrophy and saprotrophy in the most species-rich fungal phylum.

  abstract={When soil nitrogen is in short supply, most terrestrial plants form symbioses with fungi (mycorrhizae): hyphae take up soil nitrogen, transport it into plant roots, and receive plant sugars in return. In ecosystems, the transfers within the pathway fractionate nitrogen isotopes so that the natural abundance of 15N in fungi differs from that in their host plants by as much as 12‰. Here we present a new method to quantify carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the symbiosis based on the fractionation against 15N during transfer of nitrogen from fungi to plant roots. We tested this method, which is based on the mass balance of 15N, with data from arctic Alaska where the nitrogen cycle is well studied. Mycorrhizal fungi provided 61-86% of the nitrogen in plants; plants provided 8-17% of their photosynthetic carbon to the fungi for growth and respiration. This method of analysis avoids the disturbance of the soil-microbe-root relationship caused by collecting samples, mixing the soil, or changing substrate concentrations. This analytical technique also can be applied to other nitrogen-limited ecosystems, such as many temperate and boreal forests, to quantify the importance for terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycling of nutrient transfers mediated by mycorrhizae at the plant-soil interface. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract={Melanised fungi were isolated from rock surfaces in the Central Mountain System of Spain. Two hundred sixty six isolates were recovered from four geologically and topographically distinct sites. Microsatellite-primed PCR techniques were used to group isolates into genotypes assumed to represent species. One hundred and sixty three genotypes were characterised from the four sites. Only five genotypes were common to two or more sites. Morphological and molecular data were used to characterise and identify representative strains, but morphology rarely provided a definitive identification due to the scarce differentiation of the fungal structures or the apparent novelty of the isolates. Vegetative states of fungi prevailed in culture and in many cases could not be reliably distinguished without sequence data. Morphological characters that were widespread among the isolates included scarce micronematous conidial states, endoconidia, mycelia with dark olive-green or black hyphae, and mycelia with torulose, isodiametric or moniliform hyphae whose cells develop one or more transverse and/or oblique septa. In many of the strains, mature hyphae disarticulated, suggesting asexual reproduction by a thallic micronematous conidiogenesis or by simple fragmentation. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2) and 5.8S rDNA gene were employed to investigate the phylogenetic affinities of the isolates. According to ITS sequence alignments, the majority of the isolates could be grouped among four main orders of Pezizomycotina: Pleosporales, Dothideales, Capnodiales, and Chaetothyriales. Ubiquitous known soil and epiphytic fungi species were generally absent from the rock surfaces. In part, the mycota of the rock surfaces shared similar elements with melanised fungi from plant surfaces and fungi described from rock formations in Europe and Antarctica. The possibility that some of the fungi were lichen mycobionts or lichen parasites could not be ruled out. © 2008 Nationaal Herbarium Nederland Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures.},

Two sites at Edmonson Point were studied: the first was poor in nutrients, near the glacier, and the second was close to bird nesting sites. The highest abundance of soil fungi was recorded at the site adjacent to the bird nesting sites. Phoma herbarum was the most abundant taxon. Lecytophora lignicola and Ascotricha erinacea are new records for continental Antarctica. The fungal assemblage from the nutrient-deficient site was characterized by a dominance-diversity curve approaching the broken-stick model, the assemblage from the soil influenced by birds was characterized by a lognormal distribution. Plastic cloches were used in experiments designed to assess differences in fungal assemblages subjected to altered temperature and/or UV exposure. Dominance-diversity curves and diversity values of soil fungal mycobiota were compared in their natural condition as compared with manipulated conditions. Under the walled cloches, at both sites, artificial warming led to stress on Antarctic soil fungal assemblages. In contrast, UV protection led to a higher equilibrium in the assemblage structure. On the basis of the results obtained, it could be proposed that UV radiation is the most important limiting ecological factor for soil mycobiota in continental Antarctica. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Here, U. antarctica grows on rocks and forms the dominant vegetation on this site together with a few other macrolichens. This species reproduces mainly by vegetative diaspores (soredia), which include both the photobiont and the mycobiont. To understand the early ontogenetic strategies in U. antarctica, culture experiments were performed in an Antarctic field site where the species occurs naturally. This paper focuses on the different developmental steps seen between the initial colonization of soredia to the formation of a small well-developed thallus, and also on the growth rate of the respective juvenile stages. Compared with growth rates of lichens from temperate European regions the early development of U. antarctica is extraordinarily slow, taking 5-6 years until an adult thallus has been formed. The low photobiont content in the juvenile stages probably limits the growth rate. It is suggested that juvenile development of U. antarctica is controlled by a combination of ecophysiological and morphological adaptations that are required for success in extreme environments such as the terrestrial habitats of the Antarctic.},

  abstract={The terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica is restricted to small, very isolated, ice-free areas on the continent and on the islands adjacent to the Peninsula region. Lichens, a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, form the most prominent component in the vegetation. They have the greatest number of species compared with other cryptogamic and unicellular organisms. They are able to colonize all types of solid substrata and have a low mineral nutrient demand. Their physiological vigour is derived from high freezing tolerance and the ability to be photosynthetically activated by water vapour uptake from snow at temperatures as low as c. -20°C. Long-term monitoring in their natural habitats demonstrates that lichens are photosynthetically active at suboptimal temperatures. Locally, however, they can benefit from meltwater on insolated rocks, but only for short periods in early summer. Although at this time they may be exposed to substrate temperatures of > 20°C and strong light they do not suffer from photostress. If, in winter, lichens are covered and kept dark by snow with temperatures close to 0°C, lichens enter a negative carbon balance. This effect may be relevant to lichens under conditions of global or regional warming.},

  abstract={Mammal grazing is composed of three mechanisms-removal of foliar tissue (defoliation), return of nutrients via dung and urine (fertilization), and trampling. To evaluate the relative role of these mechanisms in the effect of reindeer grazing on soil biota in northern grasslands, we subjected experimental plots in a sub-arctic alpine meadow to defoliation, fertilization (using NPK-solution), simulated trampling, and their factorial combinations once a year from 2002 to 2004 and measured the response of plants and decomposers (including microbes, nematodes, collembolans, and enchytraeids) in 2004. Trampling affected both plant and decomposer communities: the coverage of the moss Pleurozium schreberi and the sedge Carex vaginata, as well as the abundance of collembolans and enchytraeids were reduced in trampled plots. Trampling and fertilization also interacted significantly, with fertilization increasing the abundance of bacteria and bacterial-feeding and omnivorous nematodes in trampled plots only, and trampling decreasing fungal biomass in non-fertilized plots only. Defoliation had no overall effects on plants or decomposers. Nematode genera were not affected by the experimental treatments, but nematode and plant communities were significantly associated, and all decomposer biota, except collembolans, were strongly affected by the spatial heterogeneity of the study site. Our results indicate that trampling may have larger and defoliation and fertilization smaller roles than anticipated in explaining reindeer grazing effects in sub-arctic grasslands. However, even the effects of trampling seem to be outweighed by the spatial heterogeneity of decomposer abundances. This suggests that in sub-arctic grasslands spatial variation in abiotic factors can be a more important factor than grazing in controlling soil biota abundances. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract={Evidence gathered from spacecraft orbiting Mars has shown that water ice exists at both poles and may form a large subsurface reservoir at lower latitudes. The recent exploration of the martian surface by unmanned landers and surface rovers, and the planned missions to eventually return samples to Earth have raised concerns regarding both forward and back contamination. Methods to search for life in these icy environments and adequate protocols to prevent contamination can be tested with earthly analogues. Studies of ice cores on Earth have established past climate changes and geological events, both globally and regionally, but only recently have these results been correlated with the biological materials (i.e., plant fragments, seeds, pollen grains, fungal spores, and microorganisms) that are entrapped and preserved within the ice. The inclusion of biology into ice coring research brings with it a whole new approach towards decontamination. Our investigations on ice from the Vostok core (Antarctica) have shown that the outer portion of the cores have up to 3 and 2 orders of magnitude higher bacterial density and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than the inner portion of the cores, respectively, as a result of drilling and handling. The extreme gradients that exist between the outer and inner portion of these samples make contamination a very relevant aspect of geomicrobiological investigations with ice cores, particularly when the actual numbers of ambient bacterial cells are low. To address this issue and the inherent concern it raises for the integrity of future investigations with ice core materials from terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments, we employed a procedure to monitor the decontamination process in which ice core surfaces are painted with a solution containing a tracer microorganism, plasmid DNA, and fluorescent dye before sampling. Using this approach, a simple and direct method is proposed to verify the authenticity of geomicrobiological results obtained from ice core materials. Our protocol has important implications for the design of life detection experiments on Mars and the decontamination of samples that will eventually be returned to Earth. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract={Cryptoendolithic microbial communities, living in porous sandstone rocks in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Ross Desert) of Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, were found within weathered pegmatite rocks in Northern Victoria Land, and the first endemic Antarctic fungal genus Friedmanniomyces endolithicus anam.-gen. and sp. nov. was isolated from this community. Selected microfungi from these communities and from soil were examined for the production of extracellular enzymes and antibiotic substances. The cryptoendolithic strain CCFEE 5001 was particularly remarkable for consistent glycosidase activity, coupled with barely detectable growth. Chitinase activity was highest in the soil mi-crofungus Verticillium cfr. lecanii (CCFEE 5003). This strain and its purified chitinase were active on Mucor plumbeus, Cladospori-um cladosporioides, Aspergillus versicolor, and Penicillium verrucosum, producing mycelial damage and cell lysis. The strain CCFEE 5020, isolated from rocks, showed antibiotic activity against Pseudomonas putida, Sarcina sp., Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli, under the test conditions. Good antibiotic activity was produced in the temperature range of 5° to 25° C, pH 4.0, agitation at 700 rpm, and areation at 1.0 vvm, in media containing 0.5% substrate sugar, though this supported only minimal growth. The investigation of soil microfungi in contrasting sites at the BIOTAS area at Edmonson Point indicated that both the presence of bird colonies and changes in temperature and UV exposure obtained by using plastic cloches influenced species composition and density.

  abstract={Root and soil samples from 13 collecting sites located in the Canadian High Arctic were harvested between July 18 and 29, 1991, and surveyed for root colonization and spore populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Grasses of the genus Festuca (Festuca brachyphylla Schult. and Schult., Festuca baffinensis Polunin, and Festuca hyperborea Holmen ex Frederiksen) served as target plants. Of the 197 plant-root systems and soil rhizospheres examined, 28% were associated with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Roots of both F. brachyphylla and F. baffinensis were colonized, while none were detected in F. hyperborea root specimens. Five arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species were extracted from indigenous soils. The most frequent and abundant species was Glomus mosseae (Nicol. and Gerd.) Gerdemann and Trappe, which was isolated from 8 of the 13 sites sampled. Other Glomales species in Arctic soils were Glomus macrocarpum Tul and Tul., Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxter sensu Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe emend. Walker and Koske, and two other unidentified Glomus species. Trap cultures of the indigenous soil with leek (Allium porrum L.) plants confirmed the identity of the species previously identified from original soil and allowed the detection of an additional species, Glomus aggregatum Schenck. and Smith. The novelty of these observations and the relationship between plant mycorrhizal status., fungal species, and soil disturbance are discussed.},

  abstract={The temporal and spatial snow cover dynamics is the primary factor controlling the plant communities' composition and biogeochemical cycles in arctic and alpine tundra. However, the relationships between the distribution of snow and the diversity of soil microbial communities remain largely unexplored. Over a period of 2 years, we monitored soil microbial communities at three sites, including contiguous alpine meadows of late and early snowmelt locations (LSM and ESM, respectively). Bacterial and fungal communities were characterized by using molecular fingerprinting and cloning/sequencing of microbial ribosomal DNA extracted from the soil. Herein, we show that the spatial and temporal distribution of snow strongly correlates with microbial community composition. High seasonal contrast in ESM is associated with marked seasonal shifts for bacterial communities; whereas less contrasted seasons because of long-lasting snowpack in LSM is associated with increased fungal diversity. Finally, our results indicate that, similar to plant communities, microbial communities exhibit important shifts in composition at two extremes of the snow cover gradient. However, winter conditions lead to the convergence of microbial communities independently of snow cover presence. This study provides new insights into the distribution of microbial communities in alpine tundra in relation to snow cover dynamics, and may be helpful in predicting the future of microbial communities and biogeochemical cycles in arctic and alpine tundra in the context of a warmer climate. © 2009 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

Here, we describe the phylogenetic placement, growth rates, and metabolic potential of cold-adapted fungi from under-snow mats in the subalpine forests of Colorado. SSU rDNA sequencing revealed that these fungi belong to the zygomycete orders Mucorales and Mortierellales. All of the isolates could grow at temperatures observed under the snow at our sites (0°C and -2°C) but were unable to grow at temperatures above 25°C and were unable to grow anaerobically. Growth rates for these fungi were very high at -2°C, approximately an order of magnitude faster than previously studied cold-tolerant fungi from Antarctic soils. Given the rapid aerobic growth of these fungi at low temperatures, we propose that they are uniquely adapted to take advantage of the flush of nutrient that occurs at the soil-snow interface beneath late winter snow packs. In addition, extracellular enzyme production was relatively high for the Mucorales, but quite low for the Mortierellales, perhaps indicating some niche separation between these fungi beneath the late winter snow pack. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract={For activity and survival in extreme terrestrial Antarctic habitats, lithobiontic cyanobacteria depend on key biomolecules for protection against environmental stress and for optimization of growth conditions. Their ability to synthesize such molecules is central to their pioneering characteristics and major role as primary producers in Antarctic desert habitats. Pigmentation is especially important in protecting them against enhanced UVB damage during stratospheric ozone depletion (the Ozone Hole) during the Antarctic spring and subsequent photoinhibition in the intense insolation of the summer. To be effective, especially for the screening of highly shade-adapted photosystems of cyanobacteria, protective pigments need to be located strategically. Antarctic lithic cyanobacterial communities are therefore stratified, as in soil biofilms of Alexander Island, the benthic stromatolitic mats of ice-covered hypersaline lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and the endolithic communities within translucent Beacon sandstone outcrops of Victoria Land. The protective pigments include scytonemin, carotenoids, anthroquinones and mycosporine-like amino acids. To detect and locate photoprotective pigments in situ in free-living cyanobacteria and cyanolichens from hot and cold desert habitats, we have used Fourier-transform Raman microspectroscopy. With appropriate power inputs for labile molecules, this high-precision, non-intrusive laser-based technique can not only identify biomolecules in their natural state but also locate them spatially within the habitat relative to the components of the community, which require protection. In conjunction with direct and epifluorescence microscopy it provides a spatial and functional description of the protective strategy of a community. We present the unique Raman spectrum of scytonemin and use its primary and corroborative peaks to identify it within the plethora of other biochemical constituents of several natural cyanobacterial communities, including an Antarctic endolith. The remote-sensing aspect of this technique makes it suitable not only for spatial biochemical analysis of present and palaeontological Antarctic communities but also for analogous putative habitats on Mars. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Two ectomycorrhizal strains of the fungus Descolea antarctica (D1 and D2) were cultured at different temperatures, pH levels and the activities of amylases, cellulases, and phosphatases were determined. In greenhouse and nursery trials, the growth responses of inoculated Nothofagus obliqua seedlings were evaluated. D1 and D2 exhibited the highest growth rates at 23°C. Both strains grew at pH levels from 4 to 11. The highest enzymatic activities were registered for amylase (57.2 mg glucose/ml * g of mycelium * hr) and acid phosphatases (58.1 mg p-nitrophenol/ml * g of mycelium * hr) at 37°C, and acid phospatases (1.720 mg p-nitrophenol/ml * g of mycelium * hr) and alkaline phosphatases (1.360 mg p-nitrophenol/ml * g of mycelium * hr) at pH 4 and pH 11, respectively.

  abstract={Soil microbes constitute an important control on nitrogen (N) turnover and retention in arctic ecosystems where N availability is the main constraint on primary production. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbioses may facilitate plant competition for the specific N pools available in various arctic ecosystems. We report here our study on the N uptake patterns of coexisting plants and microbes at two tundra sites with contrasting dominance of the circumpolar ECM shrub Betula nana. We added equimolar mixtures of glycine-N, NH4 +-N and NO3--N, with one N form labelled with 15N at a time, and in the case of glycine, also labelled with 13C, either directly to the soil or to ECM fungal ingrowth bags. After 2 days, the vegetation contained 5.6, 7.7 and 9.1% (heath tundra) and 7.1, 14.3 and 12.5% (shrub tundra) of the glycine-, NH4+ - and NO3- -15N, respectively, recovered in the plant-soil system, and the major part of 15N in the soil was immobilized by microbes (chloroform fumigation-extraction). In the subsequent 24 days, microbial N turnover transferred about half of the immobilized 15N to the non-extractable soil organic N pool, demonstrating that soil microbes played a major role in N turnover and retention in both tundra types. The ECM mycelial communities at the two tundras differed in N-form preferences, with a higher contribution of glycine to total N uptake at the heath tundra; however, the ECM mycelial communities at both sites strongly discriminated against NO3- . Betula nana did not directly reflect ECM mycelial N uptake, and we conclude that N uptake by ECM plants is modulated by the N uptake patterns of both fungal and plant components of the symbiosis and by competitive interactions in the soil. Our field study furthermore showed that intact free amino acids are potentially important N sources for arctic ECM fungi and plants as well as for soil microorganisms. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Fungi with dematiaceous septate hyphae, termed dark septate endophytes (DSE), are common in plant roots, particularly in cold-stressed habitats, but their effects on their host plants remain obscure. Here, we report a study that assessed the effects of six DSE on the growth and nutrient balance of Deschampsia antarctica when plants were supplied with the same amount of nitrogen in organic (casein hydrolysate) or inorganic (ammonium sulphate) form under controlled conditions. After 60 days, the DSE, that had each been isolated from D. antarctica and which analyses of internal transcribed spacer and large subunit regions indicated were similar to members of the Helotiales (Oculimacula yallundae, Mollisia and Tapesia spp.) and unassigned anamorphic ascomycetes, typically had no effect on, or reduced by 33-71%, shoot and root dry weights relative to uninoculated controls when plants had been supplied with nitrogen in inorganic form. In contrast, the DSE usually enhanced shoot and root dry weights by 51-247% when plants had been supplied with organic nitrogen. In the presence of inorganic nitrogen, only sporadic effects of DSE were recorded on shoot and root nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations, whereas in the presence of organic nitrogen, three to six of the DSE isolates increased shoot and root nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Most of the isolates decreased the phosphorus concentrations of shoots and roots when plants had been supplied with nitrogen in organic form. Our data suggest that DSE are able to mineralise peptides and amino acids in the rhizosphere, making nitrogen more freely available to roots. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

  abstract={Current knowledge concerning 'decomposer' Basidiomycota in Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems is based on two sources: (a) collections and surveys of basidiomata, which have resulted in high-quality catalogues of species, although much of the species' distribution and ecology are tentative and (b) isolations from soils and plant litter which typically result in a "low incidence of basidiomycetes" [Dowding, P., Widden, P., 1974. Some relations between fungi and their environment in tundra regions. In: Holding, A.J., Heal, O.W., MacLean Jr., S.F., Flanagan, P.W. (Eds.), Soil Organisms and Decomposition in Tundra. Tundra Biome Steering Committee, Stockholm, Sweden, pp. 123-150], probably because of selectivity in isolation methods. In the few molecular studies carried out in Arctic and Antarctic soils to date, basidiomycetes, particularly yeasts, have been found. These techniques should give better estimates of the order of magnitude of fungal species richness in Arctic and Antarctic soils, although caution should be used concerning primer choice and amplification conditions. From collections in Arctic regions, species of basidiomycetes appear to be circumpolar in distribution with restricted endemism. Using culture-independent methods, it should be possible to test whether selected Arctic or Antarctic species are truly cosmopolitan, circumpolar, endemic, or are cryptic phylogenetic species. Particularly in Arctic ecosystems, potential 'decomposer' fungi in soils and roots may be from phylogenetically diverse taxa, and currently it is unclear whether 'decomposer' basidiomycetes are the fungi undertaking the majority of organic matter decomposition in Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems. For example, in some recent studies, wood decomposition in cold Arctic and Antarctic sites appears to proceed via 'soft rot' by anamorphic ascomycetes (e.g. Cadophora species), rather than by 'white rot' or 'brown rot' basidiomycete species. Additionally, it appears basidiomycetes and ascomycetes as ericoid and ectomycorrhizal fungi have the potential to be involved directly in decomposition. Given that profound changes are likely to occur in patterns of vegetation (Arctic and Antarctic) and size of soil carbon (C) pools (particularly in the Arctic) by the end of this century, it is necessary to know more about which species of 'decomposer' basidiomycetes are present and to try to define their potentially pivotal roles in ecosystem C (and N) cycling. One solution to characterise further the identity and roles of these fungi in a logical way, is to standardise methods of detection and 'function' at networks of sites, including along latitudinal gradients. Results of functional tests should be related to community structure, at least for 'key' species. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Each of these fungi responded differently to suboptimal growth temperatures. At low temperatures Humicola marvinii accumulated cryoprotective carbohydrates (trehalose intracellularly and glycerol extracellularly), whereas Geomyces pannorum responded by altering its lipid composition with increases in unsaturated lipid content and overall unsaturation index. In the case of Mortierella elongata, features that may influence its ability to grow at low temperatures included the absence of detectable ergosterol, the presence of stearidonic acid and increased amounts of intracellular trehalose when grown at lower temperatures. The relative importance of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in adaptation to temperature stress in these fungi is discussed.},

  abstract={There is some evidence that microbes inhabiting permanently frozen environments are capable of cell maintenance and growth under in situ conditions. In contrast, Arctic tundra surface soils that are only frozen during the winter have exhibited CO2 respiration under frozen conditions. This could result from maintenance metabolism fuelled by recycling cell material, but does necessarily indicate growth, which requires the synthesis of new cell material. We used 13C-glucose to trace C into membrane lipids and 5-bromo-3-deoxyuridine to monitor DNA synthesis in a laboratory microcosm study on Arctic tundra soils. Organisms were not equally active: fungi incorporated more C than any other group. Although some bacteria were growing, Gram(+) bacteria were almost completely inactive. Shrub tundra microbes were more active in early winter than tussock microbes, incorporating more C and synthesizing more DNA. In late winter, the C incorporation pattern reversed, although DNA production was similar. We demonstrated for the first time that microbes in frozen tundra soils synthesized new cell membranes and DNA, processes fundamentally associated with growth. That microbes can grow during Arctic winters may have important implications for C cycle modelling under a changing climate. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract={Soils in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica are considered to be among the world's most extreme environments. These soils are old, cold and dry with low contents of organic carbon and nitrogen. Habitats adjacent to water (lakes and ice melts) have significant biological activity as demonstrated by the presence of algal mats, lichens and small invertebrates, particularly nematodes, tardigrades and rotifers. In contrast, there are extensive areas in the Dry Valleys that are extremely dry with less than 5% moisture content. These soils are often salty and appear to be barren of life as they have a coarse texture due to their lack of plant organic material. In contrast, molecular techniques (DNA extraction from soils, cloning and rDNA sequence analysis) demonstrated the presence of a complex micro-eukaryotic food web whose structure and composition varied with moisture content and location. Micro-eukaryotic communities in soils with 0.2-1.3% moisture were represented by species of the yeast genus Trichosporon and an unidentified clade of micro-eukaryotes, whereas levels from 3.1% to 4.9% contained complex food webs including primary producers (chlorophytes and stramenopiles), symbionts (lichen associated fungi), saprophytes (fungi), predators (alveolates and cercozoans) and fungal nematode parasite/pathogens. The soils had a diversity of species (80 species from 15 sites) with a restricted number (3-21 species) at each site. The sensitive and measurable community structure of the low moisture Dry Valley soils provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine local and global environmental effects on micro-eukaryotic community dynamics with multiple trophic levels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract={The fungal floras of plant communities and mineral soils were determined at locations both close to and away from sites of human activity. Petroleum contaminated soils and discarded wood which occur near Stations were also studied, the former for bacterial as well as fungal colonization. The fungal floras of uncontaminated natural communities comprised relatively few species, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum and Thelebolus microsporus being the most common, together with Epicoccum nigrum at Mawson. P. herbarum dominated the fungal floras of mosses at Mossell Lake but E. nigrum was also common in Mawson mossbeds. G. pannorum was widespread and colonized a range of different habitats, particularly in the Vestfold Hills. T. microsporus was also widespread particularly at sites frequented by birds and seals. Phialophora fastigiata was common around the Stations, especially Davis Station, in soils including those contaminated with oil and in wood, and is thought to have been introduced with softwood packing crates. A greater range of taxa including Mortierella, Mucor, Penicillium and Cladosporium spp. was recorded from Mawson Station than from other sites, and this was attributed to the effects of human activity. Few fungi but a range of bacteria were isolated from the petroleum contaminated soils. A high percentage of these soils contained bacteria which could utilize hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source. Some of these bacteria showed a strong degradative potential, namely Flavobacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp. and an isolate from the family Enterobacteriaceae. One isolate of Corynebacterium and the Enterobacteriaceae isolate were active hydrocarbon degraders at 1°C. Hormoconis resinae, the imperfect state of Amorphotheca resinae was only isolated from oil spill soils and then only from sites of recent spills. Geomyces pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were less common in oil contaminated soils than in uncontaminated soils. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

This compared with an average of 12μg C g-1 in control samples from sites remote from penguin colonies. Biomass estimates based on substrate-induced-respiration rates were 1-4 times higher than the equivalent ATP estimates.

  abstract={Organic geochemical studies of 12 soil samples from Wright and Taylor Valleys of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Ross Desert) in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, were carried out. Long-chain n-alkanoic acids (C20-C34), with predominance of even-carbon numbers, were abundant in all the samples. 3-Hydroxy acids (C8-C30) with a predominance of even-carbon numbers were found in the samples, together with 2-, ω- and (ω-1)-hydroxy acids. α,ω-Dicarboxylic acids (C8-C31) were detected having near-unity values of carbon preference indices; mainly the C13 dicarboxylic acid predominated. Visual kerogen revealed that amorphous materials are major components (68-98%) with small amounts of very fine coals (2-32%), but no woody and herbaceous materials. The occurrence of mature isomers of steranes and triterpanes, the paucity of n-alkenoic acids and data from the microscopic study suggest that organic components in the soil samples are derived from erosion of Beacon Supergroup sedimentary rocks and past biological debris containing vascular plan waxes as well as wind-transported cyano-bacterial mats, including cyanobacteria, microalgae, bacteria and fungi, rather than from living organisms. © 1990.},

  abstract={A microbiological survey of 40 soils from contaminated and pristine localities of Mawson Base or the Vestfold Hills (Davis Base) is described. High microbial populations (from 106 to in excess of 109 cells g-1 dry soil) were associated with soil contaminated by man or animals, soil from beneath a moss bed, or soil from beneath translucent quartz pebbles and containing green algae. Lower microbial populations (generally between 104-106 cells g-1 soil) were associated with pristine soils lacking an identifiable primary producer. No correlation was evident between population density and soil particle size, moisture content, pH or salinity as determined by the electrical conductivity (E.C.) of soil suspensions, although relationships were evident between the components of the microflora and E.C. Microbial groups associated with low E.C. were chitinolytic bacteria, fungi and green algae; favoured by high E.C. were halotolerant bacteria. The microflora of uncontaminated soils appeared to be dominated by Gram-negative aerobic rods (68% of the total flora) with Moraxella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas being the most frequently isolated genera. The remaining microflora comprised Grampositive pleomorphic bacteria (mainly coryneforms), 13%; filamentous Gram-negative aerobic rods (morphologically akin to Bacillus species), 12%; and yeasts, 7%. Streptomyces was identified among the dominant microflora of only one soil. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were never isolated, although their presence was indicated in 40% of the soils tested by acetylene-reduction assay. Anaerobes were not detected in any soil using dilutionplate techniques, but were occasionally detected by enrichment in semi-solid media. All of 242 isolates obtained at 10° incubation were able to grow at 15°, 3.3% failed to grow at 18° and a further 9.5% failed to grow at 25°. Of 304 isolates obtained on one-tenth strength Trypticase-Soy agar (0.05% nutrient concentration), 10% failed to grow on the full-strength medium. Soils from the vicinity of Mawson or Davis bases contained a variety of fungi (Cladosporium, Chrysosporium, Acremonium, Phoma, Aureobasidium and Trichoderma species being isolated) in contrast to pristine soils, from which only Verticillium was occasionally isolated. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={The ability of four major species of trees of boreal forests, Betula pendula, Picea mariana, P. sitchensis and Pitius contorta, to utilize protein as a sole nitrogen source was compared when the plants were grown in mycorrhizal association with the fungus Hebeloma crustuliniforme and in the non‐mycorrhizal condition. When mycorrhizal, all species used protein N readily, producing vigorous shoots with nitrogen contents ranging from 5% in birch to around 3% in the conifers, and consuming up to 53% of the nitrogen provided in the culture vessels. In the absence of infection birch, black spruce and pine were completely unable to use protein as an N source and Sitka spruce had only a minimal ability to do so. It is suggested that early infection by fungi with proteolytic capability may be of particular importance for small seeded species germinating in soils of boreal and arctic regions where mineralization of nitrogen is inhibited by low temperatures.

  abstract={According to earlier observations, severe UV irradiation kills all micro-organisms in a chamber with simulated Martian conditions. However, even a thin soil layer protects buried micro-organisms from UV irradiation. The chief limiting factor for microbial multiplication under simulated Martian conditions seems to be soil humidity. Several micro-organisms were isolated from harsh environments (e.g., from Arctic, Antarctic desert and high-mountain soil samples). A strain of an oligonitrophilic mycococcus, isolated from Dixon Island, proved to be most resistant to low humidity. It multiplied in a mixture of limonite (maximal hygroscopical humidity 3.8%) + 2% (w/w) garden soil kept in a chamber simulating Martian conditions. Total cell count increased 7.6-fold and, in some experiments, 26-fold in 14 days. The oligonitrophilic mycococcus was able to grow even at a humidity level of 2.5%, that is less than maximal hygroscopical (3.8%). Under these conditions cell count increased 10-fold in 36 days. Thus, it was shown that even in Earth soils there are xerophytic micro-organisms which are able to multiply in limonite of low humidity. These data might correct our current concepts concerning microbial water requirements. One might speculate that Martian micro-organisms belong to xerophytic species.},

Twenty percent methanol spillage had two different effects on the surface vegetation, in that the vegetation was killed in some plots and not others. The applied methanol disappeared completely between 1 and 4 weeks. No increased soil activity (as indicated by respiration, bacterial numbers, fungal standing crop) was detected when methanol was present in the soil. Because only one bacterium (i.e. pink gram negative rods) metabolized only very small concentrations of methanol, it was concluded that biodegradation of methanol was not a significant agent affecting methanol loss from the soil. © 1978 D.

  abstract={Nostoc is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria that can form macroscopic or microscopic colonies and is common in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Much of the success of Nostoc in terrestrial habitats is related to its ability to remain desiccated for months or years and fully recover metabolic activity within hours to days after re‐hydration with liquid water. Nostoc can also withstand repeated cycles of freezing and thawing and, thus, is an important component of extreme terrestrial habitats in the Arctic and Antarctic. The ability to fix atmospheric N2can provide an advantage in nitrogen‐poor environments. Nostoc also has the ability to screen damaging ultraviolet light in terrestrial and shallow benthic habitats. The genus potentially could be important in paddy rice culture because it fixes nitrogen that may later be released and used by plants; it also may play a role in soil formation and may increase nitrogen input to natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The abilities to survive in terrestrial habitats and fix N2are important in symbiotic interactions with fungi (lichens), liverworts, hornworts, mosses, ferns, cycads, and the angiosperm Gunnera. Nostoc is somewhat resistant to predation; this probably is related to production of large amounts of sheath material, synthesis of microcystin‐like toxins by some strains, and formation of colonies that are too large for many algivores to consume. Some organisms can subsist on Nostoc, although it may not be a preferred food source. Lytic cyanophages also infect Nostoc, but little is known about population control of Nostoc in its natural environment, Late Precambrian fossils resembling Nostoc have been described, and Nostoc possibly has been an important component of many terrestrial and aquatic communities since that time.

  abstract={Soil collected from throughout the maritime Antarctic was analyzed to determine the effects of a range of abiotic and biotic soil parameters on the distribution of nematophagous fungi. Endoparasites were far more abundant than predatory fungi due to the greater efficiency of endoparasites in attracting and infecting nematodes, which resulted in a rapid completion of the infection cycle. This allowed endoparasites to colonise even the most exposed soil habitats where conditions favourable for nematode activity were restricted to only a few hours daily. 76% of all endoparasites isolated formed adhesive conidia. The success of this group of endoparasites was due to the ability of the conidia to attract nematodes. Spontaneous trap forming predators were far more abundant than nonspontaneous trap formers. The former have a clear competitive advantage over the latter, as they are able to attract nematodes to the conidia which subsequently germinate and form traps only when induced by direct chemical stimulation of nematodes. These predators are able to use internal reserves only and so rapidly respond to short periods when the soil is unfrozen and the nematodes are active. Although nematodes were utilized by all the species isolated, many were also capable of using Protozoa and Rotifera as a food source. While endoparasites were capable of infecting Rotifera, they were never observed infecting, or were isolated from soil containing, Protozoa. The distribution of endoparasites and spontaneous trap forming predators was largely independent of abiotic soil parameters. They were however significantly associated with the presence and abundance of suitable prey. These species survive solely on nematodes and therefore do not require prolonged periods of suitable soil conditions in order to produce vegetative mycelium to adsorb nutrients saprophytically from the soil, which is a significant ecological advantage over the other groups of microfungi found in the Antarctic. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

  abstract={Fifty nine moss and soil samples from the maritime and continental Antarctic were investigated for their ciliate fauna using the non- flooded Petri dish method. Collections were made from a variety of biotopes covering most principal soil and vegetation types of the region following a cline from 60°-78°S, i.e. of increasing climatic severity. Sixty four species were found: 51 in region A (Signy Island and Livingstone Island), 16 in region B (Antarctic Peninsula), and 14 in region C (continental Antarctic, viz. Ross Island and South Victoria Land). Twenty nine out of the 64 species were first records for the region, and 5 of them were new species. Mean species number per sample was markedly higher in region A (9.6) than in region B (1.0) and region C (0.9), reflecting a dramatic faunal pauperization with increasing climatic severity and, respectively, decreasing soil fertility. This is strengthened by the observation that all samples from region A contained ciliates, whereas they were lacking in half of the collections from regions B and C. This highly patchy distribution, as yet not found elsewhere, is very likely caused by the severe environment allowing few pioneers to establish permanent populations. As compared with temperate and tropical regions, the Antarctic ciliate species richness is decreased by at least one order of magnitude. The fauna is dominated by r - selected, bacteria and fungi feeding colpodids. The most frequent species were Colpoda ecaudata, C. steini, C. inflata, Pseudocyrtolophosis alpestris, Pseudoplatyophrya nana, and Cyclidium muscicola, clearly proving Smith's (1973a) bi-polar biogeography of Colpoda to be a methodological artifact. Nine ciliate species are described or redescribed using standard methods: Pleuroplitoides smithi sp. n., Protospathidium serpens, Cyclidium glaucoma, Notohymena antarctica sp. n., Sterkiella thompsoni sp. n., Urosomoida granulifera sp. n., U. antarctica sp. n., Oxytricha lanceolata, and Paruroleptus notabilis. The genera Pleuroplites Foissner, 1988 and Pleuroplitoides gen. n. (dorsal brush isomorphic and composed of 2 rows with paired, shortened cilia) are united in the family Pleuroplitidae fam. n. (Acropisthiina with extracytostomal extrusome bundle on ventral side; dorsal brush composed of few isomorphic or many heteromorphic kineties).},

  abstract={The isoetid life‐form was originally defined on morphological grounds; subsequent physiological investigations showed that all of the isoetids examined took up a large fraction of the inorganic C fixed in their leaves from the root medium under natural conditions, and that some of them carried out much of their assimilation of inorganic C via a CAM‐like mechanism. Root‐dominated uptake of inorganic C appeared to be unique to, and ubiquitous in, the isoetids. I However, a large capacity for CAM‐like metabolism in submerged vascular plants is not universal in isoetids, nor is it restricted to this life‐form, being also found in Crassulaa aquatica. The work described here shows that submerged specimens of the North American Eriocaulon decangulare have a high fraction of their dry weight in the root system, a trait characteristic of isoetids but uncommon in other submerged vascular plants. E. decangulare has vesicular‐arbuscular mycorrhizas, as do other flowering plant isoetids hut not, generally, submerged Isoetes spp. Under conditions of natural supply of inorganic C, E. decangulare, like other isoetids, takes up most of its inorganic C through its roots. Uptake of inorganic C by both roots and shoots involves CO2 rather than HCO3: photosynthesis at high external pH values does not exceed the rate of uncatalysed HCO3‐ to CO2 conversion in the medium and there is no detectable extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity. Measurements of titratable acidity and of malate content of leaves sampled at dawn and at dusk showed that E. decangulare, growing and tested under either emersed or submersed conditions, did not exhibit CAM‐like behaviour. CAM was also absent from three non‐isoetid aquatic macrophytes (Amphibolic antarctica, Eeklonia radiata and Vallisneria spiralis) which were examined. E. decangulare thus resembles all other isoetids tested in acquiring much of its inorganic C via the root system. E. decangulare also resembles most of the isoetids which are not members of the Isoetaceae (e.g.) E. septangulare, Lobelia dortmanna and Subularia aquatica) but differs from submerged Isoetaceae and Littorella uniflora in lacking CAM. The ecological significance of uptake of CO2 via the roots and, where it occurs, of CAM in isoetids may be related to either inorganic C or, via improved N use efficiency, inorganic C as a limiting resource. The isoetid life‐forms has evolved independently in at last five different families of vascular plants; it probably derived fairly immediately from terrestrial or amphibious ancestors with a similar rosette form. Emergent Isoetaceae with acquisition of CO2 via roots and CAM probably evolved from submerged isoetids. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  abstract={Among the well-known ultrasaline terrestrial habitats, the Dead Sea in the Jordan Rift Valley and Don Juan Pond in the Upper Wright Valley represent two of the most extreme. The former is a saturated sodium chloride-magnesium sulfate brine in a hot desert, the latter a saturated calcium chloride brine in an Antarctic desert. Both Dead Sea and Don Juan water bodies themselves are limited in microflora, but the saline Don Juan algal mat and muds contain abundant nutrients and a rich and varied microbiota, including Oscillatoria, Gleocapsa, Chlorella, diatoms, Penicillium and bacteria. In such environments, the existence of an array of specific adaptations is a common, and highly reasonable, presumption, at least with respect to habitat-obligate forms. Nevertheless, many years of ongoing study in our laboratory have demonstrated that lichens (e.g. Cladonia), algae (e.g. Nostoc) and fungi (e.g. Penicillium, Aspergillus) from the humid tropics can sustain metabolism down to -40°C and growth down to -10°C in simulated Dead Sea or Don Juan (or similar) media without benefit of selection or gradual acclimation. Non-selection is suggested in fungi by higher growth rates from vegetative inocula than spores. The importance of nutrient parameters was also evident in responses to potassium and reduced nitrogen compounds. In view of the saline performance of tropical Nostoc, and its presence in the Antarctic dry valley soils, its complete absence in our Don Juan mat samples was and remains a puzzle. We suggest that adaptive capability is already resident in many terrestrial life forms not currently in extreme habitats, a possible reflection of evolutionary selection for wide spectrum environmental adaptability. © 1984 D.

  abstract={The aim of this investigation was to provide a general description of the biota and environment of fumarolic ground close to the summit (2733 m) of Mt Melbourne. Heat flow through the ground was examined and analyses made of the physico-chemical properties of the soil. Bryophyte vegetation comprised Campylopus pyriformis (K.F. Schultz) Brid. and Cephaloziella exiliflora (Tayl.) Steph. The former is a new antarctic record. These grew as scattered and confluent cushions where surface ground temperatures ranged between 14°-31°C. Algae were epiphytic on bryophytes and formed crusts over most other areas of warm ground. Six species of cyanophytes and five unicellular chlorophytes are described. The majority were mesophilic but Mastigocladus laminosus showed a strong preference for soil temperatures >30°C. A loosely lichenised chlorophyte was also encountered. The only soil fauna was a testate amoeba, Corythion dibium. Heterotrophic microorganisms included thermotolerant fungi, actinomycetes and bacteria as well as typical mesophilic microflora. Nitrogen fixation, analysed using both C2H2 reduction and15N2 enrichment, occured in bryophyte cushions and surface algal crusts containing M. laminosus and in sub-surface samples lacking cyanophytes. The biota are compared with those found at other thermal localities in Antarctica and the dispersal of propagules to these areas is discussed. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Roots of 76 plant species collected in West Spitsbergen (Svalbard), in the middle-northern Arctic zone, were examined for mycorrhiza and root-associated fungi. Dryas octopetala, Pedicularis dasyantha and Salix polaris were ectomycorrhizal and Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum hermaphroditum ericoid mycorrhizal. Pedicularis dasyantha was only slightly infected. Structures resembling vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi were not found in the roots, and soil samples screened for VAM fungi contained only one spore. Root endophytic fungi commonly occurred in Spits-bergen, but only Olpidium brassicae, Pleospora herbarum, Papulaspora, Microdochium bolleyi and Rhizoctonia solani were identified with reasonable certainty. A sterile endophytic dark-septate fungus (DSF) was in 39.5% of the flowering-plant species examined, especially in the Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Saxifragaceae and Poaceae. DSF were categorized into four slightly overlapping groups. Sterile endophytic hyaline septate fungi were rare. In the literature it is suggested that at least some of the DSF species or the hyaline septate fungi are functionally mutualistic rather than saprophytic or pathogenic. The literature on ectomycorrhizal fungi and plants in Spitsbergen is reviewed, including about 50 species, mainly of the genera Cortinarius, Hebeloma, Inocybe, Laccaria, Lactarius and Russula. These are symbiotic with the above-mentioned ectomycorrhizal plants. Four further ectomycorrhizal plants (Betula nana, Salix spp.) are very rare in the area. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Previous research has shown that plant extracts, e.g. from boreal dwarf shrubs and trees, can cause reduced growth of neighbouring plants: an effect known as allelopathy. To examine whether arctic and subarctic plants could also be affected by leaching of phytochemicals, we added extracts from the commonly occurring arctic dwarf shrubs Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum hermaphroditum, and from mountain birch, Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa to three graminoid species, Carex bigelowii, Festuca vivipara and Luzula arcuata, grown in previously sterilized or non-sterilized arctic soils. The graminoids in non-sterilized soil grew more slowly than those in sterilized soil. Excised roots of the plants in non-sterilized soil had higher uptake rate of labelled P than those in sterilized soil, demonstrating larger nutrient deficiency. The difference in growth rate was probably caused by higher nutrient availability for plants in soils in which the microbial biomass was killed after soil sterilization. The dwarf shrub extracts contained low amounts of inorganic N and P and medium high amounts of carbohydrates. Betula extracts contained somewhat higher levels of N and much higher levels of P and carbohydrates. Addition of leaf extracts to the strongly nutrient limited graminoids in non-sterilized soil tended to reduce growth, whereas in the less nutrient limited sterilized soil it caused strong growth decline. Furthermore, the N and P uptake by excised roots of plants grown in both types of soil was high if extracts from the dwarf shrubs (with low P and N concentrations) had been added, whereas the P uptake declined but the N uptake increased after addition of the P-rich Betula extract. In contrast to the adverse extract effects on plants, soil microbial respiration and soil fungal biomass (ergosterol) was generally stimulated, most strongly after addition of the Betula extract. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the reduced plant growth and the concomitant stimulation of microbial activity were caused by phytochemicals, we believe that this was more likely due to labile carbon in the extracts which stimulated microbial biomass and activity. As a result microbial uptake increased, thereby depleting the plant available pool of N and P, or, for the P-rich Betula extract, depleting soil inorganic N alone, to the extent of reducing plant growth. This chain of events is supported by the negative correlation between plant growth and sugar content in the three added extracts, and the positive correlation between microbial activity, fungal biomass production and sugar content, and are known reactions when labile carbon is added to nutrient deficient soils. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={The linear growth rates of fungal isolates were measured on agar plates at temperatures ranging from 4° to 35°C. Fungi tested included the major fungal colonizers of leaves and litter of the three dominant plant species on subantarctic Macquarie Island, and major fungal species associated with plant and soil communities near Australia's Casey Station on the Antarctic Continent. All fungi grew at 4°C and were classified as psychrotrophs. Maximum growth rates were recorded at temperatures of 10° to 20°C for 13 of the 15 isolates from Macquarie Island and for all six isolates from Casey. Most of the leaf colonizing fungi from Macquarie Island had optimum growth temperatures of 15°C whereas all litter fungi from Macquarie Island and Casey fungi except Thelebolus microsporus had optimum growth temperatures of 20°C or above. Maximum growth of all species was at temperatures above those normally prevailing in their natural environments, with most species growing at 4°C at between 10% and 30% of their maximum rates. However, microclimatic effects may have resulted at times in temperatures near their growth optima. The highest growth rates at 4°C were recorded for Phoma spp. 1 and 2, Phoma exigua and Mortierella gamsii from Macquarie Island and Mortierella sp. 1 from Casey. Thelebolus microsporus and sterile sp. G from Casey also grew relatively fast at 4°C, and these species, and Phoma sp. 3 and Phoma exigua from Macquarie Island had the lowest Q-10 values for the temperature range 4° to 15°C. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={Endoparasitic and predatory nematophagous fungi are widely distributed throughout the maritime Antarctic, being recorded along the Antarctic Peninsula as far south as 68° S. Fungi were recorded from 71% of the sites examined with Cephalosporium balanoides and Dactylaria gracilis being the commonest recorded endoparasite and predator, respectively. Endoparasites with adhesive and nematode-attracting conidia were shown to be more abundant and to have a competitive advantage in the Antarctic ecosystem over those parasites requiring their conidia to be ingested before infection could occur. Predators able to form traps spontaneously on germination were shown to be far more abundant than those species with a more saprophytic mode of existence, with constricting rings being the most commonly isolated trapping mechanism. Species capturing nematodes by three-dimensional networks were restricted to bird-associated sites indicating that they are able to grow saprophytically in such organically enriched material. Nematophagous basidiomycetes and phycomycetes were absent except for a single Myzocytium sp. isolated from heated soil. © 1984 Dr W. Junk Publishers.},

CA markedly inhibited radiolabeled thymidine and uridine transport in mouse Ehrlich carcinoma cells, its 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) being 4.6 and 7.7 μM, respectively. In clonogenic assay, CA displayed a synergistic effect with methotrexate (MTX), mitomycin C (MMC), 5-fluorouracil (5FU), and Adriamycin (ADR) against human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB cells. CA also markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect of 5FU and ADR on the proliferation of human hepatoma BEL-7402 cells as determined by the p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (NAG) enzyme-reaction assay. 5FU or ADR cytotoxicity was not augmented by CA in human fetal lung 2BS cells. In vivo, CA significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of MMC against colon carcinoma 26 in mice. No significant augmentation of toxicity by the combination was found in treated mice.

  abstract={The environmental conditions prevailing on Mars would supposedly favour the existence there of micro-organisms belonging to xerophiles, anaerobes, or micro-aerophiles, oligonitrophiles, which are able to grow in wide temperature intervals. From soil samples taken in deserts and tundra, antarctic halophilic bacteria, able to grow in liquid media containing 20-25% of sodium chloride, were isolated. Some of these cultures appeared to be also osmophilic (growth on media with 50% glucose); they grew at temperatures from 5 degrees C to 50 degrees C, and developed on media without a nitrogen source (oligonitrophiles). Of special interest was the halophilic and osmophilic form of Bacillus megaterium isolated from the Nubian desert. In experiments with this bacterium the following technique was used. A thin film of potato extract agar was prepared on a glass slide and dried over a saturated K2SO4 solution in a closed container up to the level of maximal hygroscopic moisture. The cell suspension was then sprayed on to the agar surface, the film dried again at 45 degrees C, and the glass slide put in the test tube over the saturated solution of K2SO4. The test tube was evacuated, flushed three times with a gas mixture containing 80% CO2 plus 20% Ar, and sealed. Under these conditions the water content of the agar film was equal to the maximal hygroscopic moisture; only the xerophilic form of bacteria are able to develop at this moisture level. This halophilic strain of Bac. megaterium grew satisfactorily under these conditions, as did a halophilic and osmophilic strain of Mycococcus ruber isolated in Antarctica. Both the halophilic strain of Bac. megaterium and that of M. ruber were able to grow under simulated Martian conditions. Xerophily and halophily may be linked. This assumption was supported by relatively high incidence of xerophilic forms among halophilic bacteria isolated from different soils of both high and low salt content as well as from salty muds.},

  abstract={Rock varnish occurs in virtually all environments, most commonly in arid and semi‐arid climates, including Antarctica. Rock varnish consists of thin layers of intimately mixed aeolian and chemical sediments often showing botryoidal and more rarely stromatolite‐like morphologies. Typical rock varnish samples collected at Twin Peak Mountain Park, near Phoenix, Arizona, consist of abundant quartz, with plagioclase, illite and a mixed layer, Fe‐clay mineral, probably corrensite. EDS, SEM (BSE) and TEM analyses revealed that the typical Mn, Fe minerals occur as minute particles; some of these particles and other mineral grains are attached to filaments. XRD and electron diffraction showed that the Mn.Fe‐bearing particles are poorly crystalline. The filaments, based on morphological criteria, are virtually indistinguishable from fungal filaments. Most filaments are fragments, probably broken by scraping during sample collection. Coccoid and rod‐shaped forms, resembling cyanobacteria and other bacteria, respectively, are also present. Unlike definitive minerals, these filaments disintegrated in the concentrated energy of the SEM electron beam at the instrumental and experimental conditions used. In addition, no filamentous, rod‐shaped or coccoid forms were observed in samples hydrolysed with 6 N HCl for 24 h at 100°C. Bacteria and fungi in powdered rock varnish were cultured on four media, incubated aerobically in the dark at 25°C. The culture media yielded dense growths of spore‐forming bacteria and filamentous fungi. One fungus and two Bacillus isolates oxidized and concentrated manganese. Control experiments revealed that fungi and bacteria are present on and below the surfaces of rock varnish. Free and hydrolysed, peptide/protein‐bound amino acids were identified in the rock varnish. Amino acids showed virtually no racemization with the exception of D/L asp = 0.1. Relatively high molecular weight humic matter was also separated from the rock varnish. High‐resolution mass spectrometry revealed non‐hydrocarbon moieties, similar to a Suwannee River (FL) humic acid standard. Micro‐organisms and their original biochemical compounds do not seem to be preserved for long in the accreting varnish layer. The studies showed that the filaments helped to trap mineral particles of rock varnish, and that bacteria and fungi abetted Mn concentration. Some structures in the layers of rock varnish resemble stromatolites and present definitions would allow them to be termed as such. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  abstract={SUMMARY.  1. Several dozen summer meltwater streams are located in the McMurdo Sound region (c. 78°S 165°E) of southern Victoria Land. They are characterized by a highly variable flow regime at diel, seasonal and annual times caleis; wide fluctuations in temperature and nutrient content; and a very simple epilithic community of cyanophytes (Nostoc spp., Oscillatoriaceae), bacteria, fungi and microherbivores. 2. The epilithon survives the dark Antarctic winter as dry, frozen mats which provide a large inoculum for growth the following summer. This overwintering assemblage retains a high metabolic capacity and responds rapidly to rehydration. 3. In a series of artificial substrate experiments, biomass accumulation rates were generally less than 0.1 In units d−1. Colonization and growth on the substrates was inversely related to the suspended sediment load of the stream. There was also a visual correspondence between per cent algal cover of the natural streambed and the clarity of the streamwater. Sloughing losses may limit community biomass, particularly in the turbid flowing waters. 4. During running water conditions the mature communities had very low gross photosynthetic rates per unit chlorophyll (<0,1 μg C (μg chl a.h)−1 and per unit carbon (<0,2 μg C (mg biomass C.h)−1). Respiration was generally a high percentage (up to 92%) of gross photosynthesis, which probably reflected the high population densities of microheterotrophs in the community. 5. The floristically simple epilithic mats slowly accumulate to extreme biomass levels (>20 μg chl a cm −2, <20 mg C cm−2). Production rates per unit biomass are low, probably in response to the cold temperatures of the Antarctic stream environment, and the accumulated biomass represents several seasons of growth.
