AB  - The actinobacterial diversity of Arctic marine sediments was investigated using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. A total of 152 strains were isolated from seven different media; 18 isolates were selected for phylogenetic analysis on the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Results showed that the 18 isolates belonged to a potential novel genus and 10 known genera including Actinotalea, Arthrobacter, Brachybacterium, Brevibacterium, Kocuria, Kytococcus, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Mycobacterium, and Pseudonocardia. Subsequently, 172 rDNA clones were selected by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis from 692 positive clones within four actinobacteria-specific 16S rDNA libraries of Arctic marine sediments, and then these 172 clones were sequenced. In total, 67 phylotypes were clustered in 11 known genera of actinobacteria including Agrococcus, Cellulomonas, Demequina, Iamia, Ilumatobacter, Janibacter, Kocuria, Microbacterium, Phycicoccus, Propionibacterium, and Pseudonocardia, along with other, unidentified actinobacterial clones. Based on the detection of a substantial number of uncultured phylotypes showing low BLAST identities (< 95 %), this study confirms that Arctic marine environments harbour highly diverse actinobacterial communities, many of which appear to be novel, uncultured species.

AB  - The abundance and diversity of filamentous fungi in the bottom sediments of the Arctic Ocean seas (the Greenland, Barents, and Kara seas) were studied. Samples of the surface bottom sediments were collected during the 84th (July-August 2021) and 86th (October-November 2021) cruises of RV Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. The taxonomic affiliation of the isolated fungi was determined using polyphasic taxonomy. The isolated fungi belonged to 16 genera of different classes of ascomycetous, basidiomycetous, and zygomycetous fungi. The effect of cultivation temperature and different NaCl concentrations on fungal growth was determined, as well as the effect of cultivation conditions on the fatty acid profile for the strains capable of growth on media with increased osmotic potential. While fatty acid composition was shown to be affected by changes in environmental conditions, the response to osmotic stress differed among the studied cultures from deep-sea sediments.

AB  - This study assessed the diversity and distribution of fungal communities in eight marine sediments of Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, High Arctic) using 454 pyrosequencing with fungal-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene. Sedimentary fungal communities showed high diversity with 42,219 reads belonging to 113 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Of these OTUs, 62 belonged to the Ascomycota, 26 to Basidiomycota, 2 to Chytridiomycota, 1 to Zygomycota, 1 to Glomeromycota, and 21 to unknown fungi. The major known orders included Hypocreales and Saccharomycetales. The common fungal genera were Pichia, Fusarium, Alternaria, and Malassezia. Interestingly, most fungi occurring in these Arctic sediments may originate from the terrestrial habitats and different basins in Kongsfjorden (i.e., inner basin, central basin, and outer basin) harbor different sedimentary fungal communities. These results suggest the existence of diverse fungal communities in the Arctic marine sediments, which may serve as a useful community model for further ecological and evolutionary study of fungi in the Arctic.

AB  - Extreme cold environments like glaciers, present substantial obstacles to the survival of organisms. Cryoconite, dark sediment covering glacier, provide unique niche for microorganisms. Therefore, we focused on understanding the diversity of fungi in Arctic ecosystems (Hansbreen, Spitsbergen), which is important in the analysis of the structure and of fungi populations. Due to a combination of two incubation temperatures (7 degrees C or 24 degrees C) and two media during isolation (potato dextrose agar, PDA or yeast extract peptone glucose, YPG), and classical/molecular identification approaches, we identified 20 different fungi (17 species and three unassigned species). Most belonged to filamentous fungi within the Ascomycota (19 isolates), with one identified as Basidiomycota-yeast. Regarding growth conditions, both media yielded greater number of fungal cultures at 24 degrees C compared to 7 degrees C. Additionally, PDA was more effective than YPG in isolating fungal cultures. On the other hand, the optimal temperature for achieving the highest CFU (colony-forming unit)/g of sediment was 7 degrees C. The most frequently isolated species was Cladosporium cladosporioides, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to detect, the following species in an Arctic environment: Aspergillus jensenii, A. tennesseensis, Peziza varia, and Trichoderma paraviridescens. Additionally, there was a visible increase in the number of fungal propagules but a decrease in their biodiversity towards the upper parts of the glacier. Considering the Arctic amplification there is a need for further research on diversity and function of fungi in glacial ecosystems.

AB  - Two strains of a psychrophilic basidiomycetous yeast species belonging to the genus Vishniacozyma were isolated from sediments and soil at the front of a retreating glacier on northern Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. Analysis of the large subunit D1/D2 region and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the rDNA indicated that these strains represented a novel species. The closest relatives of the novel species were Vishniacozyma globispora and V. dimennae, which exhibited sequence similarities of 82.2 and 81.6 %, respectively, to the ITS region of the novel species, and contained 61 and 57 nt substitutions, respectively, in the D1/D2 domain, in comparison with the novel species. Strains of the novel species were able to grow at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free medium. These characteristics allow the strains to survive and grow in perennially cold, oligotrophic habitats in the Canadian High Arctic. The name Vishniacozyma ellesmerensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JCM 32573(T) (=UAMH 11973(T) =G3-4-8(T)) and the MycoBank number is MB825501.

AB  - A fungal strain, Penicillium chrysogenum A096, was isolated from an Arctic sediment sample. Its culture supernatant inhibited mycelial growth of some plant pathogenic fungi. After saturation of P. chrysogenum A096 culture supernatant with ammonium sulfate and ion exchange chromatography, a novel antifungal protein (Pc-Arctin) was purified and identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS). The gene encoding for Pc-Arctin consisting of 195 nucleotides was cloned from P. chrysogenum A096 to confirm the mass spectrometry result. Pc-Arctin displays antifungal activity against Paecilomyces variotii, Alternaria longipes, and Trichoderma viride at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 24, 48, and 192 ng/disc, respectively. Pc-Arctin was most sensitive to proteinase K and then to trypsin but insensitive to papain. Pc-Arctin possesses high thermostability and cannot be antagonized by common surfactants, except for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Divalent ions, such as Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+, inhibited the antifungal activity of Pc-Arctin. Hemagglutination assays showed that Pc-Arctin had no hemagglutinating or hemolytic activity against red blood cells (RBC) from rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs. Therefore, Pc-Arctin from Arctic P. chrysogenum may represent a novel antifungal protein with potential for application in controlling plant pathogenic fungal infection.

AB  - Few studies have addressed the diversity of cultivable fungi from marine sediments, especially those from Antarctica. In the present study, we evaluated the presence and distribution of cultivable fungi in marine core sediments obtained from 100, 500, 700 and 1,100 m below the Antarctic Ocean surface. Fifty-two fungal isolates were identified as Penicillium solitum by their physiological and morphological characteristics, and the identity of 12 representative isolates was further confirmed by sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and beta-tubulin genes. P. solitum displayed high sequence similarity to Penicillium taxa that have been described from other marine habitats. Conidial germination of P. solitum occurred at low temperatures and high salinities. In addition, P. solitum displayed extracellular amylasic and esterasic activities. The isolation of P. solitum from marine sediments in Antarctica and its survival at low temperatures and high salt concentrations suggest that it is adapted to the cold and halophilic environment of the Antarctic oceans. Because P. solitum produces extracellular enzymes, it is an interesting eukaryotic model for the study of structure-function relationships during enzymatic biocatalysis and biotransformation under extreme conditions. Marine sediments from Antarctica may represent a unique source for obtaining extremophilic fungi. New studies using different culture media, temperatures ranges and pressure conditions as well as metagenomic techniques can assist in understanding the extremophilic fungal communities in marine sediments across the Antarctic Ocean.

AB  - The mycobiota of bottom sediments at depths of 128-472 m was investigated in Barents and Kara sea areas remote from the shore. The species composition and fungal abundance, that is, the number of fungal colony-forming units (CFUs), were determined in 5 samples from the Kara Sea and in 14 samples of the Barents Sea. For the first time for the Arctic seas, the fungal biomass was determined in 12 samples of the bottom sediments from the Barents Sea. It was found that fungal abundance in the bottom sediments of the both seas did not exceed 13 CFUs per 1 g of dry substrate weight. In total, only 58 colonies of filamentous fungi belonging to 22 morphotypes, 8 of which were sterile, were isolated from all the samples. No more than six morphotypes were contained in 1 g of dried substrate; they were mostly species of the genus Cladosporium and sterile isolates. The study of the fungal biomass detected both spores and fungal mycelium in the bottom sediments. The total biomass was extremely low and ranged from 0.1 to 0.620 mg/g of the studied substrate. Small spores (with a diameter less than 3 mu m) absolutely predominated (from 88 to 99.7% of the biomass).

AB  - We present the first study on the quantity and diversity of the mycobiota in bottom sediments of the Chukchi Sea. During implementation of the RUSALCA-2012 program, 22 samples of bottom sediments from depths of 44-110 m were collected in late August-early September 2012. Fungi were isolated on agarized media (salinity 35 psu, temperature 6 degrees C). Species identification was performed by morphological-cultural and molecular-genetic methods based on the nucleotide sequences of ITS1-ITS2 rDNA. A total of 128 colonies of mycelial fungi were isolated; 0 to 22 propagules were obtained from each 1 cm(3) sample. The overall diversity was represented by 48 morphotypes belonging to 32 genera in 15 orders of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. Ascomycetes predominated both in number and diversity. A number of species were found in marine ecosystems for the first time. The taxonomic position of nonsporulating isolates (13% of the total) was established using molecular techniques. Among them, high diversity was observed in the orders Pleosporales and Helotiales (Ascomycota).

AB  - Four strains isolated from sediment sampled at the front of a retreating glacier on northern Ellesmere Island in the Canadian high Arctic, namely JCM 32575(T), JCM 32576, JCM 32577 and JCM 32578, belong to a novel psychrophilic basidiomycetous yeast species in the genus Mrakia. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that these strains are most closely related to the type strains of Mrakia aquatica and Mrakianic combsii, but with 8-9 and 7-12 nt substitutions in ITS and in the D1 /D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene, respectively. The strains grew at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free media, with lipase and cellulase highly active even at -3 degrees C. These characteristics likely allow this yeast species to grow and survive in extremely cold, oligotrophic environments, such as the fronts of retreating glaciers in the high Arctic. The name Mrakia hoshinonis sp. nov. is proposed, with type strain JCM 32575(T) (UAMH 11969) and MycoBank number MB 825484.

AB  - In the Arctic ecosystems, fungi are crucial for interactions between soil and plants, the cycling of nutrients, and the transport of carbon. To date, no studies have been conducted to thoroughly examine the mycobiome and its functional role in various habitats of the High Arctic region. The aim was to unravel the mycobiome in the nine habitats (i.e., soil, lichen, vascular plant, moss, freshwater, seawater, marine sediment, dung, and marine alga) in the Ny-angstrom lesund Region (Svalbard, High Arctic) using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 10,419 ASVs were detected. Among them, 7535 ASVs were assigned to unidentified phyla, while the remaining 2884 ASVs were assigned to 11 phyla, 33 classes, 81 orders, 151 families, 278 genera, and 261 species that were known. The distribution of the mycobiome was driven by habitat specificity, indicating that habitat filtering is a crucial factor influencing the fungal assemblages at a local scale in this High Arctic region. Six growth forms and 19 fungal guilds were found. The ecological guild (e.g., lichenized, ectomycorrhizal) and growth form (e.g., yeast, thallus photosynthetic) varied significantly among various habitats. In addition, the occurrence of 31 fungal species that are considered to be potential pathogens was determined. These results will increase our understanding of fungal diversity and its functional significance in this distinctive High Arctic area and thereby establish the groundwork for prediction about how the mycobiome will alter in various environments as a result of anticipated climate change.

AB  - Many filamentous fungi were isolated from the soils of Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and were screened in vitro for their phosphate solubilizing ability. Two strains of Aspergillus niger showed good tricalcium phosphate (TCP) solubilizing ability in Pikovskaya's medium. The TCP solubilization index was calculated at varying levels of pH and temperatures. The ability of Aspergillus niger strain-1 to solubilize and release inorganic-P was 285 mu g ml(-1), while Aspergillus niger strain-2 solubilized 262 mu g ml(-1) from 0.5% TCP after seven days. This is the first report of TCP solubilization by Arctic strains that may serve as very good phosphate solubilizers in the form of biofertilizer.

AB  - In recent years, the Arctic has become a hot spot for microbial research. However, fungal diversity in the Chukchi Sea (adjacent to the Arctic Ocean) is little known. The purpose of this study was to explore fungal diversity in sediments of the Chukchi Sea and the temperature adaptability of the cultured fungi. A total of 74 fungal strains were isolated from nine marine sediment samples collected from the Chukchi Sea. These fungi were identified based on morphological characteristics and sequence comparison of the internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) with the GenBank reference sequence database. Amongst these fungi, 61 strains belonged to the Ascomycota and 13 strains were affiliated with the Basidiomycota. The dominant genus was Penicillium. These fungal strains were cultured at 4 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 25 degrees C to determine their temperature adaptability. Most strains were able to grow at 4 degrees C, and Thelebolus ellipsoideus was identified as a psychrophilic fungus. Our results revealed a high fungal diversity in marine sediments of the Chukchi Sea and found that some fungal species (Penicillium chrysogenum, Eutypella scoparia, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium tenuissimum, C. perangustums and Thelebolus ellipsoideus) isolated from these sediments were able to grow at 10 degrees C and 4 degrees C.

AB  - The fungus Psychrophilomyces antarcticus M.M. Wang & Xing Z. Liu, previously known only from the QinghaiTibet Plateau and Antarctica, was isolated in the Arctic from sediments on the littoral of the Kara Sea (Shokalsky Island) and represented by strains VKM F-5025/CBS 151455 and VKM F-5026/CBS 151456. The macroand micro-morphology of the isolate was studied together with partial sequences of the DNA regions ITS, LSU, TEF1, and beta-TUB, as well as the optimal values for temperature, pH and salinity. Slight differences between our two isolates and previously known strains of P. antarcticus were found in morphology (colony color and shape, size of phialides and spores) and physiological traits (optimal growth temperature, range of acceptable temperature and pH values for growth, colony odor, and degree of mucosity under extreme conditions). However, the high similarity in the sequenced conservative DNA sequences from 100 to 97% indicates that these slight morphological and physiological variations of the studied strains of P. antarcticus are intraspecific variation. Our study demonstrates that P. antarcticus is a cold-adapted poly-extreme tolerant species that can occur and function in extremely cold areas, such as high alpine, Antarctic, and Arctic regions.

A total of 63 isolates of filamentous fungi belonging to 32 morphotypes were obtained from 35 sediment samples. Most morphotypes were represented by single colonies in individual samples; the most frequently occurring species were Pseudeurotiumzonatum, Pseudogymnoascuspannorum, and Cordycepsfarinos & acy;. In both seas, the abundance of filamentous fungi (up to 12 colonies per 1 g wet sediment) was lower than that of yeasts (up to 68 colonies per 1 g wet sediment). In the Laptev Sea, yeast abundance was low at all stations, while in the East Siberian Sea higher values were found at near-estuarine stations.

AB  - The fungus strain SCSIO 40433 was isolated from an Arctic-derived glacier sediment sample and characterized as Tolypocladium cylindrosporum. A new compound, cylindromicin (1), and seven known secondary metabolites (2-8) were isolated from this strain. The chemical structures of these compounds were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses. Cylindromicin (1) featured a 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran skeleton. The absolute configuration of compound 1 was assigned via interpretation of key Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) correlations and Electronic Circular Dichroism (ECD) calculation. Cylindromicin (1) exhibited significant tyrosinase inhibition activity. This study highlights Polar fungi as a potential resource for new bioactive natural products.

AB  - Despite feather fungi being an important component of the Arctic fungal flora, their ecological role and diversity are not fully known. In the current study, fungal cultures were isolated from feathers (barnacle goose, common eider, and glaucous gull) collected in the Ny-lesund region, Svalbard. Isolates were identified by ITS region sequences, which include the ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S rRNA. The result showed culturable yeast and filamentous fungi belonging to three classes: Ascomycota (Pyrenochaetopsis pratorum, Cladosporium herbarum, Thelebolus microsporus, Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium commune, and Venturia sp.), Basidiomycota (Mrakia blollopis and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa), and Zygomycota (Mucor flavus). Most of the fungal isolates appeared to be cold-tolerant, and about 60 % of the isolates showed keratinase activity. The reasonably low fungal diversity colonizing feathers indicates that the birds of Svalbard are casual carriers of fungi which may result in a negligible impact on their health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of fungal communities present on the feathers of birds in the high Arctic.

AB  - Arctic regions are experiencing the greatest rates of climate warming on the planet and marked changes have already been observed in terrestrial arctic ecosystems. While most studies have focused on the effects of warming on arctic vegetation and nutrient cycling, little is known about how belowground communities, such as fungi root-associated, respond to warming. Here, we investigate how long-term summer warming affects ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. We used Ion Torrent sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region to compare ECM fungal communities in plots with and without long-term experimental warming in both dry and moist tussock tundra. Cortinarius was the most OTU-rich genus in the moist tundra, while the most diverse genus in the dry tundra was Tomentella. On the diversity level, in the moist tundra we found significant differences in community composition, and a sharp decrease in the richness of ECM fungi due to warming. On the functional level, our results indicate that warming induces shifts in the extramatrical properties of the communities, where the species with medium-distance exploration type seem to be favored with potential implications for the mobilization of different nutrient pools in the soil. In the dry tundra, neither community richness nor community composition was significantly altered by warming, similar to what had been observed in ECM host plants. There was, however, a marginally significant increase in OTUs identified as ECM fungi with the medium-distance exploration type in the warmed plots. Linking our findings of decreasing richness with previous results of increasing ECM fungal biomass suggests that certain ECM species are favored by warming and may become more abundant, while many other species may go locally extinct due to direct or indirect effects of warming. Such compositional shifts in the community might affect nutrient cycling and soil organic C storage.

AB  - Two strains of a psychrophilic basidiomycetous yeast species belonging to the genus Mrakia were isolated from a melt-pool mat community, on an ice island located in Disraeli Fjord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. Analysis of the large subunit rDNA D1/D2 domain and internal transcribed spacer region sequences indicated that these strains represent a novel species, and the name Mrakia arctica sp. nov. is proposed. This new species could grow at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free media. Moreover, lipase and cellulase enzymes of M. arctica were strongly active even at -3 degrees C. These results suggest an important role for M. arctica in the biogeochemical cycle of glacial ecosystems. (C) 2017 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fungi are widely distributed on our planet, including in extremely harsh habitats, such as the polar regions. The extreme conditions of those habitats limit the number of organisms capable of living there, but some fungi are adapted to the polar conditions and play essential roles in nutrient cycling. However, knowledge about their diversity, distribution, and functioning is fragmented, and approaches used to study them are diverse, often yielding difficult-to-compare results. We present maps with locations of mycological studies in the Arctic and Antarctica, as well as a list of mycelial fungi found on various terrestrial substrates through cultivation on nutrient media and/or molecular methods. These fungi were identified to the species level based on morphological-cultural features or gene-sequence analysis. Analysis of the methods applied to study fungi in different substrates shows that a combination of multiple methods is optimal to study species composition. The taxonomic affiliation of the identified species to different fungal divisions is largely determined by habitat conditions and research methods. The largest number of species belongs to the divisions Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The predominant ecological groups were saprotrophic and symbiotic fungi. The majority of 1324 discovered fungal species are known as cosmopolitan species. Approximately one-fifth of the fungi were identical between the Arctic and Antarctica, only a few species are known to be endemic to Antarctica or Arctic, and there are 1-6 identified bipolar species. Claims of endemism of polar-region fungi are relatively weakly supported.

AB  - Fungi are widely distributed in all terrestrial ecosystems, and they are essential to the recycling of nutrients in all terrestrial habitats on earth. We wanted to determine the relationship between soil fungal communities and geochemical factors (geographical location and soil physicochemical properties) in three widely separated geographical regions (the Antarctic, Arctic, and Tibet Plateau). Using high-throughput Illumina amplicon sequencing, we characterized the fungal communities in 53 soil samples collected from the three regions. The fungal richness and diversity indices were not significantly different among the three regions. However, fungal community composition and many fungal taxa (Thelebolales,Verrucariales,Sordariales,Chaetothyriales,Hypocreales,Pleosporales,Capnodiales, andDothideales) significantly differed among three regions. Furthermore, geographical location (latitude and altitude) and six soil physicochemical properties (SiO42--Si, pH, NO3--N, organic nitrogen, NO2--N, and organic carbon) were significant geochemical factors those were correlated with the soil fungal community composition. These results suggest that many geochemical factors influence the distribution of the fungal species within the Antarctic, Arctic, and Tibet Plateau.

AB  - The basidiomycetous yeast, Glaciozyma antarctica, was isolated from various terrestrial materials collected from the Soya coast, East Antarctica, and formed frost-columnar colonies on agar plates frozen at -1 degrees C. Thawed colonies were highly viscous, indicating that the yeast produced a large number of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). G. antarctica was then cultured on frozen media containing red food coloring to observe the dynamics of solutes in unfrozen water; pigments accumulated in frozen yeast colonies, indicating that solutes were concentrated in unfrozen water of yeast colonies. Moreover, the yeast produced a small quantity of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) which inhibited ice crystal growth. Solutes in unfrozen water were considered to accumulate in the pore of frozen colonies. The extracellular IBPs may have held an unfrozen state of medium water after accumulation in the frost-columnar colony.

AB  - Given that changes in the patterns of vegetation and size of carbon (C) pools in the Arctic are likely to be profound by the end of this century, it is necessary to characterise the identity and ecological groupings, in terms of temperature response and C substrate utilisation, of saprotrophic (decomposer) fungi in organic matter in Arctic soils. Thus, the aims of this study were: (1) to identify the fungi isolated from standing-dead material of Schistidium apocarpum, as an example of a High Arctic moss, (2) to determine mycelial extension rates of these fungi at a range of temperatures (4, 10 and 25 degrees C), and (3) to characterise the functional potential, defined by C substrate utilisation at 6 degrees C, of fungal taxa.
   Fungi were isolated at 4 degrees C from standing-dead material of S. apocarpum from an area of polar semi-desert (79 degrees N), close to Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, in the High Arctic. From a collection of 662 isolates, 43 pure cultures were identified by DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing. Phoma sclerotioides, previously known as a temperate snow mould, was isolated most frequently. The ecology of fifteen fungal isolates was characterised in detail. In terms of temperature response, two groups were apparent, one of truly psychrophilic/psychrotrophic fungi and one of more mesophilic fungi which were generally less frequently isolated. In terms of carbon substrate utilisation in semi-defined solid media, most fungi could utilise a variety of carbon substrates (degradation of casein, cellulose and starch was widespread), except for tannic acid (degraded by only two of the five P. sclerotioides isolates and Scytalidium lignicola) and lignin and chitin (not decomposed by any isolate). The majority of isolates had been recorded previously from polar environments and/or as being able to survive at low temperatures.
   Fungi in tundra ecosystems, therefore, have significant potential to mineralise C at temperatures below 10 degrees C. A better understanding of the ecology of these fungi will allow us to improve predictions of C dynamics in arctic biomes in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Root and soil samples from 13 collecting sites located in the Canadian High Arctic were harvested between July 18 and 29, 1991, and surveyed for root colonization and spore populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Grasses of the genus Festuca (Festuca brachyphylla Schult. & Schult., Festuca baffinensis Polunin, and Festuca hyperborea Holmen ex Frederiksen) served as target plants. Of the 197 plant-root systems and soil rhizospheres examined, 28% were associated with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Roots of both F: brachyphylla and F: baffinensis were colonized, while none were detected in F. hyperborea root specimens. Five arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species were extracted from indigenous soils. The most frequent and abundant species was Glomus mosseae (Nicol. & Gerd.) Gerdemann & Trappe, which was isolated from 8 of the 13 sites sampled. Other Glomales species in Arctic soils were Glomus macrocarpum Tul & Tul., Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxter sensu Gerd.) Gerd. & Trappe emend. Walker & Koske, and two other unidentified Glomus species. Trap cultures of the indigenous soil with leek (Allium porrum L.) plants confirmed the identity of the species previously identified from original soil and allowed the detection of an additional species, Glomus aggregatum Schenck. & Smith. The novelty of these observations and the relationship between plant mycorrhizal status, fungal species, and soil disturbance are discussed.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the phosphate solubilization by filamentous fungi isolated from Antarctic lichen and sediment. The results yielded a total of 80 strains, 9 of which were positive for phosphate solubilization in solid NBRIP medium. Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 and Penicillium steckii 5Y.P4 showed the largest halos, indicating their potential in phosphate solubilization. Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 was the most efficient phosphorus (P) solubilizer with maximum P levels of 106.14 mg/L at 15 degrees C and 80.89 mg/L at 25 degrees C. This strain also showed solubilization activity at 0.5 M NaCl with P levels of 127.93 mg/L. At pH 8.0, the P content was 137.93 mg/L, and glucose was the best carbon source (P 146.55 mg/L). Moreover, the isolated fungus showed activity only with tricalcium phosphate as an inorganic phosphate source. During the solubilization process, Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 released formic, malic, and succinic acids by the 15th day of incubation (P 208.99 mg/L). These findings indicate that Cladosporium sp. 1EM.P1 from Antarctic sediment has the potential to solubilize phosphate and thus unveils new possibilities for the agricultural sector, aimed to reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers.

AB  - Arctic ecosystems are altered profoundly by climate changes. However, the responses of Arctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems as well as their biodiversity to global warming remain largely unknown. This article provides comprehensive insights into the results and major findings from the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) Project ? an Arctic region research program initiated in Japan, which aims to address and advance our understanding of these uncertainties. Marine ecosystem studies have identified several biogeochemical processes that are associated with sea ice decline and northward transport and shift of marine species across multiple trophic levels over the Bering and Chukchi Sea shelves. Studies of the terrestrial ecosystem have identified factors that are important for the understanding of terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems, including Arctic lakes, under the presence of global warming. Novel fungal species from the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem have also been isolated and described. Overall, these results could contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of the Arctic ecosystem services.

AB  - Urbanization in the Arctic results in considerable and still poorly known environmental consequences. The effect of urbanization on soil microbiome-an ecosystem component highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance-remains overlooked for the Arctic region. The research compared chemical and microbial properties of the natural Podzol soils and urban soils of Murmansk-the largest Arctic city. Particular attention was given to the profile distribution, which is almost completely ignored by most microbial studies. Soil microbiome was investigated by the quantitative indicators based on fluorescence microscopy (microbial biomass) and PCR real-time methods (amount of rRNA genes copies of archaea, bacteria, and fungi). The principal changes in urban soils' properties compared to the natural references included a shift in pH and an increase in C and nutrients' contents, especially remarkable for the subsoil. The numbers of rRNA genes copies of archaea, bacteria, and fungi in urban topsoils (10(6)-10(10), 10(9)-10(10), and 10(7)-10(9), respectively) were lower than in Podzol; however, the opposite pattern was shown for the subsoil. Similarly, the total microbial biomass in urban topsoils (0.55-0.75 mg g(-1)) was lower compared to the 1.02 mg g(-1) in Podzols, while urban subsoil microbial biomass was 2-2.5 times higher than in the natural conditions. Both for urban and natural soils and throughout the profiles, fungi were dominated by mycelium forms; however, the ratios of mycelium-spores were lower, and the amount of thin mycelium was higher in urban soils than in natural Podzols. Urbanization in the Arctic altered soil morphological and chemical properties and created a new niche for microbial development in urban subsoils; its contribution to biodiversity and nutrient cycling promises to become increasingly important under projected climate change.

AB  - The increasing amount of plastic waste causes significant environmental pollution. In this study, screening of Arctic microorganisms which are able to degrade bioplastics was performed. In total, 313 microorganisms were isolated from 52 soil samples from the Arctic region (Spitsbergen). Among the isolated microorganisms, 121 (38.66%) showed biodegradation activity. The ability of clear zone formation on emulsified poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) was observed for 116 microorganisms (95.87%), on poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) for 73 microorganisms (60.33%), and on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) for 102 microorganisms (84.3%). Moreover, the growth of microorganisms on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) agar plates was observed for 56 microorganisms (46.28%). Based on the 16S rRNA sequence, 10 bacterial strains which showed the highest ability for biodegradation were identified as species belonging to Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodococcus sp. The isolated fungal strains were tested for polycaprolactone films and commercial corn and potato starch bags degradation under laboratory conditions. Strains 16G (based on the analysis of a partial 18S rRNA sequence, identified as Clonostachys rosea) and 16H (identified as Trichoderma sp.) showed the highest capability for biodegradation. A particularly high capability for biodegradation was observed for the strain Clonostachys rosea, which showed 100% degradation of starch films and 52.91% degradation of PCL films in a 30-day shake flask experiment. The main advantage of the microorganisms isolated from Arctic environment is the ability to grow at low temperature and efficient biodegradation under this condition. The data suggest that C. rosea can be used in natural and laboratory conditions for degradations of bioplastics.

AB  - During a research cruise in 2016, we isolated fungi from sediments, seawater, driftwood, fruiting bodies, and macroalgae using three different media to assess species richness and potential bioactivity of cultivable marine fungi in the High Arctic region. Ten stations from the Svalbard archipelago (73-80 degrees N, 18-31 degrees E) were investigated and 33 fungal isolates were obtained. These grouped into 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) with acut-off set at 98% similarity. The taxonomic analysis showed that 17 OTUs belonged to Ascomycota, one to Basidiomycota, two to Mucoromycota and two were fungal-like organisms. The nuc rDNA V1-V5 regions of 18S (18S) and D1-D3 regions of 28S (28S) were sequenced from representative isolates of each OTU for comparison to GenBank sequences. Isolates of Lulworthiales and Eurotiales were the most abundant, with seven isolates each. Among the 22 OTUs, nine represent potentially undescribed species based on low similarity to GenBank sequences and 10 isolates showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria in an agar diffusion plug assay. These results show promise for the Arctic region as asource of novel marine fungi with the ability to produce bioactive secondary metabolites with antibacterial properties.

AB  - Microbial symbionts are essential for plant niche expansion into novel habitats. Dormant propagules of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are thought to play an important role in seedling establishment in invasion fronts; however, propagule bank communities above the treeline are poorly understood in the Eurasian Arctic, where treelines are expected to advance under rapid climate change. To investigate the availability of EM fungal propagules, we collected 100 soil samples from Arctic tundra sites and applied bioassay experiments using Larix cajanderi as bait seedlings. We detected 11 EM fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by obtaining entire ITS regions. Suillus clinto-nianus was the most frequently observed OTU, followed by Cenococcum geophilum and Sebacinales OTU1. Three Suillus and one Rhizo-pogon species were detected in the bioassay seedlings, indicating the availability of Larix-specific suilloid spores at least 30 km from the contemporary treeline. Spores of S. clintonianus and S. spectabilis remained infective after preservation for 14 mo and heat treatment at 60 ??C, implying the durability of the spores. Long-distance dispersal capability and spore resistance to adverse conditions may represent ecological strategies employed by suilloid fungi to quickly associate with emerging seedlings of compatible hosts in treeless habitats.

AB  - Extreme environments such as the Antarctic can lead to the discovery of new microbial taxa, as well as to new microbial-derived natural products. Considering that little is known yet about the diversity and the genetic resources present in these habitats, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the fungal communities from extreme environments collected at Aldmiralty Bay (Antarctica). A total of 891 and 226 isolates was obtained from soil and marine sediment samples, respectively. The most abundant isolates from soil samples were representatives of the genera Leucosporidium, Pseudogymnoascus, and a non-identified Ascomycota NIA6. Metschnikowia sp. was the most abundant taxon from marine samples, followed by isolates from the genera Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus. Many of the genera were exclusive in marine sediment or terrestrial samples. However, representatives of eight genera were found in both types of samples. Data from non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that each sampling site is unique in their physical-chemical composition and fungal community. Biotechnological potential in relation to enzymatic production at low/moderate temperatures was also investigated. Ligninolytic enzymes were produced by few isolates from root-associated soil. Among the fungi isolated from marine sediments, 16 yeasts and nine fungi showed lipase activity and three yeasts and six filamentous fungi protease activity. The present study permitted increasing our knowledge on the diversity of fungi that inhabit the Antarctic, finding genera that have never been reported in this environment before and discovering putative new species of fungi.

AB  - Arctic driftwood can provide unique insight into the diversity of colonizing and decaying fungi at the interface of extremely cold terrestrial and marine environments. Entering the Arctic Ocean via large boreal river systems and being transported by currents and sea ice, driftwood is finally deposited along shallow coastlines. Here, we sequence 177 fungal cultures in driftwood from Iceland, Greenland and the Siberian Lena Delta. Although some fungi may survive during ice drift, most species are not shared among the different sampling sites. Many indigenous Arctic fungi are generalists in their ability to colonize and decompose organic substrata, with massive effects on carbon cycling. Cadophora species are the most frequent Ascomycota, and soft rot is the most prevalent form of decay. Few Basidiomycota were found, with many of them having poor sequence matches to known species. Future research is warranted with a focus on the biology, ecology and taxonomy of Arctic driftwood inhabiting fungi. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence from recent Mars landers identified the presence of perchlorates salts at 1 wt % in regolith and their widespread distribution on the Martian surface that has been hypothesized as a critical chemical hazard for putative life forms. However, the hypersaline environment may also potentially preserve life and its biomolecules over geological timescales. The high concentration of natural perchlorates is scarcely reported on Earth. The presence of perchlorates in soil and ice has been recorded in some extreme environments including the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica, one of the best terrestrial analogues for Mars. In the frame of "Life in space" Italian astrobiology project, the polyextremophilic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus, a eukaryotic test organism isolated from the Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities, has been tested for its resistance, when grown on different hypersaline substrata. In addition, C. antarcticus was grown on Martian relevant perchlorate medium (0.4 wt% of Mg(ClO4)(2) and 0.6 wt% of Ca(ClO4)(2)) to investigate the possibility for the fungus to survive in Martian environment. Here, the results indicate a good survivability and metabolic activity recovery of the black fungus when grown on four Martian relevant perchlorates. A low percentage of damaged cellular membranes have been found, confirming the ultrastructural investigation.

AB  - The effect of hydrocarbon pollution on the fungal communities of littoral sediments of the cold-water White and Barents seas was investigated. The samples were collected at locations with different levels of pollution with oil products, from ports to relatively undisturbed areas. Using the diesel fuel-containing medium resulted in detection of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi in almost all studied samples, although in all cases they were less diverse than sugar-degrading fungi. In this relatively small group, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium brevicompactum were the most common organisms. Fungal communities isolated on a sugar-containing medium exhibited higher diversity and abundance, with being the most common sugar degraders. The major factors affecting the structure of the fungal communities were the percentage of hydrocarbons in the total mass of organic carbon in the samples in the case of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi and location, for sugar degraders. In the experiment, the highest hydrocarbon-degrading activity was shown for Penicillium chrysogenum (the loss of residual hydrocarbons was 77.4%), Cadophora fastigiata (72%), and Tolypocladium inflatum (67.2%).

AB  - Cryoconite holes have biogeochemical, ecological and biotechnological importance. This communication presents results on culturable psychrophilic yeast and filamentous fungi from cryoconite holes at Midre Lov,nbreen glacier. The identification of these microbes was achieved through conventional and DNA sequencing techniques. Effect of temperature, salt and media on growth of the cultures was studied. Measurements on the bioavailability of nutrients and trace metals were made through different methods including ICPMS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry). Colony forming unit (CFU) per gram of sediment sample was calculated to be about 7 x 10(3)-1.4 x 10(4) and 4 x 10(3)-1.2 x 10(4) of yeast and filamentous fungi, respectively. Based on morphology and sequence data, these were identified as Cryptococcus gilvescens, Mrakia sp., Rhodotorula sp., Phialophora alba and Articulospora tetracladia. Amongst these, Phialophora alba, Cryptococcus gilvescens and Mrakia sp. zhenx-1 are reported for the first time from Svalbard Arctic, while Rhodotorula sp. (95% gene similarity) is a new species, yet to be described. Rhodotorula sp. expressed high amylase, while Cryptococcus gilvescens showed high lipase activity. Mrakia sp. showed phosphate solubilization between 4 and 15A degrees C, which is a first record. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in substantial amounts in the sediments. Filamentous fungi and yeast in the cryoconite holes drive the process of organic macromolecule degradation through cold-adapted enzyme secretion, thereby assisting in nutrient cycling in these subglacial environments. Further, these cold-adapted enzymes may provide an opportunity for the prospect of biotechnology in Arctic. This is the first report on mycological investigation into cryoconite holes from Midre Lov,nbreen glacier.

AB  - We assessed the diversity and distribution of fungi in 13 water samples collected from four aquatic environments (stream, pond, melting ice water, and estuary) in the Ny-lesund Region, Svalbard (High Arctic) using 454 pyrosequencing with fungi-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene. Aquatic fungal communities in this region showed high diversity, with a total of 43,061 reads belonging to 641 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being found. Of these OTUs, 200 belonged to Ascomycota, 196 to Chytridiomycota, 120 to Basidiomycota, 13 to Glomeromycota, and 10 to early diverging fungal lineages (traditional Zygomycota), whereas 102 belonged to unknown fungi. The major orders were Helotiales, Eurotiales, and Pleosporales in Ascomycota; Chytridiales and Rhizophydiales in Chytridiomycota; and Leucosporidiales and Sporidiobolales in Basidiomycota. The common fungal genera Penicillium, Rhodotorula, Epicoccum, Glaciozyma, Holtermanniella, Betamyces, and Phoma were identified. Interestingly, the four aquatic environments in this region harbored different aquatic fungal communities. Salinity, conductivity, and temperature were important factors in determining the aquatic fungal diversity and community composition. The results suggest the presence of diverse fungal communities and a considerable number of potentially novel fungal species in Arctic aquatic environments, which can provide reliable data for studying the ecological and evolutionary responses of fungi to climate change in the Arctic ecosystem.

AB  - Aims To explore rhizospheric microbial communities from Arctic native plant species evaluating their bacterial hydrocarbon-degrading capacities. Methods and Results Eriophorum scheuchzeri, Potentilla cf. rubricaulis, Oxyria digyna, Salix arctica and Puccinellia angustata plant species were collected at Eureka (Canadian high Arctic) along with their rhizospheric soil samples. Their bacterial community fingerprints (16S rRNA gene, DGGE) were distinctive encompassing members from the phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Isolated diesel-degrading bacteria belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Strains of Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Intrasporangiaceae, Leifsoni and Arthrobacter possessed alkB and Pseudomonas possessed both ndoB and xylE gene sequences. Two Rhodococcus strains mineralized [1-14C] hexadecane at 5 and -5 degrees C. From the rhizosphere of P. angustata, larger numbers of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were isolated than from other plant rhizosphere samples and all three genes alkB (from Actinobacteria), ndoB and xylE (from Pseudomonas) were detected by PCR. Conclusions (i) Arctic plants have unique rhizospheric bacterial communities. (ii) P. angustata has potential for phytoremediation research at high Arctic soils. (iii) Isolated bacteria mineralized hydrocarbons at ambient low temperatures. Significance and Impact of the Study To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rhizospheric exploration examining the phytoremediation potential of five Arctic plants and evaluating their microbial hydrocarbon-degrading capacities.

AB  - In cold environments such as polar regions, microorganisms play important ecological roles, and most of our knowledge about them comes from studies of cultivable microorganisms. Metagenomic technologies are powerful tools that can give a more comprehensive assessment of microbial communities, and the amplification of rDNA followed by next-generation sequencing has given good results in studies aimed particularly at environmental microorganisms. Culture-independent studies of microbiota in terrestrial habitats of Antarctica, which is considered the driest, coldestclimate on Earth, are increasing and indicate that micro-diversity is much higher than previously thought. In this work, the microbial diversity of terrestrial habitats including eight islands of the South Shetland Archipelago, two islands on the Antarctic Peninsula and Union Glacier, was studied by amplicon-metagenome analysis. Molecular analysis of the studied localities clustered together the islands of the South Shetland Archipelago, except Greenwich Island, and separated them from the Litchfield and Lagotellerie islands and Union Glacier, which is in agreement with the latitudinal difference among them. Among fungi, 87 genera and 123 species were found, of which species belonging to 37 fungal genera not previously cultivated from Antarctica were detected. Phylogenetic analysis, including the closest BLAST-hit sequences, clustered fungi in 11 classes being the most represented Lecanoromycetes and Eurotiomycetes.

The growth responses to solar radiation of five fungi, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum, Pythium sp., Verticillium sp., and Mortierella parvispora, each isolated from Antarctic terrestrial habitats, were examined on an agar medium in the natural Antarctic environment. A 3-h exposure to solar radiation of >287 nm reduced the hyphal extension rates of all species relative to controls kept in the dark. Pythium sp. cultures exposed to solar radiation for 1.5 h on five consecutive days were most sensitive to radiation of >287 nm, but radiation of >313 nm also inhibited growth to a lesser extent. Radiation of >400 nm had no effect on hyphal growth relative to controls kept in the dark. Short-wave solar UV-B radiation of between 287 and 305 nm inhibited the growth of Pythium sp. hyphae on and below the surface of the agar medium after 24 h, but radiation of greater than or equal to345 nm only reduced the growth of surface hyphae. Similar detrimental effects of UV-B on surface and, to a lesser extent, submerged hyphae of all five fungi were shown in the laboratory by using artificial UV-B from fluorescent lamps. A comparison of growth responses to solar radiation and temperature showed that the species that were most resistant to UV radiation grew fastest at higher temperatures. These data suggest that solar UV-B reduces the growth of fungi on the soil surface in the Antarctic terrestrial environment.

AB  - Plant nitrogen (N) use is a key component of the N cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. The supply of N to plants affects community species composition and ecosystem processes such as photo-synthesis and carbon (C) accumulation. However, the availabilities and relative importance of different N forms to plants are not well understood. While nitrate (NO3-) is a major N form used by plants worldwide, it is discounted as a N source for Arctic tundra plants because of extremely low NO3- concentrations in Arctic tundra soils, undetectable soil nitrification, and plant-tissue NO3- that is typically below detection limits. Here we reexamine NO3- use by tundra plants using a sensitive denitrifier method to analyze plant-tissue NO3-. Soil-derived NO3- was detected in tundra plant tissues, and tundra plants took up soil NO3- at comparable rates to plants from relatively NO3--rich ecosystems in other biomes. Nitrate assimilation determined by N-15 enrichments of leaf NO3- relative to soil NO3- accounted for 4 to 52% (as estimated by a Bayesian isotope-mixing model) of species-specific total leaf N of Alaskan tundra plants. Our finding that in situ soil NO3- availability for tundra plants is high has important implications for Arctic ecosystems, not only in determining species compositions, but also in determining the loss of N from soils via leaching and denitrification. Plant N uptake and soil N losses can strongly influence C uptake and accumulation in tundra soils. Accordingly, this evidence of NO3- availability in tundra soils is crucial for predicting C storage in tundra.

AB  - This study assessed the fungal community composition and its relationships with properties of surface soils in the Ny-Alesund Region (Svalbard, High Arctic). A total of thirteen soil samples were collected and soil fungal community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing with fungi specific primers targeting the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The following eight soil properties were analyzed: pH, organic carbon (C), organic nitrogen (N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), silicate silicon (SiO42--Si), nitrite nitrogen (NO2- -N), phosphate phosphorus (PO43- -P), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N). A total of 57,952 reads belonging to 541 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found, of these OTUs, 343 belonged to Ascomycota, 100 to Basidiomycota, 31 to Chytridiomycota, 22 to Glomeromycota, 11 to Zygomycota, 10 to Rozellomycota, whereas 24 belonged to unknown fungi. The dominant orders were Helotiales, Verrucariales, Agaricales, Lecanorales, Chaetothyriales, Lecideales, and Capnodiales. The common genera (> eight soil samples) were Tetracladium, Mortierella, Fusarium, Cortinarius, and Atla. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-rda) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) revealed that soil pH (p = 0.001) was the most significant factor in determining the soil fungal community composition. Members of Verrucariales were found to predominate in soils of pH 8-9, whereas Sordariales predominated in soils of pH 7-8 and Coniochaetales predominated in soils of pH 6-7. The results suggest the presence and distribution of diverse soil fungal communities in the High Arctic, which can provide reliable data for studying the ecological responses of soil fungal communities to climate changes in the Arctic.

AB  - Arctic soils are constantly subjected to extreme environmental conditions such as low humidity, strong winds, high sa-linity, freeze-thaw cycles, UV exposition, and low nutrient availability, therefore, they have developed unique micro-bial ecosystems. These environments provide excellent opportunities to study microbial ecology and evolution within pristine (i.e. with limited anthropogenic influence) regions since the High Arctic is still considered one of the wildest and least explored environments on the planet. This environment is also of interest for the screening and recovery of unique microbial strains suitable for various biotechnological applications. In this study, a combination of culture -depended and culture-independent approaches was used to determine the cultivation bias in studies of the diversity of cold-active microorganisms. Cultivation bias is a reduction in recovered diversity, introduced when applying a clas-sical culturing technique. Six different soil types, collected in the vicinity of the Polish Polar Station Hornsund (Spits-bergen, Norway), were tested. It was revealed that the used media allowed recovery of only 6.37 % of bacterial and 20 % of fungal genera when compared with a culture-independent approach. Moreover, it was shown that a combina-tion of R2A and Marine Broth media recovered as much as 93.6 % of all cultivable bacterial genera detected in this study. Based on these results, a novel protocol for genome-guided bioprospecting, combining a culture-dependent ap-proach, metabarcoding, next-generation sequencing, and genomic data reuse was developed. With this methodology, 14 psychrotolerant, multi-metal-resistant strains, including the highly promising Rhodococcus spp., were obtained. These strains, besides increased metal tolerance, have a petroleum hydrocarbon utilization capacity, and thus may be good candidates for future bioremediation technologies, also suited to permanently cold regions.

AB  - Yeasts peculiar to the Dry Valleys of Antarctica can be recovered by allowing them to become enate (grow out) from soil particles. The enation system weas successful in liquid medium E-1 shaken at 160 rpm in a 10.degree. C water bath. Samples were spread on a richer medium, 2 MC. This system also allowed the isolation of typical soil yeasts from Colorado [USA] soils and of cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, filamentous fungi and chlorophyta. Marked inhibitory effects of conventional yeast media account for the failure of previous investigators to isolate these Antarctic yeasts. Their abundance remains unknown, since E-1 and 2 MC also have some inhibitory effects.

AB  - Aim Current evidence from temperate studies suggests that ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi require overland routes for migration because of their obligate symbiotic associations with woody plants. Despite their key roles in arctic ecosystems, the phylogenetic diversity and phylogeography of arctic ECM fungi remains little known. Here we assess the phylogenetic diversity of ECM communities in an isolated, formerly glaciated, high arctic archipelago, and provide explanations for their phylogeographic origins.
   Location Svalbard.
   Methods We generated and analysed internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences from both curated sporocarp collections (from Svalbard) and soil polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clone libraries (from Svalbard and the North American Arctic), compared these with publicly available sequences in GenBank, and estimated the phylogenetic diversity of ECM fungi in Svalbard. In addition, we conducted coalescent analyses to estimate migration rates in selected species.
   Results Despite Svalbard's geographic isolation and arctic climate, its ECM fungi are surprisingly diverse, with at least 72 non-singleton operational taxonomic units (soil) and 109 phylogroups (soil + sporocarp). The most species-rich genera are Thelephora/Tomentella, Cortinarius and Inocybe, followed by Hebeloma, Russula, Lactarius, Entoloma, Sebacina, Clavulina, Laccaria, Leccinum and Alnicola. Despite the scarcity of available reference data from other arctic regions, the majority of the phylogroups (73.4%) were also found outside Svalbard. At the same time, all putative Svalbard 'endemics' were newly sequenced taxa from diverse genera with massive undocumented diversity. Overall, our results support long-distance dispersal more strongly than vicariance and glacial survival. However, because of the high variation in nucleotide substitution rates among fungi, allopatric persistence since the Pliocene, although unlikely, cannot be statistically rejected. Results from the coalescent analyses suggest recent gene flow among different arctic areas.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate numerous recent colonization events and suggest that long-distance, transoceanic dispersal is widespread in arctic ECM fungi, which differs markedly from the currently prevailing view on the dispersal capabilities of ECM fungi. Our molecular evidence indicates that long-distance dispersal has probably played a major role in the phylogeographic history of some ECM fungi in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results may have implications for studies on the biodiversity, ecology and conservation of arctic fungi in general.

AB  - Although atmospheric counts of bacteria and fungi taken on Petri plates containing various bacteriological media were found to be lower than in temperate regions, data indicate that microorganisms capable of causing food spoilage are present in arctic air. Certain isolates were characterized to genus and species; it is suggested that they are of water and/or soil origin. Refrigeration is necessary in arctic regions, especially during the summer, as exemplified by a food poisoning outbreak occurring when proper precautions were not observed.

AB  - Soil micromorphology provides an excellent resource for investigating Palacoeskimo site-formation processes in the low arctic periglacial environment. In this study, micromorphology was used to answer questions concerning the composition, structure, origin and depositional agencies of the Tayara site active layer's sediments as well as to distinguish between natural (geogenic, biopedogenic) and cultural (anthropogenic) processes. Five groups of microfeatures were documented. These include 1) biopedological features (soil organic matter accumulation, mesofaunal and fungal activities), 2) transport-inherited features related to depositional processes (solifluction and stream sedimentation), 3) frost-induced microstructures and cryogenic features such as major post-depositional changes (ice-segregation, particle rearrangement. frost shattering. cryoturbation), 4) bone preservation in the active layer at the microscopic level, and 5) anthropogenic features related to Palaeoeskimo activities. The sediments from the three archaeological levels (1, [A and II) appear to have been very little influenced by anthropogenic factors. Cultural processes are micromorphologically observed in level II, with some evidence of feeding (bone presence), burning (wood charcoal, heated bone), and possibly trampling. However, the effects of natural processes on the sediments are more pronounced than anthropogenic ones. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We accessed the culturable mycobiota present in marine sediments at different depths in Antarctica Ocean. Acremonium fusidioides, Penicillium allii-sativi, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium palitans, Penicillium solitum, and Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus were identified. Penicillium allii-sativi was the dominant species. At least one isolate of each species was capable to present antifungal, trypanocidal, leishmanicidal, antimalarial, nematocidal, or herbicidal activities. Penicillium produced extracts with strong trypanocidal and antimalarial activities, and the extracts of P. solitum and P. chrysogenum demonstrated strong antimalarial activities. Acremonium fusidioides and P. verrucosus displayed strong selective herbicidal properties. The H-1 NMR signals for extracts of A. fusidioides, P. chrysogenum, and P. solitum indicated the presence of highly functionalized secondary metabolites, which may be responsible for the biological activities detected. In the deep marine Antarctic sediments, we detected fungal assemblages in which the Penicillium species were found to be dominant and demonstrated capabilities to survive and/or colonise that poly-extreme habitat. Penicillium being a polyextremophile Antarctic species, exhibited strong biological activities and the presence of aromatic compounds in its extracts may indicate that they are wild ancient strains with high genetic and biochemical potentials that enable them to produce bioactive compounds which can be researched in further studies and used in the chemotherapy of neglected tropical diseases as well as in agriculture.

Growth responses of Alternaria alternata, Chrysosporium pannorum, Nectria peziza, Thelebolus microsporus, Mycelia sterile and Phoma cf. herbarum to temperature. pH and culture media were investigated, Maximum growth occurred after 16 days, except in Nectria peziza and Thelebolus microsporus, where maximum growth occurred 12 days after inoculation. All isolates showed poor growth at 0 degrees C. Maximum growth was obtained with temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 degrees C. The optimum temperature for all fungi was 20 degrees C. An acid medium favoured growth. Chrysosporium pannorum. Phoma cf. herbarum and Nectria peziza grew best at pH 3-4, whereas Mycelia sterile, Alternaria alternata and Thelebolus microsporus grew best at pH 5-6. The culture medium had little effect on growth, except for nutrient agar, which showed poor growth against all isolates with the exception of Thelebolus microsporus.

AB  - Novel cultivation strategies for bacteria are widespread and well described for recovering greater diversity from the "hitherto" unculturable majority. While similar approaches have not yet been demonstrated for fungi it has been suggested that of the 1.5 million estimated species less than 5% have been recovered into pure culture. Fungi are known to be involved in many degradative processes, including the breakdown of petroleum hydrocarbons, and it has been speculated that in Polar Regions they contribute significantly to bioremediation of contaminated soils. Given the biotechnological potential of fungi there is a need to increase efforts for greater species recovery, particularly from extreme environments such as sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. In this study, like the yet-to-be cultured bacteria, high concentrations of nutrients selected for predominantly different fungal species to that recovered using a low nutrient media. By combining both media approaches to the cultivation of fungi from contaminated and non-contaminated soils, 91 fungal species were recovered, including 63 unidentified species. A preliminary biodegradation activity assay on a selection of isolates found that a high proportion of novel and described fungal species from a range of soil samples were capable of hydrocarbon degradation and should be characterized further.

AB  - Lichen symbiosis is a successful nutritional strategy that drives lichen distributions in high Arctic ecosystems. However, the in situ effects of fungal partners (mycobionts) on water availability for the photosynthetic partners (photobionts) and their necessity for survival remain unclear. We investigated the factors creating differences in water availability in high Arctic lichen assemblages using observational and experimental analyses of substrates and thallus morphology in the high Arctic, near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (79 degrees N) during the snow-free season. We used five lichen species found on five substrate types: moss litter, vascular plant litter, mixed litter, biological soil crust (BSC) and gravel. BSC had significantly higher water content than the other substrates; although it had high levels of surface evaporation, BSC took up more ground water. Moreover, the structure of BSC supported greater water retention than the four other substrates in our study, providing the moistest environment for lichens. In fact, 60 % of the surface area of the crustose lichen Ochrolechia frigida, which was mainly distributed on BSC, was in contact with the substrate. In contrast, the four fruticose lichens had larger surface areas than Och frig and roughly 90 % air exposure. Initial rates of absorption and evaporation increased with greater thallus surface area, suggesting that water availability for photobionts is strongly affected by both morphological characteristics and substrate water properties, both of which depend on mycobionts. We conclude that lichens show preferences for both morphologies and substrates that promote autotrophic nutrition in the water-limited glacier foreland of the high Arctic region.

Among these strains Penicillium cyclopium 1, the most effective for production of catalase, was selected by the method of test-tube microculture. The time course of growth and catalase production by this strain showed the intracellular activity of this enzyme to be about 3-fold higher than its extracellular level. Some properties of crude catalase preparation, isolated from postculture liquids by lyophilization, were also examined. Catalase activity showed its maximum at 15 degreesC, indicating adaptation of the enzyme to lower temperatures of the arctic environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Cryoconites are small cavities filled with water on the surface of glaciers in which microorganisms may develop during the thawing period. At the bottom of cryoconite holes, sediment accumulates, consisting of plant and animal debris and inorganic mineral particles. In this study, we provide the first report of fungal communities in cryoconite holes in the Werenskiold Glacier on Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, Arctic). Overall, we detected 21 species and 2 unassigned species, including micromycetes and macromycetes. Some of the fungi described may be harmful to humans or have biotechnological potential. Most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the occurrence of Aspergillus pseudoglaucus, Cladosporium allicinum, C. ramotenellum, Penicillium sumatraense, P. velutinum, Phanerochaete cumulodentata, Bjerkandera adusta, and Trametes versicolor in polar regions. Cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces are a source of cold-adapted microorganisms, but little is known about their fungal inhabitants. Here, we provide the first report of distinctive fungal communities in cryoconite holes in the Werenskiold Glacier on Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, Arctic). Due to a combination of two incubation temperatures (7 degrees C and 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and two media during isolation (PDA, YPG), as well as classical and molecular identification approaches, we were able to identify 23 different fungi (21 species and 2 unassigned species). Most of the fungi cultured from cryoconite sediment were ascomycetous filamentous micromycetes. However, four representatives of macromycetes were also identified (Bjerkandera adusta, Holwaya mucida, Orbiliaceae sp., and Trametes versicolor). Some of the described fungi possess biotechnological potential (Aspergillus pseudoglaucus, A. sydowii, Penicillium expansum, P. velutinum, B. adusta, and T. versicolor), thus, we propose the Arctic region as a source of new strains for industrial applications. In addition, two phytopathogenic representatives were present (P. sumatraense, Botrytis cinerea), as well as one potentially harmful to humans (Cladosporium cladosporioides). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the occurrence of A. pseudoglaucus, C. allicinum, C. ramotenellum, P. sumatraense, P. velutinum, P. cumulodentata, B. adusta, and T. versicolor in polar regions. In all likelihood, two unassigned fungus species (Orbiliaceae and Dothideomycetes spp.) might also be newly described in such environments. Additionally, due to experimenting with 10 sampling sites located at different latitudes, we were able to conclude that the number of fungal spores decreases as one moves down the glacier. Considering the prevalence and endangerment of glacial environments worldwide, such findings suggest their potential as reservoirs of fungal diversity, which should not be overlooked.

AB  - This study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from Antarctica and assess its potential antibacterial activity on Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, the agent of citrus canker. Metabolites production was conducted in Malt 2% broth at 15 degrees C for 20days after which intracellular and extracellular extracts were obtained. The extracts were evaluated by cell viability assays through Resazurin Microtitre Assay. From 158 fungal extracts, 33 hampered bacterial growth invitro. The average inhibition of the extracts obtained from terrestrial (soil) and marine (sediments) fungi was 94 and 97% respectively. These inhibition values were close to the average of 90% cell death for the positive control. MIC90 and MBC for the bioactive extracts were established. Isolates that produced active metabolites against the phytopathogen were identified using molecular taxonomy (ITS-rRNA sequencing) as: Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium, Cadophora, Paraconiothyrium and Toxicocladosporium. Antarctic fungal strains isolated from terrestrial and marine sediments were able to produce secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. citri subsp. citri, highlighting the importance of these microbial genetic resources. These metabolites have potential to be used as alternatives for the control of this plant pathogen.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis manuscript makes an impact on the study of micro-organisms from extreme habitats and their possible contribution in discovering new active molecules against pathogens of agricultural interest. Studies on the Antarctic continent and its communities have attracted the scientific community due to the long period of isolation and low levels of disturbance that surrounds the region. Knowing the potential of fungi in this region to produce active secondary metabolites, we aim to contribute to the discovery of compounds with antibacterial action in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, a plant pathogen present in several regions around the globe.

AB  - The study of the secondary metabolites of the relict strain Penicillium citrinum VKM FW-800 isolated from ancient Arctic permafrost sediments showed that this fungus produces agroclavine-1 and epoxyagroclavine-1, which are rare ergot alkaloids with the 5R, 10S configuration of the tetracyclic ergoline ring system. The production of the alkaloids by the fungus showed a biphasic behavior, being intense in the phase of active growth and slowing down in the adaptive lag phase and in the stationary growth phase. The addition of zinc ions to the incubation medium led to a fivefold increase in the yield of the alkaloids. The alkaloid-producing Penicillium fungi isolated from different regions exhibited the same tendencies of growth and alkaloid production.

AB  - Deception Island is a geothermal location in Antarctica that presents active fumaroles, which confers unique characteristics to this habitat. Several studies about microbial communities in Antarctica have been carried out, nevertheless, Antarctic microbiota is still partially unknown. Here we present a multidisciplinary study about sediments obtained by deposition during 4 years in which several approaches have been considered for their characterization. First, a physicochemical characterization, using ionic chromatography and mass spectrometry for the determination of most abundant ions (chloride and sulphate) and elements (mainly silicon), was conducted. In addition, the total microbial community was studied using a metataxonomical approach, revealing a bacterial community dominated by Proteobacteria and Thaumarchaeota as the main archaeal genera and a fungal community mainly composed by Aspergillaceae. Culture-dependent studies showed low microbial diversity, only achieving the isolation of Bacillus-related species, some of them thermophilic, and the isolation of common fungi of Aspergillus or Penicillium spp. Furthermore, diatoms were detected in the sediment and characterized attending to their morphological characteristics using scanning electron microscopy. The study reveals a high influence of the physicochemical conditions in the microbial populations and their distribution, offering valuable data on the interaction between the island and water microbiota.

AB  - The recovery of culturable microorganisms from ancient materials, ranging from a few thousand to several million years old, has generated interest in the long-term survival capabilities of micrororganisms. We report the occurrence of such paleobes for the first time from a deep-sea sediment core obtained from a depth of 5904 m from the Chagos trench in the Indian Ocean. Culturable fungi, direct counts of bacteria, age of the sediments based on the radiolarian assemblage, total organic carbon, Eh and CaCO3 were determined in these sediments. Culturable fungi were obtained from subsections up to 370 cm depth. The age of the sediments from which fungi were isolated was estimated to range from>0.18 to 0.43 million years (Ma), being the oldest recorded age for recovery of culturable fungi. Colony forming units of fungi ranged from 69 to 2493 g(-1) dry weight sediment with a maximum abundance recorded at 160 cm depth of the core, corresponding to similar to0.18 Ma. Bacterial numbers in the core showed oscillations corresponding to cycles of approximately 100 ka (kilo years). The fungi comprised non-sporulating forms and a sporulating form identified to be Aspergillus sydowii. Germination of spores of A. sydowii at 100, 300 and 500 bar hydrostatic pressures at 5 degreesC confirmed its barotolerance and its nativity to deep-sea sediments. We propose that deep-sea sediments are a source of paleobes, which could be useful in studies on palaeoclimate, long-term microbial survival and biotechnology. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fifty-six fungal isolates from Arctic soils were subjected to primary screening for their ability to solubilize insoluble inorganic phosphate. Nine of the isolates were further analysed quantitatively for phosphatase production using para-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate. Amongst these, a cold-tolerant fungus, Penicillium citrinum strain PG162 was found to be the best producer of intracellular acid phosphatase. Further characterization of the enzyme showed that it is most active in the temperature range of 40-60 degrees C and pH range of 4.2-4.8. The dried enzyme extract is stable at a temperature of up to 50 degrees C for at least 1 h. Its activity is affected by presence of metal ions. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis suggests the molecular weight of the enzyme to be between 20 and 29 kDa. The present study is important with respect to our understanding of the kind of enzymatic reactions that take place in the polar microbes, and the extent to which their activity is sustained.

AB  - Climate change may alter nutrient cycling in Arctic soils and plants. Deeper snow during winter, as well as summer warming, could increase soil temperatures and thereby the availability of otherwise limiting nutrients such as nitrogen (N). We used fences to manipulate snow depths in Svalbard for 9 consecutive years, resulting in three snow regimes: 1) Ambient with a maximum snow depth of 35 cm, 2) Medium with a maximum of 100 cm and 3) Deep with a maximum of 150 cm. We increased temperatures during one growing season using Open Top Chambers (OTCs), and sampled soil and vascular plant leaves throughout summer 2015. Labile soil N, especially inorganic N, during the growing season was significantly greater in Deep than Ambient suggesting N supply in excess of plant and microbial demand. However, we found no effect of Medium snow depth or short-term summer temperature increase on soil N, presumably due to minor impacts on soil temperature and moisture. The temporal patterns of labile soil N were similar in all snow regimes with high concentrations of organic N immediately after snowmelt, thereafter dropping towards peak growing season. Concentrations of all N forms increased at the end of summer. Vascular plants had high N at the start of growing season, decreasing as summer progressed, and leaf N concentrations were highest in Deep, corresponding to the higher soil N availability. Short-term summer warming was associated with lower leaf N concentrations, presumably due to growth dilution. Deeper snow enhanced labile soil organic and inorganic N pools and plant N uptake. Leaf N-15 natural abundance levels (delta N-15) in Deep indicated a higher degree of utilization of inorganic than organic N, which was especially pronounced in mycorrhizal plants.

AB  - Mosses are a dominant component of high-arctic terrestrial ecosystems, yet little is known regarding the abundance and diversity of fungi associated with these abundant plants. We investigated vertical patterns of abundance and diversity of fungi and their relationship with chemical properties within profiles of Hylocomium splendens and Racomitrium lanuginosum collected in the Oobloyah Bay area on Ellesmere Island, Canada. The moss profiles were divided into 6 (H. splendens) and 5 (R. lanuginosum) layers according to the color and texture, and hyphal length, fungal assemblages, and contents of organic chemical components (acid-unhydrolyzable residues, total carbohydrates, extractives) and nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) were measured. Total hyphal length was greatest at the middle layers of H. splendens and at the deepest layers of R. lanuginosum and was significantly affected by moss species and nutrient contents. A total of 18 and 19 fungal taxa was isolated from the profiles of H. splendens and R. lanuginosum, respectively, with 11 taxa being common to both moss species. Moss species significantly affected the species distribution of fungi. Individual fungal taxa showed patterns of vertical distribution within the moss profiles. The contents of acid-unhydrolyzable residues and nutrients increased and the content of total carbohydrates decreased down the profile, which was attributable to the ability of fungi to decompose carbohydrates selectively and to immobilize nutrients in decomposed moss residues.

AB  - Endolichenic fungi within 17 lichen species in the area near Ny-lesund (Svalbard, High Arctic) were studied by a culture-based method. The 247 fungal isolates were obtained from 2712 lichen thallus segments. The colonization rate of endolichenic fungi ranged from 1.6 to 26.5 %, respectively. These isolates were identified to 40 fungal taxa, including 35 Ascomycota (10 orders), 4 Basidiomycota (3 orders), and 1 unidentified fungus. Thelebolales was the most abundant order, while Sordariales were the most diverse order. The common fungal taxa shared by more than 3 lichen species were Thelebolus microsporus (93 isolates), Coniochaeta hoffmannii (7 isolates), Sarocladium kiliense (33 isolates), Coniochaeta sp. 1 (5 isolates), Coniochaeta sp. 4 (28 isolates), and Coniochaeta sp. 2 (5 isolates). Low Sorenson's similarity coefficients were observed among different lichen species, indicating that host-related factor may shape the endolichenic fungal communities in this region. In addition, no endolichenic fungal taxa were previously found in the Antarctica and Austrian Alps, suggesting endolichenic fungal communities in this region might be also shaped by the Arctic climate. The results demonstrate the existence of specific cultured endolichenic fungal species, which may be suitable objects for further study of their possible functional roles in the lichen thalli.

AB  - Soil microbes play important roles in global carbon and nutrient cycling. Soil microfungi are generally amongst the most important contributors. They produce various extracellular hydrolase enzymes that break down the complex organic molecules in the soil into simpler form. In this study, we investigated patterns of amylase and cellulase (which are responsible for breaking down starch and cellulose, respectively) relative activity (RA) on solid media at different culture temperatures in fungal strains from Arctic, Antarctic and tropical soils. Fungal isolates from all three regions were inoculated onto R2A media supplemented with starch for amylase and carboxymethylcellulose and trypan blue for cellulase screening. The isolates were then incubated at 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 A degrees C and examined for activity after 5 and 10 days, for tropical and polar isolates, respectively. The data obtained indicate that the polar fungal strains exhibited similar patterns of amylase and cellulase RA. Both Arctic and Antarctic fungi showed highest RA for amylase and cellulase at 35 A degrees C, while colony growth was maximised at 15 A degrees C. Colony growth and RA of the polar isolates were negatively correlated suggesting that, as temperatures increase, the cells become stressed and have fewer resources available to invest in growth. Unlike polar isolates, tropical isolates did not exhibit any trend of colony growth with temperature, rather having idiosyncratic patterns in each isolate. The low enzyme production and RA levels in the tropical strains may suggest both a low ability to respond to temperature variation in their natural thermally stable tropical habitats, as well as a level of thermal stress limiting their enzyme production ability.

AB  - 2,000 microbial strains were isolated from soil samples and tested to determine their lipolytic activity by employing screening techniques on solid and in liquid media. Culture broths were initially tested with 1,2-O-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid-resorufinyl ester, a chromogenic substrate specific for lipases. Fourteen lipase-producing microorganisms were selected and their taxonomic identification was carried out. Hydrolysis of tributyrin or olive oil and the esterification of oleic acid with heptanol were selected to preliminary evaluate the catalytic activity of these lipases. All the selected lipases catalysed this esterification reaction with good yields. Resolution of (R,S)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid, (R,S)-1-phenylethanol, (R,S) 1-phenylethylamine and of (R) or (S) glycidol were performed to evaluate the stereoselectivity of these novel enzymes as biocatalysts in reactions in organic media. Lipases from the fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Ovadendron sulphureo-ochraceum gave the best yields and enantioselectivities in the resolution of racemic ibuprofen and 1-phenylethanol, Several lipases displayed a high stereoselectivity in the resolution of chiral amines by an alcoxycarbonylation reaction.

AB  - In the present study, a fungal strain isolated from the Antarctic soil was identified as Penicillium sp. CHY-2 based on its 5.8S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Furthermore, its biodegradation ability towards 13 different toxic compounds such as 4-butylphenol (4-BP), 4-sec-butylphenol (4-s-BP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), 4-tertoctylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), phenol, bisphenol A (BPA), benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene at low (4 degrees C) and medium (15 degrees C) temperature conditions was evaluated using high pressure liquid chromatography. Among the 13 compounds, the strain CHY-2 effectively degraded the six compounds i.e., 4-BP, 4-s-BP, 4-t-BP, 4-NP, 4-CP, and phenol at 15 degrees C within one week, and at 4 degrees C within 3weeks. Also CHY-2 effectively degraded the 4-t-OP at 15 degrees C (70%), but not at 4 degrees C (35%). Among different carbon sources tested, glucose was found to be the most suitable and the growth of CHY-2 at 4 degrees C was slower than at 15 degrees C. Addition of Tween 80 increased the growth and degradation ability of CHY-2 towards 4-BP at 4 and 15 degrees C. The metabolites produced during the degradation of 4-BP were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Also, bacteria present in the Antarctic soil were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the result showed the presence of Pseudomonas and Syntrophus groups of bacteria.

AB  - In the Arctic, fungal mycelial growth takes place mainly during the cold season and beginning of growing season. Climate change induced increases of cold season temperatures may, hence, benefit fungal growth and increase their abundance. This is of particular importance for parasitic fungi, which may significantly shape Arctic vegetation composition. Here, we studied two contrasting plant parasitic fungi's occurrences (biotrophic Exobasidium hypogenum Nannf. on the vascular plant Cassiope tetragona (L.) D. Don., and necrotrophic Pythium polare Tojo, van West & Hoshino on the moss Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) Loeske) in response to increased snow depth, a method primarily used to increase cold season temperatures, after 7- 13 years of snow manipulation in Adventdalen, Svalbard. We show that enhanced snow depth increased occurrences of both fungi tested here and indicate that increased fungal infections of host plants were at least partly responsible for decreases of host occurrences. Although bryophyte growth, in general, may be influenced by increased soil moisture and reduced competition from vascular plants, Pythium polare is likely enhanced by the combination of milder winter temperatures and moister environment provided by the snow. The relationships between host plants and fungal infection indicate ongoing processes involved in the dynamics of compositional adjustment to changing climate.

AB  - Fungal community associated with terrestrial Arctic moss, Tetraplodon mimoides was studied by examining fresh thallus tissue and adhered soil. The study resulted in the isolation of 46 microfungi belonging to 20 species in 12 genera. These included seven non-sporulating morphotypes. To the best of our knowledge, species such as Botrytis verrucosa, Mortierella simplex, M. schmuckeri, Penicillium frequentans, P. rugulosum and Cladosporium chlorocephalum are new records to the study region. All isolates were tested for production of cold-adapted amylase, pectinase, cellulase, esterase, protease, phosphatase and urease. The cultures showed varying degrees of enzyme production, with two cultures producing all seven enzymes. The present study helps in understanding the fungal diversity associated with plants growing in extreme habitats.

AB  - Knowledge of the occurrence, distribution and diversity of pathogens of insects and arachnids (entomopathogens) in the Arctic is very limited. Climate change is expected to affect Arctic terrestrial arthropod communities and therefore also host-pathogen interactions, given that entomopathogens are present. We conducted a survey of fungal entomopathogens in soil samples collected at four localities in Greenland; two at low Arctic sites (Ritenbenk and Disko Island) and two at sites in the high Arctic (Zackenberg and Danmarkshavn). Fungi were isolated from soil samples using larvae of the insect species Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera) and Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera) as baits providing evidence that the fungal isolates were indeed entomopathogenic. Five fungal species (Ascomycota; Hypocreales) were found: Isaria fumosorosea Wize, Isaria farinosa (Holmsk.) Fr., Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill., Beauveria pseudobassiana Rehner and Humber and Tolypocladium inflatum W. Gams (syn. = T. niveum). I. farinosa was found at all four localities, while I. fumosorosea was detected in single samples at each of three localities including both high Arctic sites. Only the locality on Disko Island revealed B. bassiana, whereas B. pseudobassiana was isolated at the three other sites. T. inflatum was only found on Disko Island and only isolated with T. molitor as a bait insect. The results document that fungal entomopathogens are widely distributed in the soil environment in Greenland. Entomopathogens should therefore be included in future studies of arthropod ecology in the Arctic.

AB  - The Antarctic and Arctic regions are collectively referred to as the "Two Poles" of the earth and have extremely harsh climate conditions and fragile ecosystems. Until now, the biogeography of the fungal communities in the bipolar regions is not well known. In this study, we focused on the fungal communities in 110 samples collected from four habitat types (i.e., soil, vascular plant, freshwater, moss) in the Antarctic and Arctic sites using high-throughput sequencing. The data showed that the diversity and composition of fungal communities were both geographically patterned and habitat-patterned. ANOSIM tests revealed statistically significant differences among fungal communities in the eight sample types (R = 0.5035, p < 0.001) and those in the bipolar regions (R = 0.32859, p < 0.001). Only 396 OTUs (14.8%) were shared between the bipolar sites. Fungal communities in the four habitat types clustered together in the Arctic site but were separate from those of the Antarctic site, indicating that geographic distance was a more important determinant of fungal communities in the bipolar sites. These findings offer insights into the present-day biogeography of fungal communities in the bipolar sites.

AB  - Eutypenoids A-C (1-3), pimarane diterpenoid alkaloid and two ring A rearranged pimarane diterpenoids, were isolated from the culture of Eutypella sp. D-1 obtained from high-latitude soil of the Arctic. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were authenticated on the basis of the mass spectroscopy (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) analysis. The immunosuppressive effects of eutypenoids A-C (1-3) were studied using a ConA-induced splenocyte proliferation model, which suggested that 2 exhibited potent immunosuppressive activities.

AB  - Soil filamentous fungi from Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen, were studied. A total of 30 fungal isolates were identified by morpho-taxonomy, and the identity of some morpho-taxonomically complex isolates was authenticated by ITS1-5.8S and ITS2 rDNA domain sequence similarity. The isolates belonged to 19 species under 14 genera (Acremonium, Arthrinium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Corynespora, Emericella, Geomyces, Mortierella, Mucor, Myrothecium, Penicillium, Phialophora, Preussia, Xylaria). To the best of our knowledge, Acremonium roseolum, Aspergillus aculeatus, Emericella nidulans, and Preussia sp. are the first northernmost records from Arctic soils. The viable fungal count in different soil samples varied from 0.5 x 10(4) to 2.0 x 10(5) g(-1). Species richness in different soil samples was also calculated. Mortierella was one of the most dominant genera in Arctic soils. A temperature tolerance study was carried out for all the isolates, and representative species were screened for their extracellular enzyme activity (amylase, cellulase, phosphatase, and pectinase) at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Among the 30 isolates, seven showed cellulolytic activity, two were phosphate solubilizers, three had amylolytic activity, and only one showed pectinolytic activity on solid media. CMCase (beta 1, 4-endoglucanase) activity was quantified in seven isolates that exhibited positive activity during preliminary screening. The records of enzyme activity for amylases, pectinases, and cellulases are the first from the fungi of Spitsbergen. The present study indicates the dominance in Ny-Alesund of cellulolytic strains, which may serve as potent decomposers in Arctic tundra. These isolates may be used to facilitate the mineralization of cellulolytic wastes generated by human activities in colder hilly areas across the world, including the Himalayas in India.

AB  - Fungi have been only rarely isolated from glacial ice in extremely cold polar regions and were in these cases considered as random, long-term preserved Aeolian deposits. Fungal presence has so far not been investigated in polar subglacial ice, a recently discovered extreme habitat reported to be inhabited exclusively by heterotrophic bacteria. In this study we report on the very high occurrence (up to 9000 CFU L-1) and diversity of filamentous Penicillium spp. in the sediment-rich subglacial ice of three different polythermal Arctic glaciers (Svalbard, Norway). The dominant species was P. crustosum, representing on the average half of all isolated strains from all three glaciers. The other most frequently isolated species were P. bialowiezense, P. chrysogenum, P. thomii, P. solitum, P. palitans, P. echinulatum, P. polonicum, P. commune, P. discolor, P. expansum, and new Penicillium species (sp. 1). Twelve more Penicillium species were occasionally isolated. The fungi isolated produced consistent profiles of secondary metabolites, not different from the same Penicillium species from other habitats. This is the first report on the presence of large populations of Penicillium spp. in subglacial sediment-rich ice.

AB  - Antarctica's extreme environment and geographical isolation offers a useful platform for testing the relative roles of environmental selection and dispersal barriers influencing fungal communities. The former process should lead to convergence in community composition with other cold environments, such as those in the Arctic. Alternatively, dispersal limitations should minimise similarity between Antarctica and distant northern landmasses. Using high-throughput sequencing, we show that Antarctica shares significantly more fungi with the Arctic, and more fungi display a bipolar distribution, than would be expected in the absence of environmental filtering. In contrast to temperate and tropical regions, there is relatively little endemism, and a strongly bimodal distribution of range sizes. Increasing southerly latitude is associated with lower endemism and communities increasingly dominated by fungi with widespread ranges. These results suggest that microorganisms with well-developed dispersal capabilities can inhabit opposite poles of the Earth, and dominate extreme environments over specialised local species.

AB  - A unicellular, heterotrophic, eukaryotic parasite was isolated from nearshore Arctic marine sediment in association with the diatom Pleurosigma sp. The parasite possessed ectoplasmic threads that could penetrate diatom frustules. Healthy and reproducing Pleurosigma cultures would begin to collapse within a week following the introduction of this parasite. The parasite (2-10 mu m diameter) could reproduce epibiotically with biflagellate zoospores, as well as binary division inside and outside the diatom host. While the parasite grew, diatom intracellular content disappeared. Evaluation of electron micrographs from co-cultures revealed the presence of hollow tubular processes and amorphic cells that could transcend the diatom frustule, generally at the girdle band, as well as typical thraustochytrid ultrastructure, such as the presence of bothrosomes. After nucleotide extraction, amplification, and cloning, database queries of DNA revealed closest molecular affinity to environmental thraustochytrid clone sequences. Testing of phylogenetic hypotheses consistently grouped this unknown parasite within the Thraustochytriidae on a distinct branch within the environmental sequence clade Lab19. Reclassification of Arctic high-throughput sequencing data, with appended reference datasets that included this diatom parasite, indicated that the majority of thraustochytrid sequences, previously binned as unclassifiable stramenopiles, are allied to this new isolate. Based on the combined information acquired from electron microscopy, life history, and phylogenetic testing, this unknown isolate is described as a novel species and genus.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the taxonomic identity of yeasts isolated from the Antarctic continent and to evaluate their ability to produce enzymes (lipase, protease and xylanase) at low and moderate temperatures. A total of 97 yeast strains were recovered from marine and terrestrial samples collected in the Antarctica. The highest amount of yeast strains was obtained from marine sediments, followed by lichens, ornithogenic soils, sea stars, Salpa sp., algae, sea urchin, sea squirt, stone with lichens, Nacella concinna, sea sponge, sea isopod and sea snail. Data from polyphasic taxonomy revealed the presence of 21 yeast species, distributed in the phylum Ascomycota (n = 8) and Basidiomycota (n = 13). Representatives of encapsulated yeasts, belonging to genera Rhodotorula and Cryptococcus were recovered from 7 different Antarctic samples. Moreover, Candida glaebosa, Cryptococcus victoriae, Meyerozyma (Pichia) guilliermondii, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and R. laryngis were the most abundant yeast species recovered. This is the first report of the occurrence of some species of yeasts recovered from Antarctic marine invertebrates. Additionally, results from enzymes production at low/moderate temperatures revealed that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse cultivable yeasts, which could be considered as a target for biotechnological applications. Among the evaluated yeasts in the present study 46.39, 37.11 and 14.43 % were able to produce lipase (at 15 A degrees C), xylanase (at 15 A degrees C) and protease (at 25 A degrees C), respectively. The majority of lipolytic, proteolytic and xylanolytic strains were distributed in the phylum Basidiomycota and were mainly recovered from sea stars, lichens, sea urchin and marine sediments.

AB  - In a high Arctic polar semidesert ecosystem (ambient N deposition c. 0.1 g N m(-2) a(-1)), the effects of N enrichment on the diversity of soil microfungi and on N content and availability in organic and mineral soils were determined. Three N (total: 0, 0.5, 5 g N m(-2) a(-1)) and two P (total 0, 1 g m(-2) a(-1)) treatments were applied, since P may limit response to N in this ecosystem. Organic and mineral soils were sampled in June and August in the second year of treatment for microfungi, pH, moisture content, and total N and P. In the third year, soils were resampled for extractable and total N and P. The fungi isolated were typical of high pH soils in the High Arctic and Antarctic. The species richness and diversity of soil microfungi were very low, with ranges as follows: Shannon diversity, 0.56-1.5; richness, 2-6; evenness, 0.79-0.9. There was no significant effect of treatment on the frequency of occurrence of different taxa of soil microfungi. Time of sampling also had no significant impact on fungal assemblages, although different, more diverse communities were isolated from organic, rather than mineral, soils. Nitrate-N in organic soil decreased significantly when P was added alone, but not when P and N were added together. Addition of 0.5 g N m(-2) a(-1), a rate deposition already occurring in Greenland and Iceland, appeared to exceed N demand even when P limitation was relieved. There was no apparent soil acidification as a result of the N treatments.

AB  - Recent molecular evidence suggests a global distribution of marine fungi; however, the ecological relevance and corresponding biological contributions of fungi to marine ecosystems remains largely unknown. We assessed fungal biomass from the open Arctic Ocean by applying novel biomass conversion factors from cultured isolates to environmental sterol and CARD-FISH data. We found an average of 16.54 nmol m(-3) of ergosterol in sea ice and seawater, which corresponds to 1.74 mg C m(-3) (444.56 mg C m(-2) in seawater). Using Chytridiomycota-specific probes, we observed free-living and particulate-attached cells that averaged 34.07 mu g C m(-3) in sea ice and seawater (11.66 mg C m(-2) in seawater). Summed CARD-FISH and ergosterol values approximate 1.77 mg C m(-3) in sea ice and seawater (456.23 mg C m(-2) in seawater), which is similar to biomass estimates of other marine taxa generally considered integral to marine food webs and ecosystem processes. Using the GeoChip microarray, we detected evidence for fungal viruses within the Partitiviridae in sediment, as well as fungal genes involved in the degradation of biomass and the assimilation of nitrate. To bridge our observations of fungi on particulate and the detection of degradative genes, we germinated fungal conidia in zooplankton fecal pellets and germinated fungal conidia after 8 months incubation in sterile seawater. Ultimately, these data suggest that fungi could be as important in oceanic ecosystems as they are in freshwater environments.

AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans.
   Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria. (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.
   Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.

AB  - The study of chronosequences is an effective tool to study the effects of environmental changes or disturbances on microbial community structures, diversity, and the functional properties of ecosystems. Here, we conduct a chronosequence study on the Ardley Island coastal terrace of the Fildes Peninsula, Maritime Antarctica. The results revealed that prokaryotic microorganism communities changed orderly among the six successional stages. Some marine microbial groups could still be found in near-coastal soils of the late stage (lowest stratum). Animal pathogenic bacteria and stress-resistant microorganisms occurred at the greatest level with the longest succession period. The main driving factors for the succession of bacteria, archaea, and fungi along Ardley Island terrace were found through Adonis analysis (PERMANOVA). During analysis, soil elements Mg, Si, and Na were related to the bacterial and archaeal community structure discrepancies, while Al, Ti, K, and Cl were related to the fungal community structure discrepancies. On the other hand, other environmental factors also play an important role in the succession of microbial communities, which could be different among each microorganism. The succession of bacterial communities is greatly affected by pH and water content; archaeal communities are greatly affected by NH4+; fungal communities are affected by nutrients such as NO3-. In the analysis of the characteristic microorganisms along terrace, the succession of microorganisms was found to be influenced by complex and comprehensive factors. For instance, environmental instability, relationship with plants and ecological niches, and environmental tolerance. The results found that budding reproduction and/or with filamentous appendages bacteria were enriched in the late stage, which might be connected to its tolerance to rapid changes and barren environments. In addition, the decline in ammonia oxidation capacity of Thaumarchaeota archaeade with succession and the evolution of the fungi-plant relationship throughout classes were revealed. Overall, this research improves the understanding of the effect of the marine-to-terrestrial transition of the Ardley Island terrace on microbial communities. These findings will lay the foundation for more in-depth research regarding microbial adaptations and evolutionary mechanisms throughout the marine-terrestrial transition in the future.

AB  - Polar willow (Salix polaris Wahlenb.), a mycorrhizal dwarf shrub, colonizes recently deglaciated areas in the High Arctic, Svalbard. To clarify successional changes in ECM fungi associated with S. polaris after glacier retreat, we examined the diversity and density of ECM fungi in culture and field conditions. Plant and soil samples were collected from three sites of different successional stages in the deglaciated area of Austre Broggerbreen, near Ny-lesund, Svalbard. The successional stages were early stage with newly exposed bare ground (site I), transient stage with scattered colonization of Salix (sites IIa and IIb), and late stage with well-developed vegetation (site III). No ECM colonization on Salix was observed in soils collected from bare ground in early and transient stages (sites I and IIa). However, most Salix individuals showed ECM colonization in soils collected from sites close to Salix colonies in transient and late stages (sites IIb and III). Based on molecular analyses and operational taxonomic unit (OTU: > 95% ITS sequence similarity) delimitations, we identified 15 OTUs/species in eight genera. The dominant OTU/species of ECM fungi identified in the transient and late stages was Geopora sp.1 and Cenococcum sp.1, respectively. In the culture experiment, ECM diversity was greater in late stage (eight OTUs/species) than in transient stage (three OTUs/species). This pattern was consistent with field observations, i.e., late-stage sites contained more OTUs/species of ECM fungi. These results indicate that species diversity of ECM fungi increases and the dominant species changes with the progress of succession after glacier retreat in the High Arctic.

AB  - Cold active extracellular hydrolytic enzymes produced by different groups of bacteria are a valuable source for biotechnological applications and for gathering knowledge about the eco-physiological role of these microbes in their habitat. Ny-angstrom lesund of Arctic region is one of the northernmost polar area of our world. In order to understand the geo-microbiological features of this unexplored habitat, a total of 51 heterotrophic bacterial isolates were isolated from Ny-angstrom lesund soil sample. More than 74% (38 isolates) of the isolates showed significant extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity, such as amylase, protease, lipase, DNase, phosphatase etc. Combined hydrolytic degradation have been detected in a number of isolates. The best producers were identified on the basis of 16s rRNA gene Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic distribution of the identified strains shows high presence (71%) of gamma-Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas sp.; Acinetobacter sp.) in the sample. Two other genera Paenibacillus and Planococcus were also identified.

AB  - Eleven Fusarium species were isolated from 22 of 37 soil samples collected from 37 sites in Norway from grassy areas; 33 samples were near the Arctic Circle (61-68.degree. N). Fusarium oxysporum was abundant at 17 sites; F. merismoides at six sites; F. moniliforme at five sites; and F. acuminatum, F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. equiseti, F. proliferatum, F. sambucinum, F. semitectum, and F. solani were identified at 1-4 sites. Fusarium merismoides was found only in the most northern latitudes (65.degree.50''-68.degree.18''N). Three of the four isolates of F. moniliforme and 36 of 37 isolates of F. oxysporum tested for toxigenicity caused weight losses, hematuria and hemorrhage of tissues, and death of rats when rats were fed a rice medium in which Fusarium species were cultured Fusarium merismoides was not lethal but caused substantial weight losses to rats in the 5-day test period.

AB  - We assessed culturable soil microfungal diversity in various habitats around Hornsund, Spitsbergen in the High Arctic, using potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. Thermal growth classification of the fungi obtained was determined by incubating them in 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C, permitting separation of those with psychrophilic, psychrotolerant and mesophilic characteristics. In total, 68 fungal isolates were obtained from 12 soil samples, and grouped into 38 mycelial morphotypes. Intergenic spacer regions of these morphotypes were sequenced, and they represented 25 distinct taxonomic units, of which 21 showed sufficient similarity with available sequence data in NCBI to be identified to species level. Soil under ornithogenic influence showed the highest species diversity, including sequences assigned to Mortierella macrocystis, M. elongata, Mortierella sp., Cudoniella sp., Varicosporium elodeae, Beauveria bassiana, Geomyces pannorum, Penicillium sp. and Atradidymella muscivora. Fourteen taxa were classified as psychrophilic, seven mesophilic, and four psychrotolerant.

AB  - Scarce research into the secondary metabolites of the fungi Pseudogymnoascus spp. has shown a hidden biosynthetic potential for biologically active compounds. This work investigated the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by two Pseudogymnoascus fungal strains, VKM F-4518 and VKM F-4519, isolated from the surface soil layer of the Kolyma Lowland, Russia, in the Arctic. In these strains, 16-membered trilactone macrolides, (+)-macrosphelides A and B, were identified using 1D and 2D NMR, UHRMS, and optical rotation data. In the fungi of this genus, these metabolites were found for the first time. The studied strains are highly active producers of macrosphelide A, which is being considered as a promising agent for the cure of cancer. Using the antiSMASH secondary metabolite analysis tool, we found that the genome of strain VKM F-4518 contained 32 of the biosynthetic clusters of the secondary metabolite genes (BGC) and that of VKM F-4519 had 17 BGCs. Based on the comparison of the cluster of macrotriolide genes from the fungus Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa, we found the complete supposed cluster BGCs of macrosphelides in the genomes of two Pseudogymnoascus strains using the BLAST+ program.

AB  - Microfungi isolated from soil samples collected in Franz Joseph Land by means of the soil dilution and soil washing methods were screened for their ability to grow at low temperatures. The oligotrophic ability of the psychrotrophic strains was then determined on silica gel. A total of 40 taxa from 21 genera were isolated. Most isolates were species of Acremonium, Geomyces, Mortierella, Phialophora, Phoma, Thelebolus and sterile fungi. Eutypella scoparia, Hyphozyma variabilis and Ovadendron sulphureo-ochraceum are new records as soil and Arctic fungi. Most fungal isolates were psychrotrophic. The few psychrooligotrophs were species of Geomyces, Phoma, Thelebolus and Mortierella. Overall, our results suggest that the major component of an Arctic soil mycoflora should be active in one or more short growing seasons interspersed with periods of prolonged dormancy. Only a minor component, such as the small group of psychrooligotrophic fungi found in this study, may be expected to show continuous slow growth.

AB  - The biodiversity and terrestrial ecology of the Late Albian Triton Point Formation (Fossil Bluff Group), Alexander Island, Antarctica is analysed to improve our understanding of polar biomes during the mid-Cretaceous thermal optimum. This formation was deposited on a high-latitude (75 degreesS) floodplain and consists of two facies associations, a lower braided alluvial plain unit and an upper coastal meander-belt unit. Analysis of fossil plants in well exposed palaeosols reveals the existence of spatially complex plant communities. Braidplains supported patchy, low-density (91 trees/ha) stands of podocarp and taxodioid conifers on floodbasin substrates, and conifer-cycadophyte-fern-angiosperm thickets in riparian settings. Coastal meander-belts supported medium density (568 trees/ha) podocarp-araucarian conifer forests on mature floodbasin soils, and fern-angiosperm-ginkgo thickets in riparian settings. Growth-ring analysis indicates plants experienced stressful growing conditions on the braidplain characterized by high-frequency flood events, but more favourable growing conditions on the coastal plain. Additional vegetation disturbances were caused by arthropod-fungal attack, frost and wildfire. In terms of structure, composition, ecology and productivity these predominantly evergreen, broad-leafed conifer forests bear similarities to the extant temperate rainforests of New Zealand.

AB  - Walker Glacier near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic (terrestrial margin of the 'Last Ice Area') is undergoing rapid ice attrition in response to climate change. We applied culture and molecular methods to investigate fungal diversity at the terminus of this glacier. Analysis of the mycoflora composition showed that the Walker Glacier isolates separated into two clusters: the surface of the glacier ice and the glacier foreland. The recently exposed sediments of the foreland had a lower fungal diversity and different species from those on the ice, with the exception of five species that occurred in both habitats. This loss of glacial ice in the Arctic is therefore resulting in the loss of habitats for cold-dwelling fungal species. Fungal diversity is a potentially rich biological resource of glacial ecosystems, with unique taxa. The rapid loss of these glacial habitats underscores the urgency for genomic surveys of fungal diversity in the High Arctic, and the need for further isolation of strains as well as cryopreservation of environmental micro-biome samples for future research and conservation.

AB  - The composition of the terrestrial Antarctic flora and fauna and the distribution patterns of a number of species and of the principal vegetation types is now reasonably well established, at least in outline, for the Antarctic Peninsula region and the areas about McMurdo Sound as well as for some areas around the coastal ranges of East Antarctica. Detailed research at Signy Island has provided information concerning thebiomass and productivity of certain vegetation types, decomposer organisms, microbivores, and invertebrate herbivores and predators. The main pathways of energy and nutrient within the terrestrial study sites can be regarded as reasonably established. Net annual production locally reaches very high levels (up to 800 g m-2). Only a tiny part of this productivity is consumed by herbivores, the greater part passing to the decomposers or persisting as peat. Most of the animals are microbivores, or graze on fungi, and in turn sustain the small number of invertebrate predators. Analysis of the range of habitats even on Signy Island indicates however that the sites for which detailed ecological information is available represent only a part of the range of environmental and ecological variation. The island is characterized by a very high level of within-site diversity, some of it on a very small scale. Similarly, recent research which permits ecological comparisons with the Subantarctic islands of South Georgia and Macquarie, and with the McMurdo area, confirms that Signy Island displays only a small part of the very large range of diversity within the antarctic regions as a whole. It is a reasonably representative sample of the Maritime Antarctic zone in the Antarctic Peninsula region where conditions are particularly favorable for terrestrial life. Its ecological features resemble most closely those of the South Shetland Islands (except over permeable volcanic rocks) and the Palmer Archipelago on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. Very different plant and animal communities occur over much of the McMurdo Sound region and in the inland ranges of East Antarctica. Some general statements can now be made about the relationships between terrestrial antarctic eco-systems and climatic, edaphic and historical factors. There is a clearly marked attenuation of the vegetation and fauna and simplification of the ecological systems as one moves towards cold, arid continental conditions. But the biota of the Maritime Antarctic and the Subantarctic islands is more impoverished than ecological factors alone would indicate because of the isolation of these land habitats, many of which have only recently been deglaciated. If present environmental conditions persist, a slow increase in the complexity of these ecological systems is to be expected and in some areas, especially the subantarctic islands, this process is being accelerated by human influence.

AB  - Despite low temperatures, poor nutrient levels and high pressure, microorganisms thrive in deep-sea environments of polar regions. The adaptability to such extreme environments renders deep-sea microorganisms an encouraging source of novel, bioactive secondary metabolites. In this study, we isolated 77 microorganisms collected by a remotely operated vehicle from the seafloor in the Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean (depth of 2454 m). Thirty-two bacteria and six fungal strains that represented the phylogenetic diversity of the isolates were cultured using an One-Strain-Many-Compounds (OSMAC) approach. The crude EtOAc extracts were tested for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. While antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium was common for many isolates, only two bacteria displayed anticancer activity, and two fungi inhibited the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Due to bioactivity against C. albicans and rich chemical diversity based on molecular network-based untargeted metabolomics, Aspergillus versicolor PS108-62 was selected for an in-depth chemical investigation. A chemical work-up of the SPE-fractions of its dichloromethane subextract led to the isolation of a new PKS-NRPS hybrid macrolactone, versicolide A (1), a new quinazoline (-)-isoversicomide A (3), as well as three known compounds, burnettramic acid A (2), cyclopenol (4) and cyclopenin (5). Their structures were elucidated by a combination of HRMS, NMR, [alpha](D), FT-IR spectroscopy and computational approaches. Due to the low amounts obtained, only compounds 2 and 4 could be tested for bioactivity, with 2 inhibiting the growth of C. albicans (IC50 7.2 mu g/mL). These findings highlight, on the one hand, the vast potential of the genus Aspergillus to produce novel chemistry, particularly from underexplored ecological niches such as the Arctic deep sea, and on the other, the importance of untargeted metabolomics for selection of marine extracts for downstream chemical investigations.

AB  - Acid phosphatase production by 12 Hebeloma strains was usually derepressed when inorganic phosphorus in the growth medium was limited, but appeared to be constitutive in some strains. At low temperatures(less than or equal to 12 degrees) arctic strains produced more extracellular and wall-bound acid phosphatase, yet grew more slowly than the temperate strains. We suggest that low growth rates in arctic strains may be a physiological response to cold whereby resources are diverted into carbohydrate accumulation for cryoprotection. At near freezing temperatures, increased extracellular phosphatase production may compensate for a loss of enzyme activity at low temperature and serve to hydrolyse organic phosphorus in frozen soil over winter.

AB  - The chemical and microbiological properties of urban soils (Urbic Technosols) of Murmansk (Russia) are compared with those in podzols (Albic Podzols) of the background area. Urban soils display increased pH values and higher contents of major biogenic elements: C, N, P, and K, especially pronounced in subsoil horizons. In the urban topsoils, the number of cultured bacteria are increased (saprotrophs, to 3-6 x 10(6) CFU/g and oligotrophs, to 4.5-8 x 10(6) CFU/g), whereas the number of cultured microscopic fungi are decreased by two orders of magnitude (to 10(3) CFU) as compared with native podzols. As for the urban subsoil horizons, the number of all groups of microorganisms are increased as compared with the background. The diversity of micromycete complexes in urban soils follows the same pattern. Spatial nonuniformity of the species composition and structure of microfungal complexes is observed in the urban topsoils versus the subsoils, which display a relative uniformity of the dominant species composition (Trichocladium griseum, relative abundance of 41-77%). The share and abundance of BSL-1 and BSL-2 opportunistic micromycetes increase in the urban topsoils to 50-60% versus native podzols with the share of 30%. The degree of mycological hazard in urban soils varies from dangerous to safe (index of mycological hazard Im values are from 7-20 in the city center to 1.5-3.6 in the suburbs). The results demonstrate that urbanization in the Arctic not only changes the chemical properties of soils but also creates a new niche for microorganisms in subsoil horizons.

AB  - Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi differ in their abilities to use nitrogen sources and may be integral to maintaining fungal and plant diversity in ecosystems in which Ericaceae occur. In this study, we tested whether the fungal communities differ among three species of co-occurring Ericaceae.
   Fungi colonizing Cassiope tetragona, Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium vitisidaea roots in the Arctic tundra were characterized via culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The cultured fungi were tested for their ability to colonize Vaccinium uliginosum in laboratory-based assays.
   The pure-cultured Helotiales were grouped into eight clades and dominated by the Phialocephala-Acephala complex. Representatives of these clades, plus an unknown basidiomycete with affinity to the genus Irpex (Polyporales), colonized V. uliginosum intracellularly. The Helotiales detected by direct PCR, cloning and sequencing were assigned to 14 clades and dominated by members of the Rhizoscyphus ericae complex. Ordination analyses indicated that culture-dependent and culture-independent assays provided distinct views of root fungal communities, but no evidence for host specificity.
   These data suggest that ericaceous roots host diverse fungal communities dominated by the Helotiales. However, these fungal communities are unlikely to be controlled by fungal host preferences. The mechanisms maintaining high diversity in root-symbiotic communities remain to be elucidated.

AB  - Harsh and extreme environments, such as Antarctica, offer unique opportunities to explore new microbial taxa and biomolecules. Given the limited knowledge on microbial diversity, this study aimed to compile, analyze and compare a subset of the biobank of Antarctic fungi maintained at the UNESP's Central of Microbial Resources (CRM-UNESP). A total of 711 isolates (240 yeasts and 471 filamentous fungi) from marine and terrestrial samples collected at King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) were used with the primary objective of investigating their presence in both marine and terrestrial environments. Among the yeasts, 13 genera were found, predominantly belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. Among the filamentous fungi, 34 genera were represented, predominantly from the phylum Ascomycota. The most abundant genera in the marine samples were Metschnikowia, Mrakia, and Pseudogymnoascus, while in the terrestrial samples, they were Pseudogymnoascus, Leucosporidium, and Mortierella. Most of the genera and species of the CRM-UNESP biobank of Antarctic fungi are being reported as an important target for biotechnological applications. This study showed the relevance of the CRM-UNESP biobank, highlighting the importance of applying standard methods for the preservation of the biological material and associated data (BMaD), as recommended in national and international standards.

AB  - Previous studies of fungi in polar environments have revealed a prevalence of basidiomycetous yeasts in soil and in subglacial environments of polythermal glaciers. Ascomycetous yeasts have rarely been reported from extremely cold natural environments, even though they are known contaminants of frozen foods. Using media with low water activity, we have isolated various yeast species from the subglacial ice of four glaciers from the coastal Arctic environment of Kongsfjorden, Spitzbergen, including Debaryomyces hansenii and Pichia guillermondii, with counts reaching 10(4) CFU L-1. Together with the basidiomycetes Cryptococcus liquefaciens and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, these yeasts represent the stable core of the subglacial yeast communities. Other glacial ascomycetous species isolated included Candida parapsilosis and a putative new species that resembles Candida pseudorugosa. The archiascomycete Protomyces inouyei has seldom been detected anywhere in the world but was here recovered from ice in a glacier cave. The glacier meltwater contained only D. hansenii, whereas the seawater contained D. hansenii, Debaryomyces maramus, Pichia guilliermondii, what appears to represent a novel species resembling Candida galli and Metschnikowia bicuspidata. Only P. guilliermondii was isolated from sea ice, while snow/ice in the fjord tidal zone included C. parapsilosis, D. hansenii, P. guilliermondii and Metschnikowia zobellii. All of these isolated strains were characterized as psychrotolerant and xero/halotolerant, with the exception of P. inouyei.

AB  - Microbial adaptations to extreme environments can lead to biotechnological applications. This study aimed to evaluate the resistance of Antarctic Cladosporium to adverse conditions (temperature, salinity, UV radiation, and nutrients) and refine their taxonomy. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis using ITS- act markers resulted in a more accurate taxonomic identification, revealing the presence of five different species, belonging to the complexes C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum. . The growth at different temperatures indicates that the soil isolates LAMAI 564 and 1800 (phylogenetically closely related) and LAMAI 2541 are psychrophilic, while the other isolates are psychrotolerant. The fungi isolated from the saline samples LAMAI 595, 616, and 1369 showed better growth results at higher salinity (15%). The fungi most resistant to UV radiation were isolated from terrestrial and marine samples (LAMAI 595, 616, 1800, and 564). LAMAI 595 and 616 (phylogenetically closely related and isolated from the same kind of sample) showed the capacity of nutritional versatility, growing well in both rich and poor-nutrient media. The fungus LAMAI 595 was the most promising for biotechnological application, exceeding the other isolates in the harsh conditions studied. The resistance of the Antarctic Cladosporium to adverse conditions opens new perspectives in the field of applied microbiology of extremophiles.

AB  - This study assessed the diversity and distribution of fungal communities associated with seven lichen species in the Ny-Alesund Region (Svalbard, High Arctic) using Roche 454 pyrosequencing with fungal-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene. Lichen-associated fungal communities showed high diversity, with a total of 42,259 reads belonging to 370 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being found. Of these OTUs, 294 belonged to Ascomycota, 54 to Basidiomycota, 2 to Zygomycota, and 20 to unknown fungi. Leotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes were the major classes, whereas the dominant orders were Helotiales, Capnodiales, and Chaetothyriales. Interestingly, most fungal OTUs were closely related to fungi from various habitats (e.g., soil, rock, plant tissues) in the Arctic, Antarctic and alpine regions, which suggests that living in association with lichen thalli may be a transient stage of life cycle for these fungi and that long-distance dispersal may be important to the fungi in the Arctic. In addition, host-related factors shaped the lichen-associated fungal communities in this region. Taken together, these results suggest that lichens thalli act as reservoirs of diverse fungi from various niches, which may improve our understanding of fungal evolution and ecology in the Arctic.

AB  - Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC MS) and bulk carbon isotope determinations have been performed on samples ('cemented organic residues', charcoal, sediment and fire-cracked rock) excavated from 12 slab-lined pits from various locations in Arctic Norway to test the premise that these archaeological features were used for the extraction of oil from the blubber of marine mammals, such as seal, whale and walrus. A wide range of lipid compound classes were detected especially in the cemented organic residues and in the charcoal samples. The presence of long-chain unsaturated and isoprenoid fatty acids together with oxidation and thermal alteration products of unsaturated acids such as dicarboxylic acids, dihydroxyfatty acids and omega-(o-alkylphenyl)alkanoic acids suggests that these features were used for marine oil extraction at elevated temperatures. Notably the location of the hydroxyl groups in the dihydroxyfatty acids provides a record of the positional isomer of the precursor fatty acid and allows confirmation that 11-docosenoic (cetoleic) acid, the most abundant C-22:1 isomer in marine oil, was a major component of the original lipid. Further information was provided by the presence of long-chain fatty acyl moieties in surviving triacylglycerols and the presence of cholesterol. A fungal metabolite, mycose (trehalose), was found in all samples apart from a fire-cracked rock and points to microbiological activity in the pits. Bulk isotope analysis conducted on the 'cemented organic residues' is consistent with modern reference samples of blubber and oil from seal and whale. These data provide clear analytical evidence of the function of slab-lined pits in the archaeological record and suggest widespread exploitation of marine mammals for producing oil for heating, lighting and myriad other uses in the past.

AB  - A novel Gram-stain-negative bacterium, strain CY03(T), was isolated from sediment of the Yellow Sea, PR China. Cells of strain CY03(T) were rods, aerobic and non-flagellated. Growth occurred at 5-40 degrees C (optimum, 30 degrees C), pH 5.5-9.5 (pH 7.5) and with 0.5-9.0 % NaCl (1.5-2.0 %). The 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison showed affiliation to the family Rhodobacteraceae with Puniceibacterium confluentis (97.0 %) as the most closely related species, followed by members of the genus Pseudooceanicola, Pseudooceanicola antarcticus (96.8 %) and Pseudooceanicola nitratireducens (96.7 %). The major cellular fatty acids were cyclo-C-19:0 omega 8c, C-16:0, summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c) and 11-methyl C-18:1 omega 7c. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified phospholipid, one unidentified aminolipid and five unidentified lipids. The predominant respiratory quinone was Q-10. The DNA G+C content of the type strain was 62.8 mol%. Based on the results of the polyphasic characterization for strain CY03(T), it represents a novel species of a novel genus of the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which the name Pseudopuniceibacterium sediminis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CY03(T )(=CCTCC AB 2017195(T)=KCTC 62198(T)).

AB  - Penicillium species are common fungi found worldwide from diverse substrates, including soil, plant debris, food products and air. Their diversity in aquatic environments is still underexplored. With the aim to explore the fungal diversity in Spanish freshwater sediments, numerous Penicillium strains were isolated using various culture-dependent techniques. A preliminary sequence analysis of the beta-tubulin (tub2) gene marker allowed us to identify several interesting species of Penicillium, which were later characterized phylogenetically with the barcodes recommended for species delimitation in the genus. Based on the multi-locus phylogeny of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA, and partial fragments of tub2, calmodulin (cmdA), and the RNA polymerase II largest subunit (rpb2) genes, in combination with phenotypic analyses, five novel species are described. These are P. ausonanum in section Lanata-Divaricata, P. guarroi in sect. Gracilenta, P. irregulare in sect. Canescentia, P. sicoris in sect. Paradoxa and P. submersum in sect. Robsamsonia. The study of several isolates from samples collected in different locations resulted in the reinstatement of P. vaccaeorum into section Citrina. Finally, P. heteromorphum (sect. Exilicaulis) and P. tardochrysogenum (sect. Chrysogena) are reported, previously only known from Antarctica and China, respectively.

AB  - Atmospheric sounding using the Tu-134 Optik aircraft-laboratory was conducted in September 2020 over the seas of the Russian sector of the Arctic Ocean, namely the Barents, Kara, Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi and Bering seas. Unique samples of atmospheric aerosols at altitudes from 200 and up to 10,000 m were taken, including samples for the identification of cultivated microorganisms and their genetic analysis. Data on the concentration and diversity of bacteria and fungi isolated from 24 samples of atmospheric aerosols are presented; the main phenotypic and genomic characteristics were obtained for 152 bacterial cultures; and taxonomic belonging was determined. The concentration of cultured microorganisms detected in aerosols of different locations was similar, averaging 5.5 x 103 CFU/m3. No dependence of the number of isolated microorganisms on the height and location of aerosol sampling was observed. The presence of pathogenic and condto shitionally pathogenic bacteria, including those referred to in the genera Staphylococcus, Kocuria, Rothia, Comamonas, Brevundimonas, Acinetobacter, and others, as well as fungi represented by the widely spread genera Aureobasidium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Penicillium, capable of causing infectious and allergic diseases were present in most analyzed samples. Obtained data reveal the necessity of systematic studies of atmospheric microbiota composition to combat emerging population diseases.

AB  - PLANT growth in arctic tundra is strongly nitrogen-limited despite large pools of soil organic nitrogen1-4. Here we report that field-collected roots of Eriophorum vaginatum, an arctic sedge, rapidly absorb free amino acids, accounting for at least 60% of the nitrogen absorbed by this species in the field. In solution culture, Eriophorum accumulates more nitrogen and biomass when supplied with amino acids than when grown on inorganic nitrogen, whereas Hordeum vulgare (a cereal adapted to mineral soils) grows least when nitrogen is supplied as amino acids. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of preferential absorption and use of organic nitrogen by a non-mycorrhizal vascular plant. The direct absorption of amino acids by Eriophorum short-circuits the bottle-neck in arctic nitrogen cycles imposd by temperature-limited mineralization.

AB  - We recovered 195 fungal isolates from the sediments of different lakes in the Antarctic Peninsula, which were screened to detect bioactive compounds. Forty-two taxa belonging to the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mortierellomycota were identified. Thelebolus globosus, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Pseudogymnoascus verrucosus, Vishniacozyma victoriae, and Phenoliferia sp. were found to be the most prevalent. The fungal assemblages showed high diversity and richness, but low dominance values. However, the diversity indices and fungal distribution ranged according to the different lake sediments. Sixty fungal extracts displayed at least one biological activity against the evaluated targets. Among them, Pseudogymnoascus destructans showed selective trypanocidal activity, Cladosporium sp. 1 and Trichoderma polysporum showed antifungal activity, and Pseudogymnoascus appendiculatus and Helotiales sp. showed high herbicidal activity. We detected a rich and diverse fungal community composed of cold cosmopolitan and psychrophilic endemic taxa recognized as decomposers, symbiotics, pathogens, and potential new species, in the sediments of Antarctic lakes. The dynamics and balance of this fungal community represents an interesting aquatic web model for further ecological and evolutionary studies under extreme conditions and potential climate changes in the regions. In addition, we detected fungal taxa and isolates able to produce bioactive compounds that may represent the source of prototype molecules for applications in medicine and agriculture.

AB  - High amounts of driftwood sail across the oceans and provide habitat for organisms tolerating the rough and saline environment. Fungi have adapted to the extremely cold and saline conditions which driftwood faces in the high north. For the first time, we applied high-throughput sequencing to fungi residing in driftwood to reveal their taxonomic richness, community composition, and ecology in the North Atlantic. Using pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons obtained from 49 marine logs, we found 807 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustering at 97 % sequence similarity cut-off level. The phylum Ascomycota comprised 74 % of the OTUs and 20 % belonged to Basidiomycota. The richness of basidiomycetes decreased with prolonged submersion in the sea, supporting the general view of ascomycetes being more extremotolerant. However, more than one fourth of the fungal OTUs remained unassigned to any fungal class, emphasising the need for better DNA reference data from the marine habitat. Different fungal communities were detected in coniferous and deciduous logs. Our results highlight that driftwood hosts a considerably higher fungal diversity than currently known. The driftwood fungal community is not a terrestrial relic but a speciose assemblage of fungi adapted to the stressful marine environment and different kinds of wooden substrates found in it.

AB  - We studied the culturable fungal community recovered from deep marine sediments in the maritime Antarctic, and assessed their capabilities to produce exoenzymes, emulsifiers and metabolites with phytotoxic activity. Sixty-eight Ascomycota fungal isolates were recovered and identified. The most abundant taxon recovered was the yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii, followed by the filamentous fungi Penicillium chrysogenum, P. cf. palitans, Pseudeurotium cf. bakeri, Thelebolus balaustiformis, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and Cladosporium sp. Diversity indices displayed low values overall, with the highest values obtained at shallow depth, decreasing to the deepest location sampled. Only M. guilliermondii and P. cf. palitans were detected in the sediments at all depths sampled, and were the most abundant taxa at all sample sites. The most abundant enzymes detected were proteases, followed by invertases, cellulases, lipases, carrageenases, agarases, pectinases and esterases. Four isolates showed good biosurfactant activity, particularly the endemic species A. psychrotrophicus. Twenty-four isolates of P. cf. palitans displayed strong phytotoxic activities against the models Lactuca sativa and Allium schoenoprasum. The cultivable fungi recovered demonstrated good biosynthetic activity in the production of hydrolytic exoenzymes, biosurfactant molecules and metabolites with phytotoxic activity, reinforcing the importance of documenting the taxonomic, ecological and biotechnological properties of fungi present in deep oceanic sediments of the Southern Ocean.

AB  - Aims
   Competition has been shown to modify the niche breadth of coexisting species, but within-species interactions have received little attention. Establishing small juvenile individuals and established, larger, sexually reproducing adult individuals represent two life-history stages within species. We investigated the nitrogen and carbon resource use of adult and juvenile individuals and similarity of symbiotic fungal community composition in these two plant life stages. We used the plant Solidago virgaurea growing in a simplified system in the low Arctic as model species.
   Methods
   Isotopic signatures (foliar delta N-15 and foliar delta C-13) were analysed to characterize nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency of the plants. Symbiotic root fungal community composition was estimated by cloning and sequencing small subunit ribosomal RNA gene.
   Important Findings
   The isotopic signatures differed significantly between the life stages, indicating that the establishing juvenile cohort used relatively more amino acids or gained N through mycorrhizal symbiosis in comparison to the established adult plants. Symbiotic fungal communities did not differ between the two plant cohorts suggesting a possibility that the plants shared the same mycorrhizal network. We conclude that competition-mediated differences in plant resource use may create niche differentiation between the two life-history stages and enable them to coexist.

AB  - Rock varnish occurs in virtually all environments, most commonly in arid and semi-arid climates, including Antarctica.  Rock varnish consists of thin layers of intimately mixed aeolian and chemical sediments often showing botryoidal and more rarely stromatolite-like morphologies.  Typical rock varnish samples collected at Twin Peak Mountain Park, near Phoenix, Arizona, consist of abundant quartz, with plagioclase, illite and a mixed layer, Fe-clay mineral, probably corrensite.  EDS, SEM (BSE) and TEM analyses revealed that the typical Mn, Fe minerals occur as minute particles; some of these particles and other mineral grains are attached to filaments.  XRD and electron diffraction showed that the Mn,Fe-bearing particles are poorly crystalline.  The filaments, based on morphological criteria, are virtually indistinguishable from fungal filaments.  Most filaments are fragments, probably broken by scraping during sample collection.  Coccoid and rod-shaped forms, resembling cyanobacteria and other bacteria, respectively, are also present.  Unlike definitive minerals, these filaments disintegrated in the concentrated energy of the SEM electron beam at the instrumental and experimental conditions used.  In addition, no filamentous, rod-shaped or coccoid forms were observed in samples hydrolysed with 6 N HCl for 24 h at 100-degrees-C.  Bacteria and fungi in powdered rock varnish were cultured on four media, incubated aerobically in the dark at 25-degrees-C.  The culture media yielded dense growths of spore-forming bacteria and filamentous fungi.  One fungus and two Bacillus isolates oxidized and concentrated manganese.  Control experiments revealed that fungi and bacteria are present on and below the surfaces of rock varnish.  Free and hydrolysed, peptide/protein-bound amino acids were identified in the rock varnish.  Amino acids showed virtually no racemization with the exception of D/L asp = 0.1.  Relatively high molecular weight humic matter was also separated from the rock varnish.  High-resolution mass spectrometry revealed non-hydrocarbon moieties, similar to a Suwannee River (FL) humic acid standard.  Micro-organisms and their original biochemical compounds do not seem to be preserved for long in the accreting varnish layer.  The studies showed that the filaments helped to trap mineral particles of rock varnish, and that bacteria and fungi abetted Mn concentration.  Some structures in the layers of rock varnish resemble stromatolites and present definitions would allow them to be termed as such.

AB  - The 318m thick lacustrine sediment record from Lake El'gygytgyn, northeastern Russian Arctic cored by the international El'gygytgyn Drilling Project provides unique opportunities for the time-continuous reconstruction of the regional paleoenvironmental history for the past 3.6 Myr. Pollen studies of the lower 216 m of the lacustrine sediments demonstrate their value as an excellent archive of vegetation and climate changes during the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. About 3.5-3.35 Myr BP, the vegetation at Lake El'gygytgyn, now an area of tundra was dominated by spruce-larch-fir-hemlock forests. After ca. 3.35 Myr BP dark coniferous taxa gradually disappeared. A very pronounced environmental change took place ca. 3.31-3.28 Myr BP, corresponding to the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2, when treeless tundra-and steppe-like habitats became dominant in the regional vegetation. Climate conditions were similar to those of Late Pleistocene cold intervals. Numerous coprophilous fungi spores identified in the pollen samples suggest the presence of grazing animals around the lake. Following the MIS M2 event, larch-pine forests with some spruce mostly dominated the area until ca. 2.6 Myr BP, interrupted by colder and drier intervals ca. 3.043-3.025, 2.935-2.912, and 2.719-2.698 Myr BP. At the beginning of the Pleistocene, ca. 2.6 Myr BP, noticeable climatic deterioration occurred. Forested habitats changed to predominantly treeless and shrubby environments, which reflect a relatively cold and dry climate. Peaks in observed green algae colonies (Botryococcus) around 2.53, 2.45, 2.32-2.305, 2.20 and 2.16-2.15 Myr BP suggest a spread of shallow water environments. A few intervals (i.e., 2.55-2.53, ca. 2.37, and 2.35-2.32 Myr BP) with a higher presence of coniferous taxa (mostly pine and larch) document some relatively short-term climate ameliorations during Early Pleistocene glacial periods.

AB  - Comparative characterization of Geomyces isolates was performed. The isolates were obtained from Arctic cryopegs and the surrounding ancient marine deposits, from nonsaline permafrost soils, and from temperate environments. Microbiological (cultural and morphological) and molecular criteria were used to confirm the identification of the isolates as Geomyces pannorum. The isolates from cryopegs and surrounding marine deposits were shown to differ from those obtained from nonsaline soils and temperate environments in their ability to grow at negative temperatures (-2 degrees C) under increased salt concentration (10%). The results are discussed in relation to the possible inheritance of the adaptive characteristics acquired in specific environments.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a common pathogen in domestic ruminants that causes granulomatous inflammation of the small intestine leading to emaciation and wasting. Clinical disease (Johne's disease) is also reported for several wild ruminant species. Between 2007 and 2009 we collected 561 fecal samples from caribou (Rangifer tarandus ssp.) representing 10 herds of migratory caribou, two herds of caribou from Greenland, and three populations of boreal woodland caribou. Feces were tested for MAP by bacterial culture and PCR targeting the IS900 insertion sequence. In total, 31 samples from eight different populations representing all three ecotypes were found positive for MAP by PCR, with one sample from the Riviere-aux-Feuilles herd also being culture positive for the type II (cattle) strain. The proportion of positive animals was particularly high in the Akia-Maniitsoq herd in Greenland, and Riviere-aux-Feuilles and Riviere-George herds in northeastern Canada (2:3.4, 11..5, and 10.0%, respectively). Our results indicate that MAP is present in several caribou herds of different ecotypes in northern Canada and Greenland and that MAP circulates within wildlife populations that do not have ongoing contact with domestic livestock. The epidemiology, pathogenicity, and effects on the health of caribou in northern ecosystems remain unknown.

AB  - The Deception Island, located in Maritime Antarctica, is a volcanic island with geothermal activity and one of the most visited by tourists. However, the extent of the anthropogenic impact remains largely unknown and the factors shaping the resistance/tolerance mechanisms in the microbiomes from Whalers Bay ecosystems have never been investigated. In this context, this study aimed to reveal the resistome profiles of Whalers Bay sediments and correlate them with environmental factors. Samples were collected at four sites during the summer 2014/2015 along a transect of 27.5 m in the Whalers Bay sediments. DNA isolated from sediment samples was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Bioinformatic analyses allowed the assembly of contigs and scaffolds, prediction of ORFs, and taxonomic and functional annotation using NCBI RefSeq database and KEGG orthology, respectively. Microorganisms belonging to the genera Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium and Polaromonas were shown to dominate all sites, representing 60% of taxonomic annotation. Arsenic (As), copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) were the most abundant metal resistance/tolerance types found in the microbiomes. Beta-lactam was the most common class related to antibiotics resistance/tolerance, corroborating with previous environmental resistome studies. The acridine class was the most abundant amongst the biocide resistance/tolerances, related to antiseptic compounds. Results gathered in this study reveal a repertoire of resistance/tolerance classes to antibiotics and biocides unusually found in Antarctica. However, given the volcanic nature (heavy metals-rich region) of Deception Island soils, this putative impact must be viewed with caution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A total of 71 isolates were collected from lake sediment and soil surrounding lakes in the Skarvsnes area, Antarctica. Based on ITS region sequence similarity, these isolates were classified to 10 genera. Twenty-three isolates were categorized as ascomycetous fungi from five genera (Embellisia, Phoma, Geomyces, Tetracladium or Thelebolus) and 48 isolates were categorized as basidiomycetous fungi in five genera (Mrakia, Cryptococcus, Dioszegia, Rhodotorula or Leucosporidium). Thirty-five percent of culturable fungi were of the genus Mrakia. Eighteen isolates from eight genera were selected and tested for both antifreeze activity and capacity for growth under temperatures ranging from -1 to 25 degrees C. Rhodotorula sp. NHT-2 possessed a high degree of sequence homology with R.gracialis, while Leucosporidium sp. BSS-1 possessed a high degree of sequence homology with Leu.antarcticum (Glaciozyma antarctica), and these two isolates demonstrated antifreeze activity. All isolates examined were capable of growth at -1 degrees C. Mrakia spp., while capable of growth at -1 degrees C, did not demonstrate any antifreeze activity and exhibited only limited secretion of extracellular polysaccharides. Species of the genus Mrakia possessed high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that members of this genus have adapted to cold environments by increasing their membrane fluidity.

AB  - Secondary metabolites of 25 Penicillium strains isolated from high-latitude ecosystems (upper layer of Antarctic soils and Arctic permafrost deposits) were analyzed. Out of the studied strains, 80% were found to produce secondary metabolites belonging to benzodiazepine alkaloids (anacin, cyclopenin, and cyclopeptin), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatin and 3-methoxyviridicatin), diketopiperazine alkaloids (aurantiamine, 3,12-dihydroroquefortine, roquefortine and rugulosuvin B), polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B and chaetoglobosine A), clavine ergot alkaloids (rugulovasins A and B, festuclavine, fumigaclavines A and B, and cyclopiazonic acid), polyketides (mycophenolic acid and citreoviridin), terpenes (andrastins A and B and phomenone), and N-acetyltriptamine. Most strains of the Penicillium subgenus isolated from anthropogenically impaired upper layers of Antarctic deposits and from subsurface Arctic deposits exhibited more complete spectra of secondary metabolites compared to three strains isolated from permafrost 15000 to 600000 years old. This is the first report on andrastins formation by a P. restrictum. Wide occurrence of rugulovasins in P. variabile strains was shown.

AB  - Previous research has shown that plant extracts, e.g. from boreal dwarf shrubs and trees, can cause reduced growth of neighbouring plants: an effect known as allelopathy. To examine whether arctic and subarctic plants could also be affected by leaching of phytochemicals, we added extracts from the commonly occurring arctic dwarf shrubs Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum hermaphroditum, and from mountain birch, Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa to three graminoid species, Carex bigelowii, Festuca vivipara and Luzula arcuata, grown in previously sterilized or non-sterilized arctic soils. The graminoids in non-sterilized soil grew more slowly than those in sterilized soil. Excised roots of the plants in non-sterilized soil had higher uptake rate of labelled P than those in sterilized soil, demonstrating larger nutrient deficiency. The difference in growth rate was probably caused by higher nutrient availability for plants in soils in which the microbial biomass was killed after soil sterilization. The dwarf shrub extracts contained low amounts of inorganic N and P and medium high amounts of carbohydrates. Betula extracts contained somewhat higher levels of N and much higher levels of P and carbohydrates. Addition of leaf extracts to the strongly nutrient limited graminoids in non-sterilized soil tended to reduce growth, whereas in the less nutrient Limited sterilized soil it caused strong growth decline. Furthermore, the N and P uptake by excised roots of plants grown in both types of soil was high if extracts from the dwarf shrubs (with low P and N concentrations) had been added, whereas the P uptake declined but the N uptake increased after addition of the P-rich Betula extract. In contrast to the adverse extract effects on plants, soil microbial respiration and soil fungal biomass (ergosterol) was generally stimulated, most strongly after addition of the Betula extract. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the reduced plant growth and the concomitant stimulation of microbial activity were caused by phytochemicals, we believe that this was more likely due to labile carbon in the extracts which stimulated microbial biomass and activity. As a result microbial uptake increased, thereby depleting the plant available pool of N and P, or, for the P-rich Betula extract, depleting soil in organic N alone, to the extent of reducing plant growth. This chain of events is supported by the negative correlation between plant growth and sugar content in the three added extracts, and the positive correlation between mi crobial activity, fungal biomass production and sugar content, and are known reactions when labile carbon is added to nutrient deficient soils.

AB  - This study characterized cultivable fungi present in sediments obtained from Boeckella Lake, Hope Bay, in the north-east of the Antarctic Peninsula, and evaluated their production of enzymes and biosurfactants of potential industrial interest. A total of 116 fungal isolates were obtained, which were classified into 16 genera within the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota, in rank. The most abundant genera of filamentous fungi included Pseudogymnoascus, Pseudeurotium and Antarctomyces; for yeasts, Thelebolales and Naganishia taxa were dominant. Overall, the lake sediments exhibited high fungal diversity and moderate richness and dominance. The enzymes esterase, cellulase and protease were the most abundantly produced by these fungi. Ramgea cf. ozimecii, Holtermanniella wattica, Leucosporidium creatinivorum, Leucosporidium sp., Mrakia blollopis, Naganishia sp. and Phenoliferia sp. displayed enzymatic index > 2. Fourteen isolates of filamentous fungi demonstrated an Emulsification Index 24% (EI24%) >= 50%; among them, three isolates of A. psychrotrophicus showed an EI24% > 80%. Boeckella Lake itself is in the process of drying out due to the impact of regional climate change, and may be lost completely in approaching decades, therefore hosts a threatened community of cultivable fungi that produce important biomolecules with potential application in biotechnological processes.

AB  - The ecology of tundra terrestrial environments has gained increasing attention due to potential major changes resulting from global warming and climate change. However, the composition of terrestrial microbial communities and their role in the biogeochemical carbon cycle are less well studied. This is the first report of the C-biomass of bacteria, fungi, and representative protozoa (heterotrophic nanoflagellates, naked amoebae, and testate amoebae) in Alaskan tundra soil samples, and the effects of glucose solution enrichment in laboratory studies simulating release of soluble organic compounds as may occur during permafrost melt and increased plant root exudates due to global warming. The data for three moss-rich surface samples, two in spring and one in summer (2011), are reported for C-supplemented (8,000 mu g glucose-C) and non-supplemented treatments in laboratory culture. Seven days after supplementation, fungal C-biomass in the glucose-treated and untreated samples were similar in the range of 5 to 11 mg g(-1) soil dry weight, the highest values in the summer samples. The bacterial C-biomass was the next highest in the range of 20 to 120 mu g g(-1) soil dry weight, followed by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (2 to 14 mu g g(-1) soil dry weight). The naked amoebae (0.13 to 0.94 mu g C g(-1) soil dry weight) and testate amoebae (2 to 20 ng C g(-1) soil dry weight) contributed the least C-biomass. All of the bacterial and protozoan treatments showed increased biomass with glucose supplementation. Based on size, and C-biomass estimates, the phagotrophic protozoa appear to be organized in a classical bacterial-based trophic hierarchy (i.e. bacteria - nanoflagellates - naked amoebae - testate amoebae, in ascending order). Correlations of the C-biomass of bacteria to each of the protozoa, provided further evidence of a trophic pyramid; bacteria vs. nanoflagellates (r = -0.986), indicating top-down control by predatory flagellates, bacteria vs. naked amoebae (r = -0.361) and bacteria vs. testate amoebae (r = -0.131), each of decreasing magnitude as would be predicted for higher level consumers. Estimates of bacterial predation indicated strong predatory pressures on bacteria by the protozoa, greater with C-supplementation compared to the non-supplemented treatments.

AB  - Arctic and temperate strains of Hebeloma spp, were grown in axenic culture on glutamic acid, alanine, lysine and NH4+ as sole sources of nitrogen (N), with excess carbon (C) or deficient C (supplied as glucose). Their ability to utilize seed protein as a natural N source was also assessed. AU strains tested had the capacity to assimilate amino acids and generally utilized alanine and glutamic acid more readily than NH4+. Some strains were able to utilize amino C when starved of glucose C, and could mineralize amino-N to NH8-N. Arctic strains, in particular, appeared to be pre-adapted to the utilization of seed protein N and glutamic acid N, which is often liberated in high concentrations after soil freezing. The results are discussed in relation to their possible ecological importance.

AB  - The relevance of the Arctic regions' study is rapidly increasing due to the sensitive response of fragile ecosystems to climate change and anthropogenic pressure. The microbiome is an important component that determines the soils' functioning and an indicator of changes occurring in ecosystems. Rybachy Peninsula is the northernmost part of the continental European Russia and is almost completely surrounded by Barents Sea water. For the first time, the microbial communities of the Entic Podzol, Albic Podzol, Rheic Histosol and Folic Histosol as well as anthropogenically disturbed soils (chemical pollution and human impact, growing crops) on the Rybachy Peninsula were characterized using plating and fluorescence microscopy methods, in parallel with the enzymatic activity of soils. The amount and structure of soil microbial biomass, such as the total biomass of fungi and prokaryote, the length and diameter of fungal and actinomycete mycelium, the proportion of spores and mycelium in the fungal biomass, the number of spores and prokaryotic cells, the proportion of small and large fungal spores and their morphology were determined. In the soils of the peninsula, the fungal biomass varied from 0.121 to 0.669 mg/g soil. The biomass of prokaryotes in soils ranged from 9.22 to 55.45 mu g/g of soil. Fungi predominated, the proportion of which in the total microbial biomass varied from 78.5 to 97.7%. The number of culturable microfungi ranged from 0.53 to 13.93 x 10(3) CFU/g in the topsoil horizons, with a maximum in Entic Podzol and Albic Podzol soils and a minimum in anthropogenically disturbed soil. The number of culturable copiotrophic bacteria varied from 41.8 x 10(3) cells/g in a cryogenic spot to 5551.3 x 10(3) cells /g in anthropogenically disturbed soils. The number of culturable oligotrophic bacteria ranged from 77.9 to 12,059.6 x 10(3) cells/g. Changes in natural soils because of anthropogenic impact and a change in vegetation types have led to a change in the structure of the community of soil microorganisms. Investigated tundra soils had high enzymatic activity in native and anthropogenic conditions. The beta-glucosidase and urease activity were comparable or even higher than in the soils of more southern natural zone, and the activity of dehydrogenase was 2-5 times lower. Thus, despite the subarctic climatic conditions, local soils have a significant biological activity upon which the productivity of ecosystems largely depends. The soils of the Rybachy Peninsula have a powerful enzyme pool due to the high adaptive potential of soil microorganisms to the extreme conditions of the Arctic, which allows them to perform their functions even under conditions of anthropogenic interference.

AB  - Metabarcoding technologies for soil fungal DNA pools have enabled to capture the diversity of fungal community and the agreement of their beta-diversity with plant beta-diversity. However, processes underlying the synchrony of the aboveground-belowground biodiversity is still unclear. By using partitioning methods for plant beta-diversity, this study explored the process driving synchrony in tundra ecosystems, in which drastic vegetation shifts are observed with climate warming. Our methods based on Baselga's partitioning enabled the division of plant beta-diversity into two phenomena and three functional components. Correlation of fungal beta-diversity with the components of plant beta-diversity showed that the spatial replacement of fungi was promoted by plant species turnover, in particular, plant species turnover with functional exchange. In addition, spatial variety of graminoid or forbs species, rather than shrubs, enhanced fungal beta-diversity. These results suggest the importance of small-scale factors such as plant-fungal interactions or local environments modified by plants for the fungal community assemblage. The process-based understanding of community dynamics of plants and fungi allows us to predict the ongoing shrub encroachment in the Arctic region, which could weaken the aboveground-belowground synchrony.

AB  - Snow is the largest component of the cryosphere, with its cover and distribution rapidly decreasing over the last decade due to climate warming. It is imperative to characterize the snow (nival) microbial communities to better understand the role of microorganisms inhabiting these rapidly changing environments. Here, we investigated the core nival microbiome, the cultivable microbial members, and the microbial functional diversity of the remote Uapishka mountain range, a massif of alpine sub-arctic tundra and boreal forest. Snow samples were taken over a two-month interval along an altitude gradient with varying degree of anthropogenic traffic and vegetation cover. The core snow alpine tundra/boreal microbiome, which was present across all samples, constituted of Acetobacterales, Rhizobiales and Acidobacteriales bacterial orders, and of Mycosphaerellales and Lecanorales fungal orders, with the dominant fungal taxa being associated with lichens. The snow samples had low active functional diversity, with Richness values ranging from 0 to 19.5. The culture-based viable microbial enumeration ranged from 0 to 8.05 x 103 CFUs/mL. We isolated and whole-genome sequenced five microorganisms which included three fungi, one alga, and one potentially novel bacterium of the Lichenihabitans genus; all of which appear to be part of lichen-associated taxonomic clades.
   The snow microbial community of a remote and protected sub-arctic alpine tundra is characterized by a low functional diversity and is dominated by lichen-associated bacterial and fungal taxa.

AB  - At a high arctic, polar semi-desert site (79 degrees N) in Svalbard, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were added to the soil for 5 yr to simulate increases in decomposition and nutrient mineralization which may occur as a result of increases in soil temperature and soil moisture caused by environmental change. Abundance of decomposer fungal species, isolated from standing-dead leaves of Dryas octopetala, varied between fertilized and unfertilized plots. Fungal biodiversity, as indicated by the Brillouin index, was lower in dead Dryas leaves from the fertilized plots, although more colonies were isolated from leaves of plants which had been fertilized. The fungi were cosmopolitan and not restricted to tundra areas. The dead leaves from the fertilized plots contained more nitrogen and phosphorus than those of the unfertilized plants. Leaves in the fertilized plots appeared to have been killed by winter injury resulting from an extended growing season in an atypically mild and wet autumn, which was followed quickly by extreme subzero temperatures.

AB  - The effect of temperature on the growth of Chrysosporium pannorum, Cylindrocarpon sp., Penicillium janthinellum and Phoma herbarum, isolated from tundra soils, was studied. The growth in 2 systems, glucose-mineral agar plates and sand, moistened with glucose-mineral broth, was compared. All isolates showed an exponential increase in mass (measured as protein increase) in sand and a linear rate of extension on agar. Radial increase on agar was shown not to be a good index of growth in sand. Trends in growth rates in the sand cultures indicated that all 4 fungi can grow at low temperatures. The growth rate for P. janthinellum at 15.degree. C was higher than at 20.degree. C, and Cylindrocarpon sp. and P. herbarum had higher growth rates at 2.5.degree. C than at 5.degree. C. These data suggest that there may be some adaptation by these fungi to growth in Arctic regions.

AB  - Adaptive reactions of Arctic and Antarctic strains of psychrophilic micromycetes Geomyces pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus to growth within a broad temperature range were studied. Adaptation of these species to different temperatures was found to result from both morphological and biochemical changes, including changes in the concentration of small molecules and lipid membrane components. These biochemical, morphological, and physiological mechanisms exhibited the patterns common to all strains, as well as species and strain differences. The general patterns included temperature-dependent changes in amounts of monosaccharides, some disaccharides, and free linoleic and linolenic acids. The differences between the Arctic and Antarctic strains were mainly associated with the differences in lipid composition, while interspecies differences resulted from metabolomic modifications. Antarctic strains showed lower ability to survive elevated temperatures, which correlated with weaker manifestation of the lipid-dependent adaptive mechanisms compared to the Arctic strains. Among the interstrain differences, higher growth parameters and mannitol accumulation were found in the Arctic isolates. Adaptation of T. microsporus was characterized by more diverse changes in the concentrations of small organic molecules in the metabolome profile and by pronounced changes in mycelial morphology. The results of metabolomic analysis and their subsequent treatment by the methods of multivariant statistics supported the suggestion of higher dispersion of metabolomic characteristics under unfavorable conditions and of lower dispersion of metabolomic data under optimal conditions.

AB  - The exploration of extraterrestrial environments has become a focal point of scientific inquiry, driven by advancements in technology and a growing interest in the potential for life beyond Earth. This study investigates the adaptability of Antarctic nematodes, known for thriving in extreme cold and isolation, to simulated Martian (MGS-1) and Lunar (LMS-1) soils. The experiment revealed differential responses in nematode survivability to the two simulants, with Lunar soil demonstrating better adaptability compared to Martian soil. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential survivability of Antarctic nematodes on real Martian and Lunar substrates with the use of the MGS-1 and the LMS-1 under terrestrial conditions. The observed results suggest differential survival responses to Lunar (6.92 +/- 0.74) and Martian (5.58 +/- 1.91) regolith simulants and highlight the complexity of factors influencing organismal survival. Considering their crucial role in soil food webs, and their relation with nutrient cycling and carbon dioxide emissions, the observed capacity of nematodes to thrive in Martian and Lunar regoliths positions them as potential candidates to sustain human habitats, helping on the development of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems, and forming the basis for a biological life-support system to facilitate human survival in extraterrestrial environments.

AB  - In arctic tundra soil N is highly limiting, N mineralization is slow and organic N greatly exceeds inorganic N. We studied the effects of fungistatics (azoxystrobin [Quadris (R)] or propiconazole [Tilt (R)]) on the fungi isolated from ericaceous plant roots in vitro. In addition to testing the phytotoxicity of the two fungistatics we also tested their effects on growth and nitrogen uptake of an ericaceous plant (Vaccinium uliginosum) in a closed Petri plate system without root-associated fungi. Finally, to evaluate the fungistatic effects in an in vivo experiment we applied fungistatics and nitrogen isotopes to intact tundra soil cores from Toolik Lake, Alaska, and examined the ammonium-N and glycine-N use by Vaccinium vitisidaea with and without fungistatics. The experiments on fungal pure cultures showed that Tilt was more effective in reducing fungal colony growth in vitro than Quadris (R), which was highly variable among the fungal strains. Laboratory experiments aiming to test the fungistatic effects on plant performance in vitro showed that. neither Quadris (R) nor Tilt (R) affected V uliginosum growth or N uptake. In this experiment V ufiginosum assimilated more than an order of magnitude more ammonium-N than glycine-N. The intact tundra core experiment provided contrasting results. After 10 wk of fungistatic application in the growth chamber V vitis-idaea leaf %N was 10% lower and the amount of leaf N-15 acquired was reduced from labeled ammonium (33%) and glycine (40%) during the 4 d isotope treatment. In contrast to the in vitro experiment leaf N-15 assimilation from glycine was three times higher than from (NH4)-N-15 in the treatments that received no-fungistatics. We conclude that the function of the fungal communities is essential to the acquisition of N from organic sources and speculate that N acquisition from inorganic sources is mainly inhibited by competition with complex soil microbial communities.

AB  - To obtain chitinase-producing microorganisms with high chitinolytic activity at low temperature, samples collected from Fildes Peninsula in Antarctica were used as sources for bioprospecting of chitinolytic microorganisms. A cold-adapted strain, designated as GWSMS-1, was isolated from marine sediment and further characterized as Pseudomonas. To improve the chitinase production, one-factor-at-a-time and orthogonal test approaches were adopted to optimize the medium components and culture conditions. The results showed that the highest chitinolytic activity (6.36 times higher than that before optimization) was obtained with 95.41 U L-1 with 15 g L-1 of glucose, 1 g L-1 of peptone, 15 g L-1 of colloid chitin and 0.25 g L-1 of magnesium ions contained in the medium, cultivated under pH 7.0 and a temperature of 20 degrees C. To better understand the application potential of this strain, the enzymatic properties and the antifungal activity of the crude chitinase secreted by the strain were further investigated. The crude enzyme showed the maximum catalytic activity at 35 degrees C and pH 4.5, and it also exhibited excellent low-temperature activity, which still displayed more than 50% of its maximal activity at 0 degrees C. Furthermore, the crude chitinase showed significant inhibition of fungi Verticillium dahlia CICC 2534 and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum CICC 2532, which can cause cotton wilt and cucumber blight, respectively, suggesting that strain GWSMS-1 could be a competitive candidate for biological control in agriculture, especially at low temperature.

AB  - The discordant trend of plant and fungal beta-diversity suggested an ecological rule reflecting plant-fungal interaction.
   Beta-diversity partitioning has shown that the nestedness component is developed with environmental stress in a variety of taxa. However, soil fungal community may maintain its turnover components in contrast to the development of plants' nestedness component, and the potential causes remain unclear. To investigate the process of species turnover of soil fungi along a stress gradient in the Arctic, we divided species turnover component into sub-components: beta(sim_hete) and beta(sim_homo) representing species turnover with and without a change in the guilds, respectively. The results indicate that fungal communities maintain their turnover components, unlike plant communities; however, their beta(sim_hete) increased under stressful conditions. Additionally, GDM analysis showed that beta(sim_hete) was mainly explained by stress gradient and plant nestedness, suggesting that the functionality of soil fungi was ecologically filtered by environmental stress and plant community structure. The discordant trend of beta-diversity values between plant and fungi (i.e. development of plant nestedness and maintenance of fungal turnover) is possibly not caused by different assembly rules working in parallel on the two taxa, but according to an ecological rule that reflects plant-fungal interaction.

AB  - The major part of the north polar region is intensely rising by postglacial crustal movement. This process gives rise to the separation of different basins from seas and oceans, which affects a combination of freshwater and marine organisms. Gradually losing contact with the seas, many near-shore lakes of the Arctic are mostly desalted and form bogs. Fungi as decomposers play an important role in all ecosystems. However, the diversity and role of fungi in Arctic aquatic ecosystems is largely unknown. It is also not clear how the taxonomic structure of the fungal community is affected by the process of gradual desalinization and waterlogging. We investigated the diversity of filamentous culturable fungi in different parts of the brackish Kislo-Sladkoe Lake (White Sea, Russia). Annually, 42 samples of the bottom and coastal soils have been collected at the lake from which fungi were recovered on standard and selective media. Based on morphological and molecular markers, a total of 127 taxa have been identified. The fungal community appeared to be influenced by its sea origin and comprised both marine (Paradendryphiella salina, Acremonium spp.) and terrestrial soil species of Penicillium, Talaromyces, Mucor, Umbelopsis, Cladosporium, Cadophora, Sistotrema, Helotiales, Pleosporales, sphagnum moss destructors (Oidiodendron spp.) and insect-associated species of Tolypocladium. The results indicate that the composition of the fungal community in the rising polar White Sea region reflects the dynamics of global changes in physical-chemical parameters and animal and plant associations because of separation from the sea.

LA  - English
AB  - Twenty-five isolates of F. acuminatum, 38 of F. avenaceum, 1 of F. culmorum, 31 of F. oxysporum and 56 of F. sambucinum were obtained in 1983, 1984 and 1986 from cereal grains and soil from various parts of Norway. The isolates were grown on an autoclaved Uncle Ben''s parboiled rice medium and examined for production of trichothecenes and other toxins and for toxicity in rat feeding tests. F. culmorum N46C(2) and Fusarium sambucinum 45-86-A produced zearalenone (F-2) 864 and 665  ppm, respectively and caused uterine enlargement in rats. Most of these isolates produced no known trichothecene mycotoxins that could account for the toxicity that was demonstrated in the rat feeding tests. All but F. avenaceum N26B produced fusarin C (1.5 ppm) but caused no toxic effects in rat feeding test. None of the isolates produced fusarochromanone (TDP-1). Thirteen isolates of F. acuminatum, 16 o F. avenaceum, 14 of F. oxysporum and 3 of F. sambucinum produced a cytotoxic factor which we named HM-8. One isolate of F. avenaceum, 12 of F. oxysporum and 46 of F. sambucinum produced a hemorrhagic factor which we named H-1 (wortmannin). Twenty isolates of F. acuminatum, 22 of F. avenaceum, 17 of F. oxysporum and 1 of F. sambucinum produced moniliformin. Four isolates of F. acuminatum, 9 of F. avenaceum, 25 of F. oxysporum and 52 of F. sambucinum caused death to rats. Three isolates of F. avenaceum, 19 of F. oxysporum and 47 of F.  sambucinum induced hemorrhage in various organs. All isolates caused decreased weight gain, relative to the control diets.

AB  - One hundred and thirty bacterial strains, isolated from Arctic soil on the Svalbard Archipelago, were screened for biosurfactant production. Among them, an isolate identified as Pseudomonas putida BD2 was selected as a potential biosurfactant-producer based on the surface/interfacial activity of the culture supernatant. The ability of the strain to produce simultaneously phosphatidylethanolamines and rhamnolipid, using glucose as a sole carbon source, was demonstrated. The rhamnolipid Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and two homologs of phosphatidylethanolamine were extracted from cell-free supernatant of P. putida BD2 culture with ethyl acetate and identified by UPLC-MS analysis. For Rha-Rha-C10-C10 the surface tension decreased from 72 to 31 mN/m and the critical micelle concentration was 0.130 mg/mL. The Rha-Rha-C10-C10 was able to form stable aggregates (80-121 nm). Pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/mL rhamnolipid inhibited bacterial adhesion by 43-79% and that of the pathogenic fungal species C. albi cans by 89-90%. The same concentration of phosphatidylethanolamines inhibited bacterial adhesion by 23-72% and that of C. albicans by 96-98%. To our knowledge, this is the first report where one type rhamnolipid and two homologs of phospholipid biosurfactants were produced by P. putida isolated from Arctic soil. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fungi and bacteria number, as well as the species composition of the fungi in the ground air layer in the European Arctic region of Russia, primarily in the tundra (the Rybachy Peninsula), in the subzone of the northern taiga (the Pasvik State Nature Reserve) and in the industrial areas (the Copper-Nickel Plant Pechenganickel, the Kandalaksha Aluminum Plant) have been studied. One hundred and ninety-two atmosphere air samples of various ecosystems have been analyzed. The sample collection took place in the summer-autumn period (June, July, September, in 2012-2015) with the aspirator, precipitating microorganisms on the surface of media. The number of microorganisms per 1m(3) of air was calculated. The portion of the airborne fungi in the ground air layer both in the tundra and in the taiga was higher in comparison with the bacteria, and amounted to 60-77% of the total number colony forming units (CFU). The least number of microorganisms in the investigated period was registered in the Barents Sea coastal atmospheric air, only 11-15 microbial CFU per 1m(3). The airborne fungi diversity in the taiga zone was richer than in the tundra. The fungi of the g. Penicillium predominated in both zones air. Bacteria gram-positive (the division Fermicutes) predominated within the bacterial biota. The species Penicillium decumbens, P. raistrickii prevailed in the air of the background tundra zone regions. The representatives of the genus Torula and Sterilia mycelia, P. raistrickii predominated in the taiga zone. Close by the Copper-Nickel Plant (about 3km), the air bacterial contamination (100-600 CFU per 1m(3)) was revealed, with prevailing bacteria gram-negative (the division Gracilicutes). The species Cladosporium oxysporum predominated in the air to the greatest possible extent of the contaminated region due to the emissions of the Kandalaksha Aluminum Plant. The species Gongronella butleri were uppermost due to the emissions of the Copper-Nickel Plant << Pechenganickel >>. The quantity of the dark-pigmented fungi in the air for both zones amounted to 25% of the total amount within the emphasized species. The composition of the air industrial emissions stimulated the development of specific airborne fungi which are essentially different from those of the background regions.

AB  - Seven new pimarane-type diterpene derivatives, libertellenones O-S (1-5) and eutypellenones A and B (6 and 7), together with two known compounds (8 and 9), were isolated from the culture of Eutypella sp. D-1 obtained from high-latitude soil of the Arctic. Their structures were elucidated from spectroscopic data, as well as experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) analysis. Structurally, compounds 1-5 possess a cyclopropyl-fused pimarane diterpene moiety, whereas compounds 6 and 7 share an unusual cyclobutyl-fused pimarane diterpene skeleton. Compounds 1-9 exhibited cytotoxicities against HeLa, MCF-7, HCT-116, PANC-1, and SW1990 cells, with IC50 values in the range of 0.3 to 29.4 mu M. Compounds 6 and 7 could dose-dependently inhibit the activity of NF-kappa B and exhibited significantly inhibitory effects on nitric oxide production induced by lipopolysaccharide.

AB  - During the characterization of the mycobiota associated with shallow-water marine environments from Antarctic sea, a novel pink yeast species was isolated. Sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rDNA gene and 5.8S-ITS regions revealed that the isolated yeast was closely related to Rhodotorula pallida CBS 320(T) and Rhodotorula benthica CBS 9124(T). On the basis of morphological, biochemical and physiological characterization and phylogenetic analyses, a novel basidiomycetous yeast species, Rhodotorula portillonensis sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is Pi2(T) (=CBS 12733(T) =CECT 13081(T)) which was isolated from shallow-water marine sediment in Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica.

AB  - The unusually harsh environmental conditions of terrestrial Antarctic habitats result in ecosystems with simplified trophic structures, where microbial processes are especially dominant as drivers of soil-borne nutrient cycling. We examined soil-borne Antarctic communities (bacteria, fungi and nematodes) at five locations along a southern latitudinal gradient from the Falkland Islands (51 degrees S) to the base of the Antarctic Peninsula (72 degrees S), and compared principally vegetated vs. fell-field locations at three of these sites. Results of molecular (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR), biochemical (ergosterol, phospholipid fatty acids) and traditional microbiological (temperature- and medium-related CFU) analyses were related to key soil and environmental properties. Microbial abundance generally showed a significant positive relationship with vegetation and vegetation-associated soil factors (e.g. water content, organic C, total N). Microbial community structure was mainly related to latitude or location and latitude-dependent factors (e.g. mean temperature, NO3, pH). Furthermore, strong interactions between vegetation cover and location were observed, with the effects of vegetation cover being most pronounced in more extreme sites. These results provide insight into the main drivers of microbial community size and structure across a range of terrestrial Antarctic and sub-Antarctic habitats, potentially serving as a useful baseline to study the impact of predicted global warming on these unique and pristine ecosystems.

AB  - Feeding habits of 25 spp. of oribatids from the North America arctic and subarctic were determined by gut content analysis. Over 50% are panphytophages, a feeding habit considered to be ecologically advantageous, in that a particular species can survive in many different habitats. Microphytophagous species (11) were recorded, predominantly from the Damaeoidea, Eremaeoidea and Oppioidea. Individuals of 11 spp. of Oribatei were plated to examine the importance of mites in disseminating fungi. Fungal species (20) were identified from colonies growing on approximately 60% of the plates. Most of the isolated fungi have a world-wide distribution, occurring in soils from tropical to arctic regions. Fecal pellets from 7 spp. were also plated. Fungal colonies grew from only 14% of these pellets which may be a result of the feeding habits of the species examined. Most species being panphytophagous, the amount of fungal material in their gut would vary from meal to meal. The direct and indirect effects of oribatid mites on decomposition within the soil ecosystem is discussed.

AB  - A new species, Phalansterium arcticum sp. n., was isolated from an 8580-year-old Arctic permafrost layer. This organism typically lives as a sedentary uniflagellated cell enclosed in a thin flexible mucilaginous sheath, but can form naked swimming cells and amoeboid cells with eruptive pseudopodia accompanied with the formation of short, filopodia-like projections. In an SSU rDNA phylogenetic tree, it robustly groups with other species of this genus. Along with a description of the species, we also add new details to the description of the cell division of Phalansterium and the feeding process in this organism. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Microorganisms that inhabit the cold Antarctic environment can produce ligninolytic enzymes potentially useful in bioremediation. Our study focused on characterizing Antarctic bacteria and fungi from marine sediment samples of King George and Deception Islands, maritime Antarctica, potentially affected by hydrocarbon influence, able to produce enzymes for use in bioremediation processes in environments impacted with petroleum derivatives. A total of 168 microorganism isolates were obtained: 56 from sediments of King George Island and 112 from Deception Island. Among them, five bacterial isolates were tolerant to cell growth in the presence of diesel oil and gasoline and seven fungal were able to discolor RBBR dye. In addition, 16 isolates (15 bacterial and one fungal) displayed enzymatic emulsifying activities. Two isolates were characterized taxonomically by showing better biotechnological results. Psychrobacter sp. BAD17 and Cladosporium sp. FAR18 showed pyrene tolerance (cell growth of 0.03 g mL-1 and 0.2 g mL-1) and laccase enzymatic activity (0.006 UL-1 and 0.10 UL-1), respectively. Our results indicate that bacteria and fungi living in sediments under potential effect of hydrocarbon pollution may represent a promising alternative to bioremediate cold environments contaminated with polluting compounds derived from petroleum such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dyes.

AB  - Dramatic increases in air temperature and precipitation are occurring in the High Arctic (>70 degrees N), yet few studies have characterized the long-term responses of High Arctic ecosystems to the interactive effects of experimental warming and increased rain. Beginning in 2003, we applied a factorial summer warming and wetting experiment to a polar semidesert in northwest Greenland. In summer 2018, we assessed several metrics of ecosystem structure and function, including plant cover, greenness, ecosystem CO2 exchange, aboveground (leaf, stem) and belowground (litter, root, soil) carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations (%) and pools, as well as leaf and soil stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Wetting induced the most pronounced changes in ecosystem structure, accelerating the expansion of Salix arctica cover by 370% and increasing aboveground C, N, and biomass pools by 94%-101% and root C, N, and biomass pools by 60%-122%, increases which coincided with enhanced net ecosystem CO2 uptake. Further, wetting combined with warming enhanced plot-level greenness, whereas in isolation neither wetting nor warming had an effect. At the plant level, the effects of warming and wetting differed among species and included warming-linked decreases in leaf N and delta N-15 in S. arctica, whereas leaf N and delta N-15 in Dryas integrifolia did not respond to the climate treatments. Finally, neither plant- nor plot-level C and N allocation patterns nor soil C, N, delta C-13, or delta N-15 concentrations changed in response to our manipulations, indicating that these ecosystem metrics may resist climate change, even in the longer term. In sum, our results highlight the importance of summer precipitation in regulating ecosystem structure and function in arid parts of the High Arctic, but they do not completely refute previous findings of resistance in some High Arctic ecosystem properties to climate change.

AB  - P>Climate change in cold biomes not only involves higher summer temperatures, but also warmer springs and more winter precipitation. So far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal components of climate change.
   We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the responses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia, the deciduous dwarf shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus.
   We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios) going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to N-limited plant growth.
   The natural abundance of N-15 varied very strongly among species and growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms, but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5 parts per thousand). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen shrubs < deciduous shrubs.
   After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming effects.
   This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of these climate changes.

AB  - Antarctica harbors a microbial diversity still poorly explored and of inestimable biotechnological value. Cold-adapted microorganisms can produce a diverse range of metabolites stable at low temperatures, making these compounds industrially interesting for biotechnological use. The present work investigated the biotechnological potential for antimicrobial and antitumor activity of filamentous fungi and bacteria isolated from marine sediment samples collected at Deception Island, Antarctica. A total of 89 microbial isolates were recovered from marine sediments and submitted to an initial screening for l-glutaminase with antitumoral activity and for antimicrobial metabolites. The isolates Pseudogymnoascus sp. FDG01, Pseudogymnoascus sp. FDG02, and Penicillium sp. FAD33 showed potential antiproliferative action against human pancreatic carcinoma cells while showing no toxic effect on non-tumor cells. The microbial extracts from unidentified three bacteria and four filamentous fungi showed antibacterial activity against at least one tested pathogenic bacterial strain. The isolate FDG01 inhibited four bacterial species, while the isolate FDG01 was active against Micrococcus luteus in the minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.015625 mu g mL -1. The results pave the way for further optimization of enzyme production and characterization of enzymes and metabolites found and reaffirm Antarctic marine environments as a wealthy source of compounds potentially applicable in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.

AB  - This review summarizes research concerning Antarctic fungi at the century-old historic huts of the Heroic Period of exploration in the Ross Dependency 1898-1917 and fungi in pristine terrestrial locations. The motivation of the research was initially to identify potential fungal causes of degradation of the historic huts and artifacts. The research was extended to study fungal presence at pristine sites for comparison purposes and to consider the role of fungi in the respective ecosystems. We employed classical microbiology for isolation of viable organisms, and culture-independent DNA analyses. The research provided baseline data on microbial biodiversity. Principal findings were that there is significant overlap of the yeasts and filamentous fungi isolated from the historic sites, soil, and historic-introduced materials (i.e., wood, foodstuffs) and isolated from environmental samples in pristine locations. Aerial spore monitoring confirmed that winter spore counts were high and, in some cases, similar to those found in summer. Microbial diversity varied between the three Ross Island historic sites, and one historic site showed noticeably higher diversity, which led to the conclusion that this is a variable that should not be generalized. Cultured fungi were cold active, and the broader scientific significance of this finding was that climate change (warming) may not adversely affect these fungal species unless they were out-competed by new arrivals or unfavorable changes in ecosystem domination occur.

AB  - We introduced a novel combination of chromatographic techniques for the purification and analysis of a new UV-sunscreen mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) in the terrestrial green alga Prasiola calophylla.
   Prasiola calophylla (Carmichael ex Greville) Kutzing (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) is a typical member of terrestrial algal communities in temperate Europe, where it regularly experiences various stress conditions including strong diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in ultraviolet radiation (UVR). As a photoprotective mechanism Prasiola species and other related Trebouxiophycean taxa synthesize a mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) as natural sunscreen whose chemical structure was unknown so far. In the present study a new methodological approach is described for the isolation, purification and structural elucidation of this novel sunscreen in P. calophylla. The new compound exhibits an absorption maximum at 324 nm (in the short ultraviolet-A), a molecular weight of 333 and a molecular extinction coefficient of 12.393 M-1 cm(-1), and could be identified as N-[5,6 hydroxy-5(hydroxymethyl)-2-methoxy-3-oxo-1-cycohexen-1-yl] glutamic acid using one- and two-dimensional H-1 and C-13-NMR spectroscopy. As trivial name for this novel MAA we suggest 'prasiolin'. The ecologically essential function of prasiolin for UVR-protection in terrestrial algae of the Trebouxiophyceae is discussed.

AB  - As a part of a large-scale biogeographical study we examined the evolutionary relationships and taxonomic position of Marasmius epidryas, one of the most typical circumpolar arctic-alpine fungi, characterized by a specific, saprobic affinity to dead tissues of Dryas spp. A phylogenetic analysis based on nLSU and RPB2 DNA regions unequivocally indicated the phylogenetic placement of this species within the Physalacriaceae. The Bayesian MCMCMC analysis as well as other inference methods tested (ML, NJ) revealed a well supported affinity of M. epidryas to Rhizomarasmius pyrrhocephalus, type species of a recently circumscribed genus, Rhizomarasmius. As a consequence, based on these results, we introduce a new combination, Rhizomarasmius epidryas (Kuhner ex A. Ronikier) A. Ronikier and M. Ronikier. Thus our results demonstrate that neither the traditional taxonomic placement of the fungus in genus Marasmius nor the recent transfer into genus Mycetinis are phylogenetically correct. In contrast they support the importance of the third lineage of the polyphyletic Marasmius s. l., having evolutionary links with taxa forming the Physalacriaceae clade of agaricoid fungi. In addition the lineage of Rhizomarasmius was confirmed to be closely related to the representatives of Gloiocephala, comprising small, often narrowly specialized saprobic species previously also classified within Marasmius s. l.

AB  - Fungi are highly diverse, yet only a minor part of the total estimated species has been cultured and characterized. This might be especially true for Arctic, where studies on the fungal diversity are still scarce. For that reason, our aim was to analyze fungal diversity in the droppings of Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus. The samples of feces from 32 adult individuals were collected in the southern or central parts of the Wedel Jarlsberg Land (Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago) and assessed for micromycetes diversity using a combination of classical and molecular identification approaches. We found 16 fungal species, out of which three were described as mesophilic, two as psychrotolerant and eleven as psychrophilic. The identified Arctic fungi belonged to eleven genera out of which representatives of Naganishia genus (formerly belonging to Cryptococcus albidus clade) were the most abundant fungal species isolated. Additionally, to our knowledge, we firstly recorded Botrytis cinerea in polar areas. We conclude that droppings of R. tarandus platyrhynchus are a source of different fungal taxa, including fungi potentially pathogenic towards humans, plants and insects.

AB  - A total of 331 aerobic heterotrophic bacterial strains were isolated from various ecosystems of Finnish Lapland (68-69 degrees N) including forest soil, arctic alpine-tundra soil, stream water, lake and mire sediments, lichen and snow algae. Whole cell fatty acid and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and microscopy indicated that the isolates were dominated by Gram-negative bacteria, while only 20 Gram-positive strains were isolated. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences the isolates were members of alpha-, beta-, gamma-Proteobacteria, Gram-positives with low G+C content, Actinobacteria and the Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides group. More than one-third of the isolates could be tentatively identified as Pseudomonas spp. which were particularly abundant in the alpine-tundra soils where they represented 60% of all isolates. Other frequently isolated Gram-negative taxa were Burkholderia sp., Collimonas sp., Pedobacter sp., Janthinobacter sp., Duganella sp., Dyella sp. and Sphingomonas sp. Growth temperature ranges and hydrolytic enzyme activities of selected ca. 100 strains were screened. The strains were psychrotolerant growing generally at temperatures ranging from 0 to 30 degrees C, as 82% of the isolates grew at 0 degrees C while only 7% grew at 35 degrees C. Protease and lipase activities at 5 degrees C were detected in more than half of the strains while approximately 20% of the strains possessed amylase and/or cellulase activities.

AB  - Antarctic environments are characterized by polar climate, making it difficult for the development of any form of life. The biogeochemical cycles and food web in such restrictive environments may be exclusively formed by microorganisms. Polar mycological studies are recent and there is much to know about the diversity and genetic resources of these microorganisms. In this sense, the molecular taxonomic approach was applied to identify 129 fungal isolates from marine and terrestrial samples collected from the King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctic). Additionally, the production of cold-adapted enzymes by these microorganisms was evaluated. Among the 129 isolates, 69.0% were identified by ITS-sequencing and affiliated into 12 genera. Cadophora, Geomyces, Penicillium, Cosmospora, and Cladosporium were the most abundant genera. Representatives of Cosmospora were isolated only from terrestrial samples, while representatives of the others genera were recovered from marine and terrestrial samples. A total of 29, 19, and 74 isolates were able to produce ligninolytic enzymes, xylanase, and l-asparaginase, respectively. Representatives of Cadophora showed great ability to produce lignin peroxidase (LiP) and laccase at 15.0 degrees C in liquid medium, while representatives of Penicillium and non-identified fungi were the best producers of xylanase and l-asparaginase at 20.0 degrees C. The high number of fungi able to produce enzymes at moderate temperature reveals their potential for industrial production and biotechnological applications. The present study broadens the knowledge of fungal diversity associated with the southern polar region. Additionally, data from molecular taxonomy suggest that two filamentous fungi may be considered as potential new species.

AB  - Resin acids are tricyclic terpenoids occurring naturally in trees. We investigated the occurrence of resin acid-degrading bacteria on the Arctic tundra near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island (82 degreesN, 62 degreesW). According to most-probable-number assays, resin acid degraders were abundant (10(3) to 10(4) propagules/g of soil) in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, but they were undetectable (<3 propagules/g of soil) in pristine soils from the nearby tundra, Plate counts indicated that the contaminated and the pristine soils had similar populations of heterotrophs (10(6) to 10(7) propagules/g of soil). Eleven resin acid-degrading bacteria belonging to four phylogenetically distinct groups were enriched and isolated from the contaminated soils, and representative isolates of each group were further characterized. Strains DhA-91, IpA-92, and IpA-93 are members of the genus Pseudomonas, Strain DhA-95 is a member of the genus Sphingomonas, All four strains are psychrotolerant, with growth temperature ranges of 4<degrees>C to 30 degreesC (DhA-91 and DhA-95) or 4 degreesC to 22 degreesC (IpA-92 and IpA-93) and with optimum temperatures of 15 to 22 degreesC. Strains DhA-91 and DhA-95 grew on the abietanes, dehydroabietic and abietic acids, but not on the pimaranes, isopimaric and pimaric acids. Strains IpA-92 and IpA-93 grew on the pimaranes but not the abietanes, All four strains grew on either aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, which is unusual for described resin acid degraders. Eleven mesophilic resin acid degraders did not use hydrocarbons, with the exception of two Mycobacterium sp, strains that used aliphatic hydrocarbons. We conclude that hydrocarbon contamination in Arctic tundra soil indirectly selected for resin acid degraders, selecting for hydrocarbon degraders that coincidentally use resin acids. Psychrotolerant resin acid degraders are likely important in the global carbon cycle and may have applications in biotreatment of pulp and paper mill effluents.

AB  - Two new cyclopiane diterpenes and a new cladosporin precursor, together with four known related compounds, were isolated from the marine sediment-derived fungus Penicillium antarcticum KMM 4670, which was re-identified based on phylogenetic inference from ITS, BenA, CaM, and RPB2 gene regions. The absolute stereostructures of the isolated cyclopianes were determined using modified Mosher's method and quantum chemical calculations of the ECD spectra. The isolation from the natural source of two biosynthetic precursors of cladosporin from a natural source has been reported for the first time. The antimicrobial activities of the isolated compounds against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans as well as the inhibition of staphylococcal sortase A activity were investigated. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the compounds to mammalian cardiomyocytes H9c2 was studied. As a result, new cyclopiane diterpene 13-epi-conidiogenone F was found to be a sortase A inhibitor and a promising anti-staphylococcal agent.

AB  - Almost all of the investigated samples of the Arctic and Antarctic permafrost sediments of different genesis with ages from 5-10 thousand to 2-3 million years were found to contain viable micromycete and bacterial cells. The maximum amounts of viable cells of fungi (up to 10(4) CFU/g air-dried sample) and bacteria (up to 10(7)-10(9) CFU/g air-dried sample) were present in fine peaty sediment samples taken from different depths. The identified micromycetes belonged to more than 20 genera of the divisions Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota, and some represented mitosporic fungi. Thawing the samples at 35 and 52 degreesC allowed the number of detected fungal genera to be increased by more than 30%. Aerobic heterotrophic prokaryotes were dominated by coryneform, nocardioform, and spore-forming microorganisms of the order Actinomycetales. Analysis of the isolated fungi and actinomycetes showed that most of them originated from the microbial communities of ancient terrestrial biocenoses.

A total of 58 fungal strains were isolated and classified into 14 species (Cryptococcus gilvescens, Cryptococcus victoriae, Mrakia gelida, Mrakia robertii, Mrakia psychrophila, Rhodotorula glacialis, Rhodotorula psychrophenolica, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Thelebolus microsporus, Mortierella alpina, Mortierella polygonia, Mortierella elongata, Mortierella horticola, and Mucor hiemalis). We showed that the mycoflora clearly changes with distance from the glacier terminus in Austre Broggerbreen deglaciation area. (C) 2016 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim To screen and identify a potential biosurfactant-producing yeast strain isolated from Antarctic soil and to evaluate the fermentation process kinetics of the most promising strain on biosurfactant production using glycerol as carbon source. Methods and Results From the 68 isolated yeast strains, 11 strains were able to produce biosurfactants after Emulsification Index (E.I.) and Drop Collapse tests, reaching an E.I. higher than 10%. Strain 1_4.0 was the best producer, identified as Candida glaebosa based on molecular analysis. Yeast was cultivated in a medium composed of glycerol supplemented with yeast extract for 120 h to determine the process kinetics. The increased C/N ratio affected yeast growth and biosurfactant production. Biosurfactant release was associated with the end of exponential and beginning of the stationary growth phases. Results indicated an E.I. of 30% at the end of the fermentation. Conclusions The feasiability of C. glaebosa to produce biosurfactant from a low-cost medium cultivation shows a great impact on the development of bioresource in the Antarctica terrestrial environment. Significance and Impact of the Study Although the diversity of psychrophilic/psychrotolerant micro-organisms from Antarctica has been the preferred subject of study by microbiologists, terrestrial microfungal communities are scarcely investigated and literature about the biotechnological potential of such micro-organisms should cover important biomolecules in addition to cold-adapted enzymes. In the present study, for the first time, the Maritime Antarctica environment was screened as a novel source of biosurfactants produced by micro-organisms.

AB  - Ninety one streptomycetes strains were isolated from permafrost soil in Spitsbergen, Arctic Ocean. Five of them showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The strains were psychrotolerant with growth at temperatures between 4 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Morphological, physiological and biochemical characterizations were investigated and the starins could be affiliated to the same genus. Antibiotic production of the strains was investigated at 4 degrees C and the active compouds were isolated from the culture filtrate. Strong activity of the isolated compounds against bacteria, yeast and fungi was detected.

AB  - Despite adverse conditions in Antarctica for life, organic materials can be successfully colonized by extremophilic microorganisms. This work describes the isolation of filamentous fungi from terrestrial and maritime habitats of King George Island, Antarctica, and the screening of their ability to produce antimicrobial compounds. A total of 44 samples were collected during the Antarctic expeditions from soil, sediments, terrestrial and marine waters and pieces of wood that had been brought into Antarctica. One hundred thirty-seven psychrotrophic fungi were isolated. Thirty-three strains selected from different samples and with different morphological characteristics were used in molecular identification and antimicrobial activity assays. The ability of all isolations to inhibit growth of different bacteria in vitro was tested using the agar plug diffusion method.
   Most of the fungi identified were Ascomycota with only a few Zygomycota and no Basidiomycota isolated. Twenty-six cultures corresponded to known species. Penicillium was the most represented genus of identified fungal isolations (24 %) followed by species of Cadophora, Mortierella, Pseudogymnoascus and Neurospora. This is the first report of the presence of Aspergillus pseudodeflectus in this region. Of the isolates under study, eighteen were able to inhibit growth of at least one of the bacterial strains used.

AB  - Metabolites isolated from Penicillium palitans, obtained from deep sea sediments in the maritime Antarctica, were investigated for phytotoxic and antifungal activities. The fungus was submitted to solid state fermentation, and its crude extract was produced. Chromatographic separations of the P. palitans methylene chloride crude extract led to the isolation of two analogous compounds: (-)-penienone (1) and (-)-palitantin (2). The phytotoxic activity of these compounds was assessed against seeds of Lactuca sativa and Agrostis stolonifera. Both compounds demonstrated activity exclusively in the monocotyledonous model, A. stolonifera. At a concentration of 1 mg mL-1, (-)-penienone caused 100 % inhibition of seed germination, while (-)-palitantin had only moderate activity on germination and growth of seedlings at this concentration after 7 days of treatment. Against Lemna paucicostata, at 57 mu M, (-)-penienone inhibited growth by 50 % (IC50). (-)-Palitantin was much less active. When evaluated for their antifungal activity against Colletotrichum fragariae, only (-)-penienone had an IC50 value of 0.3 mu M. The strain P. palitans was shown to be a promising source of phytotoxic and antifungal compounds, suggesting that extremophilic fungi, such as wild Penicillium strains from Antarctica, have the potential to yield novel prototype molecules for new pesticide development.

AB  - Cold-adapted microorganisms can produce enzymes with activity at low and mild temperatures, which can be applied to environmental biotechnology. This study aimed to characterize 20 Antarctic fungi to identify their genus (ITS rDNA marker) and growth temperatures and evaluate their ability to decolorize and detoxify the textile dye indigo carmine (IC). An individual screening was performed to assess the decolorization and detoxification of IC by the isolates, as well as in consortia with other fungi. The isolates were affiliated with seven ascomycete genera: Aspergillus (n = 4), Cosmospora (n = 2), Leuconeurospora (n = 2), Penicillium (n = 3), Pseudogymnoascus (n = 6), Thelebolus (n = 2), and Trichoderma (n = 1). The two isolates from the genus Leuconeurospora were characterized as psychrophilic, while the others were psychrotolerant. The Penicillium isolates were able to decolorize between 60 and 82% of IC. The isolates identified as Pseudogymnoascus showed the best detoxification capacity, with results varying from 49 to 74%. The consortium using only Antarctic ascomycetes (C1) showed 45% of decolorization, while the consortia with the addition of basidiomycetes (C1 + Peniophora and C1 + Pholiota) showed 40% and 50%, respectively. The consortia C1 with the addition of the basidiomycetes presented a lower toxicity after the treatments. In addition, a higher fungal biomass was produced in the presence of dye when compared with the experiment without the dye, which can be indicative of dye metabolization. The results highlight the potential of marine-derived Antarctic fungi in the process of textile dye degradation. The findings encourage further studies to elucidate the degradation and detoxification pathways of the dye IC by these fungal isolates.

AB  - We quantified the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of fungi associated with dead moss tissues and conifer needles in a forest-tundra ecotone in a sub-Arctic region, Quebec, Canada. We detected 615 operational taxonomic units, in total, of fungi in 84 families with 97% sequence similarity by metabarcoding the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Saprotrophs were the dominant functional guild. The results indicated the effects of host plant species and local environmental heterogeneity on fungal diversity in the cold region. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity indices of fungal communities were significantly greater in moss than in conifers. The greater phylogenetic diversity in moss was mainly attributable to the presence of families in Mucoromycota, compared to those in conifers, in which relatively closely related families of Dikarya were present. The taxonomic diversity was also related to local variations in vegetation and soil properties, suggesting that the local colonization and establishment of vegetation and the concomitant development of soil contributed to the taxonomic diversity of fungi. In contrast, functional diversity was not significantly affected by the host, vegetation, or soil properties, indicating that the fungal community members were relatively redundant in terms of the evaluated functional traits.

AB  - In order to determine their tolerance to pesticides, 122 strains of rhizobia isolated from different geographical regions, and belonging to the genera Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium were tested against eight herbicides, four fungicides and five insecticides. Sensitivity to the pesticides was measured by using the filter paper disk method at four concentrations, 0.45, 4.5, 45 and 450 mu g per disk. When the pesticides were used at 0.45 mu g per disk, a concentration similar to that found when pesticides are applied under field conditions, no inhibition was observed. Strains growth was affected at concentrations of 45 and 450 mu g pesticide per disk. These higher concentrations can be encountered when seeds are treated with pesticides. Pesticides tolerance level was correlated to pesticide function, i.e rhizobial strains were more tolerant to insecticides, followed by herbicides and then fungicides. Two fungicides, captan and mancozeb, inhibited the highest number of strains. Only one insecticide, carbaryl, affected the growth of some rhizobial strains. Strains isolated from the arctic (Mesorhizobium spp. and R. leguminosarum bv. viciae), a putative pesticides-free environment, were either less or equally affected by pesticides compared to strains isolated from agricultural regions.

AB  - Background Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) belong to the class of glycolipid biosurfactants and are produced by members of the Ustilago and Moesziomyces genera. Production of MELs is regulated by a biosynthetic gene cluster (MEL BGC). Extracellular lipase activity is also associated with MEL production. Most microbial glycolipid-producers are isolated from oil-contaminated environments. MEL-producing yeast that are capable of metabolizing crude oil are understudied, and there is very limited data on indigenous strains from tropical climates. Analysis of the MEL BGC and lipase genes in Trinidad M. antarcticus strains, using a gene-targeted approach, revealed a correlation between their intrinsic capability to degrade crude oil and their adaptation to survive in a chronically polluted terrestrial environment. Results M. antarcticus was isolated from naturally-occurring crude oil seeps and an asphaltic mud volcano in Trinidad; these are habitats that have not been previously reported for this species. Genus identification was confirmed by the large-subunit (LSU) and the small-subunit (SSU) sequence comparisons and species identification was confirmed by ITS sequence comparisons and phylogenetic inference. The essential genes (Emt1, Mac1, Mac2, Mmf1) of the MEL BGC were detected with gene-specific primers. Emt1p, Mac1p and Mmf1p sequence analyses confirmed that the Trinidad strains harboured novel synonymous amino acid (aa) substitutions and structural comparisons revealed different regions of disorder, specifically for the Emt1p sequence. Functionality of each protein sequence was confirmed through motif mining and mutation prediction. Phylogenetic relatedness was inferred for Emt1p, Mac1p and Mmf1p sequences. The Trinidad strains clustered with other M. antarcticus sequences, however, the representative Trinidad M. antarcticus sequences consistently formed a separate, highly supported branch for each protein. Similar phylogenetic placement was indicated for LipA and LipB nucleotide and protein sequences. The Trinidad strains also demonstrated lipolytic activity in culture, with an ability to utilize different carbon sources. Comparative evolution of MEL BGC and LipA gene suggested early and late duplication events, depending on the gene, followed by a number of speciation events within Ustilaginaceae. M. antarcticus and M. aphidis were separated from all other members of Ustilaginaceae and two gene homologues were detected, one for each species. Conclusions Sequence analyses was based on a novel gene-targeted approach to analyze the essential genes of the MEL BGC and LipA and LipB genes of M. antarcticus strains from Trinidad. The findings indicated that these strains accumulated nucleotide mutations to a threshold level that did not affect the function of specific proteins encoded by the MEL BGC and LipA and LipB genes. The biosurfactant and lipase enzymes secreted by these Trinidad M. antarcticus strains facilitated their survival in oil-contaminated terrestrial environments. These findings suggest that the Trinidad strains should be explored as promising candidates for the commercial production of MEL biosurfactants and lipase enzymes.

AB  - Antarctica has one of the most hostile conditions on the planet. The environmental characteristics found in this region favor the development of extremophile microorganisms, which are poorly explored biotechnologically. In this context, this study aimed at selectively isolating fungi with potential for the bioremediation of a textile dye. A total of 11 filamentous fungi were isolated from Antarctic samples after incubation in Minimal Mineral medium with the addition of Sulphur Indigo Blue dye. The Antarctic-derived fungi were submitted to textile dye decolorization analysis and biomass production. Isolates LAMAI 2400 and LAMAI 2402 showed more than 90% of decolorization at 15 degrees C, whereas at 28 degrees C these isolates showed 81.86 and 98.89%, respectively. In general, the toxicity of the bioassays, evaluated using Cucumis sativus, was higher than in the control. Both isolates, LAMAI 2400 and LAMAI 2402, were identified as Penicillium cf oxalicum and classified as mesophilic-psychrotolerant. This fungal species has rarely been reported in the Antarctic environments. The results presented herein indicate the potential of the fungi recovered from Antarctic marine sediments for bioremediation of textile dyes at low and moderate temperatures, broadening the perspectives in the field of Antarctic mycology.

AB  - Utilization of industrial side streams as nutrient source for cellular agriculture is a promising option to improve the sustainability of the production processes. The aim of the study was to evaluate usability of two liquid food industry side streams, potato cell fluid and acid whey, as nutrient source for production of food ingredients with plant cell cultures (arctic bramble (Rubus arcticus L.) and tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum L.)) and filamentous fungi (Paecilomyces variotii, Rhizopus oligosporus and Trichoderma reesei). The side streams were found to contain various sugars and other potential nutrients suitable for the studied organisms. The side streams were used as a sole nutrient source (fungi) or as a replacement of selected nutrients in the growth media (fungi and plant cells) in flask scale cultivations. Acid whey was successfully used as a growth medium for filamentous fungi, but it inhibited plant cell growth presumably due to high organic acid content (14 g/l). Potato side stream was found suitable as a fungal and plant cell growth media supplement, and it was used together with glucose for filamentous fungi, or as a partial replacer of macronutrients for plant cells, in bioreactor cultivations yielding high fungal (up to 36 g/l dry weight) and good plant cell (9.5 g/l dry weight) biomass production. Analyses of the produced biomasses revealed good nutritional value in terms of amino acid (17-27 % of dry matter) and dietary fiber (23-30 % of dry matter) contents, giving good premises for utilization in human nutrition.

AB  - A study of the fungal flora of soils, plant leaves and litter was undertaken on the Truelove Lowland, on the north coast of Devon Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. A total of 53 taxa from 33 genera were identified, 27 from leaves and litter and 46 from soil, using soil-washing and plating as isolation methods. The predominant fungi on leaves and litter of Carex stans and Dryas integrifolia were sterile fungi, associated with Cladosporium, Phoma herbarum, Penicillium spp. and yeasts. Sterile fungi, Penicillium spp. and Chrysosporium pannorum were predominant in raised beach soils, whereas a new species of Cylindrocarpon (not ascribed here), a sterile fungi, Penicillium and Aspergillus species predominated in meadow soils. Use of direct observation methods showed that fungal biomass in meadow soils was much higher than in raised beach soils. In raised beach soils fungal biomass was heavily influenced by the distribution of cushion plants. In comparison with other tundra regions, the Truelove Lowland appears to have a moderately rich mycoflora, containing taxa common both in temperate regions and in other tundra soils. Total fungal biomass in Truelove Lowland soils was low in comparison with many tundra regions.

AB  - Over the last decades, the Antarctic regions have been investigated mainly for the presence and exploitation of psychrophilic bacteria and archea, occasionally for algae and more rarely for fungi. The present study reports results concerning the isolation and identification of filamentous fungi from samples of soil taken from Livingston Island, South Shetland Archipelago, West Antarctica. Using conventional media and techniques, all collection sites yielded populations of filamentous fungi, belonging to the phylum Ascomycota (7 genera), Deuteromycota (2), Zygomycota (2) and Basidiomycota (1). Mucor, Cladosporium, Alternaria, Aspergillus and Penicillium were predominant genera. Lecanicillium, Botrytis, Geomyces, Monodictys and Rhizopus were the most frequently isolated genera. Most of the fungal isolates proved to be cold-tolerant

AB  - Lichens as symbiotic associations consisting of a fungus (the mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont) dominate the terrestrial vegetation of continental Antarctica. The photobiont provides carbon nutrition for the fungus. Therefore, performance and protection of photosystem II is a key factor of lichen survival. Potentials and limitations of photobiont physiology require intense investigation to extend the knowledge on adaptation mechanisms in the lichen symbiosis and to clarify to which extent photobionts benefit from symbiosis. Isolated photobionts and entire lichen thalli have been examined. The contribution of the photobiont concerning adaptation mechanisms to the light regime and temperature conditions was examined by chlorophyll a fluorescence and pigment analysis focusing on the foliose lichen Umbilicaria decussata from North Victoria Land, continental Antarctica. No photoinhibition has been observed in the entire lichen thallus. In the isolated photobionts, photoinhibition was clearly temperature dependent. For the first time, melanin in U. decussata thalli has been proved. Though the isolated photobiont is capable of excess light protection, the results clearly show that photoprotection is significantly increased in the symbiotic state. The closely related photobiont of Pleopsidium chlorophanum, a lichen lacking melanin, showed a higher potential of carotenoid-based excess light tolerance. This fact discriminates the two photobionts of the same Trebouxia clade. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the successful adaptation of lichens to continental Antarctic conditions is in part based on the physiological potential of the photobionts. The findings provide information on the success of symbiotic life in extreme environments.

AB  - Sequence data from a broad geographical region and different habitats show that the Inocybe praetervisa clade is comprised of four closely related species. These species of section Marginatae are characterized by having nodulose spores and a stipe that is abundantly pruinose only in the upper half. Inocybe praetervisa occurs in Southern Europe in mountainous mixed coniferous forests, and is not confirmed from Northern Europe. Inocybe rivularis occurs in northern boreal forests up to the lower alpine zone, associated with Betula in moist habitats, and is not confirmed from Southern Europe. Inocybe taxocystis is confirmed as a later synonym of I. favrei. The species has a wide geographical distribution range in Europe, mainly restricted to the alpine zone and moist soils, associated with Salix herbacea. Inocybe arctica is here described as a new species. It occurs in the arctic and higher alpine zones, associated with Dryas octopetala, Salix polaris, S. reticulata and S. herbacea. All species except I. arctica are shown to have an intercontinental distribution range and are confirmed from North America. Sequence data suggest the occurrence of one additional species in the alpine zone of China. A key to the species in the I. praetervisa group is provided. (C) 2017 The Mycological Society of Japan.

AB  - Dwarf shrub heaths are common vegetation types of the Arctic and Subarctic. Some of the dominant plants in these communities release toxic substances which can affect neighbouring plants. We investigated the effects of leaf extracts from two dwarf shrubs, Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum hermaphroditum, and from mountain birch, Betula pubescens spp, tortuosa, on nematode community structure and reproduction in a pot and an agar culture experiment. In pots two graminoids, Carex bigelowii and Festuca vivipara, were grown in previously sterilized or non-sterilized soil. Soil was collected from a subarctic heath, and plants from a fellfield site, near Abisko, northern Swedish Lapland. The naturally occurring nematode community at the heath site is also described, A total of 34 nematode taxa were observed at the field site and 32 taxa in the pot experiment. Most species, especially frequent taxa, occurred in both soils. Potted soil was strongly dominated by bacterial feeders and showed a shift towards a more colonizer controlled population. These changes were presumably due to the establishment of residual species after freezing and/or sterilization of the soil prior to incubation in the laboratory. Direct exposure of the nematode Aphelenchoides saprophilus to the leaf extracts in agar cultures resulted in a lower reproduction rate. Leaf extract treatment in potted soil altered nematode species composition and dominance structure, and generally reduced species number and maturity index. The diversity of genera was decreased by all extract treatments in pots with Carer, Nematode population density was not affected, except after application of Betula extracts, where significantly higher densities occurred. Nematode data were related to respiration and active fungal biomass in the soil, indicating that rather than allelochemicals with nematicidal properties, carbohydrates in the leaf extracts promoting a beneficial microflora may have affected the nematode community.

AB  - From 18 soil samples taken in the vicinity of the permanent Bulgarian Antarctic base "St. Kliment Ohridski" (62A degrees 38'29aEuro(3)S, 60A degrees 21'53aEuro(3)W) on Livingston Island, 109 filamentous fungi were isolated on selective media. The most widespread fungal species were members of the genera Cladosporium, Geomyces, Penicillium and Aspergillus. Other species, already recorded in Antarctic environment, were also isolated: Lecanicillium muscarium, Epicoccum nigrum and Alternaria alternata. Thirty strains demonstrating good growth were screened for antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) that play an important role in the defense of aerobic organisms against oxidative stress, by converting reactive oxygen species into nontoxic molecules. Six of them showed high enzyme activity. The tested strains produced SOD with statistically significant higher activity at 15A degrees C than at 30A degrees C suggesting that this enzyme is cold-active. Such SOD could be useful in medicine and cosmetics. The best producer of cold-active SOD, Aspergillus glaucus 363, cultivated in bioreactors, demonstrated optimal growth temperature at 25A degrees C and maximum enzyme activities at 25 and 30A degrees C for SOD and CAT, respectively. The electrophoretical analysis showed that the fungus possesses Cu/Zn-SOD.

AB  - Symbiotic fungi's role in providing nitrogen to host plants is well-studied in tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska, but little-studied in the adjoining boreal forest ecosystem. Along a 570 km north-south transect from the Yukon River to the North Slope of Alaska, the N-15 content was strongly reduced in ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plants including Betula, Salix, Picea mariana (P. Mill.) B. S. P., Picea glauca Moench (Voss), and ericaceous plants. Compared with the N-15 content of soil, the foliage of nonmycorrhizal plants (Carex and Eriophorum) was unchanged, whereas content of the ectomycorrhizal fungi was very much higher (e. g., Boletaceae, Leccinum and Cortinarius). It is hypothesized that similar processes operate in tundra and boreal forest, both nitrogen-limited ecosystems: (i) mycorrhizal fungi break down soil polymers and take up amino acids or other nitrogen compounds; (ii) mycorrhizal fungi fractionate against N-15 during production of transfer compounds; (iii) host plants are accordingly depleted in N-15; and (iv) mycorrhizal fungi are enriched in N-15. Increased N availability for plant roots or decreased light availability to understory plants may have decreased N allocation to mycorrhizal partners and increased delta N-15 by 3 parts per thousand-4 parts per thousand for southern populations of Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. and Salix. Fungal biomass, measured as ergosterol, correlated strongly with soil organic matter and attained amounts similar to those in temperate forest soils.

AB  - Penicillium spp, isolated from the sediments of ponds in continental Antarctica have been studied and compared with species obtained from similar environments in the Apennines of the Liguria region, in northwestern Italy. The antibacterial activity exhibited by some strains was evaluated against standard strains using both liquid and solid media. The preliminary data suggest an antibacterial activity similar to beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB  - Background: Cellulose can be converted to ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The difference between the optimal temperature of cellulase and microbial fermentation, however, has been identified as the critical problem with SSF. In this study, one fungal strain (AnsX1) with high cellulase activity at low temperature was isolated from Antarctic soils and identified as Verticillium sp. by morphological and molecular analyses. Results: The biochemical properties of crude AnsX1 cellulase samples were studied by filter paper cellulase assay. The maximum cellulase activity was achieved at low temperature in an acidic environment with addition of metal ions. Furthermore, AnsX1 cellulase demonstrated 54-63% enzymatic activity at ethanol concentrations of 5-10%. AnsX1 cellulase production was influenced by inoculum size, carbon and nitrogen sources, and elicitors. The optimal culture conditions for AnsX1 cellulase production were 5% inoculum, wheat bran as carbon source, (NH4)(2)SO4 as nitrogen source, and sorbitol added in the medium. Conclusions: Our present work has potential to enable the development of an economic and efficient cold-adapted cellulase system for bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels in future.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi have been shown to survive sub-zero temperatures in axenic culture and in the field. However, the physiological basis for resistance to freezing is poorly understood. In order to survive freezing, mycelia must synthesise compounds that protect the cells from frost damage, and certain fungal-specific soluble carbohydrates have been implicated in this role. Tissue concentrations of arabitol, mannitol and trehalose were measured in axenic cultures of eight Hebeloma strains of arctic and temperate origin grown at 22, 12, 6 and 2degreesC. In a separate experiment, mycelia were frozen to -5degreesC after pre-conditioning at either 2degreesC or 22degreesC. For. some, especially temperate strains, there was a clear increase in specific soluble carbohydrates at lower growth temperatures. Trehalose and mannitol were present in all strains and the highest concentrations (close to 2.5% and 0.5% dry wt.) were recorded only after a cold period. Arabitol was found in four strains only when grown at low, temperature. Cold pre-conditioning enhanced recovery of mycelia following freezing. In four out of eight strains, this was paralleled by increases in mannitol and trehalose concentration at low temperature that presumably contribute towards cryoprotection. The results are discussed in an ecological context with regard to mycelial overwintering in soil.

TI  - EFFECT OF SPRING THAW ON MICROORGANISMS IN AN ARCTIC MEADOW SITE
T2  - ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Quantitative changes in bacterial, fungal and algal populations in the surface peat (0-5 cm depth) were studied during the spring thaw period at a tundra hummocky sedge-moss meadow (Devon Island, N.W.T. [Northwest Territories], Canada). A significant peak in numbers of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and in amounts of filamentous algae was observed during the thaw period. No significant maximum in fungal standing crop was evident during this period but an increase in the hyphae containing protoplasm after thaw was indicative of increased fungal activity. Data obtained at each sampling time were highly variable. This was probably due to the topographic heterogeneity of the site which gave rise to variation in soil moisture content and microenvironment. Qualitative changes in bacterial populations were studied before and after the thaw. Gram-negative psychotrophic types predominated and Bacillus spp. were rarely isolated. Certain gram-negative groups, the fluorescent pseudomonads and the Cytophaga/Flexibacter types, were isolated less frequently after thaw while gram-negative orange pigmented rods, Arthrobacter spp. and other coryneforms occurred more frequently after the thaw.

AB  - The effect of 36 l m-2 of 20% and 100% methanol spillage on the microflora of a soil near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, was assessed. GLC was used to monitor the residual methanol in the soil. Associated with residual methanol determination were measurements of changes in numbers of bacteria, fungal standing crop, respiration and isolation of methanol-utilizing bacteria. Methanol spillage (20%) had 2 different effects on the surface vegetation, in that the vegetation was killed in some plots and not others. The applied methanol disappeared completely between 1-4 wk. No increased soil activity (as indicated by respiration, bacterial numbers, fungal standing crop) was detected when methanol was present in the soil. Because only 1 bacterium (i.e., pink gram negative rods) metabolized only very small concentrations of methanol, biodegradation of methanol was not considered a significant agent affecting methanol loss from the soil.

AB  - The Arctic and Antarctic share environmental extremes. To survive in such environments, microbes such as soil fungi need to compete with or protect themselves effectively from other soil microbiota and to obtain the often scarce nutrients available, and many use secondary metabolites to facilitate this. We therefore (i) screened for antimicrobial properties of cold-environment Arctic and Antarctic soil fungi, and (ii) identified changes in the secreted secondary metabolite profiles of a subset of these strains in response to temperature variation. A total of 40 polar soil fungal strains from King George Island, maritime Antarctic and Hornsund, Svalbard, High Arctic, were obtained from the Malaysian National Antarctic Research Centre culture collections. The plug assay technique was used to screen for antimicrobial potential against Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli). About 45% of the tested fungal strains showed antimicrobial activity against at least one tested microorganism. Three fungal isolates showed good bioactivity and were subjected to secondary metabolite profiling at different temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 28 degrees C). We observed a range of responses in fungal metabolite production when incubated at varying temperatures, confirming an influence of environmental conditions such as temperature on the production of secondary metabolites.

AB  - In this study, we accessed culturable fungal assemblages present in the sediments of three lakes potentially impacted anthropogenically in the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica and identified 63 taxa.Cladosporiumsp. 2,Pseudeurotium hygrophilum, andPseudogymnoascus verrucosuswere recovered from the sampled sediments of all lakes. High concentrations of metals and the lowest fungal diversity indices were detected in the sediments of the Central Lake, which can be influenced by human activities due to their proximity to research stations to those of the other two lakes, which were far from the Antarctic stations. At least one type of biological activity was demonstrated by 40 fungal extracts. Among these,P. hygrophilum,P. verrucosus,Penicillium glabrum, andPenicillium solitumdemonstrated strong trypanocidal, herbicidal, and antifungal activities. Our results suggest that an increase of the anthropogenic activities in the region might have affected the microbial diversity and composition. In addition, the fungal diversity in these lakes may be a useful model to study the effect of anthropogenic activities in Antarctica. We isolated a diverse group of fungal taxa from Antarctic lake sediments, which have the potential to produce novel compounds for the both the medical and agriculture sectors.

AB  - This study describes the biodiversity of the indigenous microbial community in the sodium-chloride water brines (cryopegs) derived from ancient marine sediments and sandwiched within permafrost 100-120,000 years ago after the Arctic Ocean regression. Cryopegs remain liquid at the in situ temperature of -9 to -11 degrees C and make up the only habitat on the Earth that is characterized by permanently subzero temperatures, high salinity, and the absence of external influence during geological time. From these cryopegs, anaerobic and aerobic, spore-less and spore-forming, halotolerant and halophilic, psychrophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, mycelial fungi and yeast were isolated and their activity was detected below 0 degrees C.

AB  - This dataset includes information regarding fungal strains collected during several Antarctic expeditions: the Italian National Antarctic Research program (PNRA) expeditions "X" (1994/1995), "XII" (1996/1997), "XVII" (2001/2002), "XIX" (2003/2004), "XXVI" (2010/2011), the Czech "IPY Expedition" (2007-2009) and a number of strains donated by E. Imre Friedmann (Florida State University) in 2001, isolated from samples collected during the U.S.A. Antarctic Expeditions of 1980-1982. Samples, consisting of colonized rocks, mosses, lichens, sediments and soils, were collected in Southern and Northern Victoria Land of the continental Antarctica and in the Antarctic Peninsula. A total of 259 different strains were isolated, belonging to 32 genera and 38 species, out of which 12 represented new taxa. These strains are preserved in the Antarctic section of the Culture Collection of Fungi from Extreme Environments (CCFEE), which represents one of the collections associated with the Italian National Antarctic Museum (MNA, Section of Genoa, Italy), located at the Laboratory of Systematic Botany and Mycology, Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University (Viterbo, Italy). The CCFEE hosts a total of 486 Antarctic fungal strains from worldwide extreme environments. Distributional records are reported here for 259 of these strains. The holotypes of the 12 new species included in this dataset are maintained at CCFEE and in other international collections: CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (Utrecht, Netherlands); DBVPG, Industrial Yeasts Collection (University of Perugia, Italy); DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Brunswick, Germany); IMI, International Mycological Institute (London, U.K.).

AB  - The majority of islands surrounding the Antarctic continent are poorly characterized in terms of microbial macroecology due to their remote locations, geographical isolation and access difficulties. The 2016/2017 Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) provided unprecedented access to a number of these islands. In the present study we use metagenomic methods to investigate the microbial ecology of soil samples recovered from 11 circum-Antarctic islands as part of ACE, and to investigate the functional potential of their soil microbial communities. Comparisons of the prokaryote and lower eukaryote phylogenetic compositions of the soil communities indicated that the various islands harbored spatially distinct microbiomes with limited overlap. In particular, we identified a high prevalence of lichen-associated fungal taxa in the soils, suggesting that terrestrial lichens may be one of the key drivers of soil microbial ecology on these islands. Differential abundance and redundancy analyses suggested that these soil microbial communities are also strongly shaped by multiple abiotic factors, including soil pH and average annual temperatures. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the islands sampled in this study can be clustered into three distinct large-scale biogeographical regions in a conservation context, the sub-, Maritime and Continental Antarctic, which are distinct in both environmental conditions and microbial ecology, but are consistent with the widely-used regionalization applied to multicellular Antarctic terrestrial organisms. Functional profiling of the island soil metagenomes from these three broad biogeographical regions also suggested a degree of functional differentiation, reflecting their distinct microbial ecologies. Taken together, these results represent the most extensive characterization of the microbial ecology of Antarctic island soils to date.

AB  - Using the method of inoculation of elective nutrient media, the abundance and taxonomic diversity of ecological and trophic groups of microorganisms in soils of the northern part of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago were evaluated. The content of aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen fixers, as well as denitrifiers, was low (tens and hundreds of CFU/g soil). The number of saprotrophic bacteria varied from 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) CFU/g soil; actinomycetes, from 1.3 x 10(3) to 4.0 x 10(5) CFU/g soil; and micromycetes, from 2.5 x 10(2) to 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/g soil. The abundances of all studied groups of microorganisms (except for aerobic nitrogen fixers) in the studied soils sharply decreased down the profile, and this correlated positively with the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen. The community of soil microorganisms was dominated by gram-positive bacteria of the genera Arthrobacter and Bacillus; actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces and Micromonospora; and micromycetes of the genera Goffeauzyma, Phoma, Pseudogymnoascus, and Thelebolus. In general, the abundance and taxonomic diversity of cultured microorganisms in the soils of the northern part of Novaya Zemlya were lower than in the soils of the more northern territories of the Franz Josef Land Archipelago. This phenomenon is associated with the drying and cooling effect of the largest glacier in Russia on the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago.

AB  - This paper reports the discovery of endolithic algae from vertical limestone cliffs associated with the Niagara Escarpment, southern Ontario, Canada. The endolithic habitat forms a distinctive dark green layer 1-3 mm below the surface of the porous dolomitic limestone. Samples of the algal layer were isolated from freshly cleaved rock samples using sterile probes and grown on a solid (agarized) standard algal mineral medium supplemented with soil extract. A diverse assemblage of organisms grew on the agar plates, including bacteria, fungi, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), green algae, yellow-green algae, and occasionally the protonemata of mosses. Isolated algae belong to unicellular, colonial, and filamentous morphological types. Algal genera that have been identified include seven blue-green algae (Cyanophyta or Cyanobacteria), six green algae (Chlorophyta), and one yellow-green alga (Xanthophyceae). Six of the algal genera found in Ontario rocks also occur inside rocks of the Colorado plateau in northern Arizona, and one genus also occurs inside Antarctic rocks.

AB  - The mycobiota of the following soils of the Franz Josef Land archipelago was characterized using the classical plating techniques and real-time PCR methods: Cryosols (Arenic), Cryosols (Loamic), Oxyaquic Cryosols (Loamic), Leptosols (Loamic), and Cryosols (Loamic, Humic). The total abundance of microscopic fungi varied from 3.10 x 10(1) CFU/g soil in deep mineral horizons to 6.56 x 10(3) CFU/g soil in the upper organogenic soil horizons. A total of 47 micromycete species were isolated, which belonged to 32 genera from three divisions. Psychrotolerant strains growing at both 5 and 25 degrees C were predominant. The genera Penicillium (five species), Cadophora (four species), Cladosporium, Phoma, and Thelebolus (three species each) exhibited the highest species diversity. The most numerous genera: Penicillium, Hyphozyma, Phoma, Antarctomyces, and Pseudogymnoascus, were saprotrophic and common in cold ecosystems. Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Hyphozyma variabilis var. variabilis, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, Thelebolus microsporus, and Goffeauzyma gilvescens were the species most often revealed by plating (over 40% occurrence). A significant part (30%) of identified species were those included in the BSL database of species pathogenic for humans and animals. The number of copies of fungal rRNA gene ITSs varied from 1.00 x 10(9) to 4.40 x 10(10) copies/g soil in the mineral and organogenic layers, respectively. Spatial heterogeneity of mycobiota in the soils of the Franz Josef Land archipelago was revealed within the upper 5-cm layer, while deeper horizons were characterized by a uniform structure of micromycete communities.

AB  - AimsThe aim of this study was to cross correlate data on physico-chemical parameters of soil with rhizosphere microorganisms and plant species in order to gain more knowledge about formation of soil and development of plants in the face of the changing climate on Spitsbergen and relations between them.MethodsWe investigated physico-chemical parameters of soil samples and the number and biodiversity of microorganisms, bacteria (oligotrophic and copiotrophic), and fungi. Moreover, heavy metal concentrations in 6 species of vascular plants collected in different areas were analysed.ResultsThe soil samples varied considerably in pH - from acid to alkaline, texture - from sand to loamy sand, and C:N ratio - from very low to high. In the soils, only partial Cd elevation expressed as the geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and the enrichment factor (EF) was detected. In the plants, the most significantly elevated concentrations of heavy metals expressed as I-geo and EF as well as the biological accumulation factor, bioconcentration factor, and translocation factor were detected in Salix polaris, Dryas octopetala, and Draba corymbosa. The high number of bacteria corresponded with an increase in the ecophysiological diversity index and the low colony development index, whereas a reverse relationship was found for fungi.ConclusionsThere was no significant impact of the geochemical properties on the total content of heavy metals in soil. The similar position of Cd and Pb in the order of heavy metal accumulation in the soil and plants was confirmed. TF showed that mainly these two metals were transported efficiently from roots to shoots. In the plants, the metals were distributed depending on the life form and their higher levels were detected in the woody perennials, e.g. S. polaris, D. octopetala, D. corymbosa, than in the herbaceous perennials. Very high numbers of culturable microorganisms were determined, regardless of the soil properties and plant species, which indicated that they were involved in the transformation of compounds containing C, N, and P and in the availability of heavy metals. The microorganisms and plants colonizing Spitsbergen soils showed great plasticity and adaptability to low temperatures and elevated Cd content.

AB  - A novel psychrophilic basidiomycetous species is described in a new anamorphic genus as Mrakiella cryoconiti gen. nov., sp. nov.; the type strain of Mrakiella cryoconiti is strain A15(T) (=CBS 10834(T)-DSM 21094(T)). Two representatives were isolated from alpine glacier cryoconite and from northern Siberian sediment. Physiological and biochemical properties are similar to characteristics shared by members of the genus Mrakia, although sexual reproduction is absent. Mrakiella cryoconiti strains are psychrophilic and produce cold-active pectate lyase. Sequence analyses of the ITS and 26S rRNA D1/D2 regions indicated that these strains represent a distinct taxon within the Mrakia clade of the order Cystofilobasidiales, class Tremellomycetes and phylum Basidiomycota. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, Cryptococcus aquaticus (a member of the Mrakia clade) is transferred to the newly described genus as Mrakiella aquatica comb. nov.

AB  - Among 97 fungal strains isolated from soil collected in the arctic tundra (Spitsbergen), Penicillium chrysogenum 9' was found to be the best lipase producer. The maximum lipase activity was 68 units mL(-1) culture medium on the fifth day of incubation at pH 6.0 and 20 degrees C. Therefore, P. chrysogenum 9' was classified as a psychrotrophic microorganism. The non-specific extracellular lipase showed a maximum activity at 30 degrees C and pH 5.0 for natural oils or at pH 7.0 for synthetic substrates. Tributyrin was found to be the best substrate for lipase, among those tested. The K-m and V-max were calculated to be 2.33 mM and 22.1 units mL(-1), respectively, with tributyrin as Substrate. The enzyme was inhibited more by EDTA than by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and was reactivated by Ca2+. The P. chrysogenum 9' lipase was very stable in the presence of hexane and 1,4-dioxane at a concentration of 50%, whereas it was unstable in presence of xylene.

AB  - The genus Pseudogymnoascus includes several species frequently isolated from extreme environments worldwide, including cold environments such as Antarctica. This study describes three new species of Pseudogymnoascus-P. russus sp. nov., P. irelandiae sp. nov., and P. ramosus sp. nov.-isolated from Antarctic soils. These species represent the first Pseudogymnoascus taxa to be formally described from Antarctic soil samples, expanding our understanding of fungal biodiversity in this extreme environment. Microscopic descriptions of asexual structures from living cultures, along with measurements of cultural characteristics and growth on various media types at different temperatures, identify three distinct new species. In addition, phylogenetic analyses based on five gene regions (ITS, LSU, MCM7, RPB2, TEF1) and whole-genome proteomes place these new species within three distinct previously described clades: P. irelandiae in clade K, P. ramosus in clade Q, and P. russus in clade B. These results provide further evidence of the extensive undescribed diversity of Pseudogymnoascus in high-latitude soils. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on Antarctic mycology and the broader ecology of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant fungi.

AB  - Psychrophilic fungi are a critical biotic component in cold deserts that serves a central role in nutrient recycling and biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological significance, culture-independent studies on psychrophilic mycobiome are limited. In the present study, the fungal diversity patterns across the Drass, an Indian cold desert in the Himalaya, were indexed by targeted amplicon pyrosequencing (ITS). In the Drass dataset, Ascomycota was represented by 92 genera, while 22 genera represented Basidiomycota. The most abundant genus was Conocybe (20.46%). Most of the identified genera were reported in the literature to be prolific extracellular hydrolytic enzyme producers. To identify whether the Drass fungal assemblages share similarities to other cold deserts, these were further compared to Antarctic and Arctic cold deserts. Comparative analysis across the three cold deserts indicated the dominance of Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The observed alpha diversity, Shannon index as well as Pielou's evenness was highest in the Antarctic followed by Drass and Arctic datasets. The genera Malassezia, Preussia, Pseudogymnoascus, Cadophora, Geopora, Monodictys, Tetracladium, Titaea, Mortierella, and Cladosporium were common to all the cold deserts. Furthermore, Conocybe was represented predominantly in Drass. Interestingly, the genus Conocybe has not been previously reported from any other studies on Antarctic or Arctic biomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fungal metagenome study in Drass soil. Our analysis shows that despite the similarities of low temperature among the cold deserts, a significant differential abundance of fungal communities prevails in the global cold deserts.

AB  - Deception Island is well-known for harboring highly diverse microbial communities due to its unique volcanic environment in Antarctica. Most studies focused on bacteria, and relatively little was known about the fungal species on this island. The present study was aimed to determine the antimicrobial production and nutrient utilization profiles of a soil fungus from Deception Island, designated as Im33. Our findings showed that the strain had maximum mycelial growth and sporulation on malt-extract agar (MEA) medium, but it demonstrated the strongest antimicrobial activity in yeast extract-malt extract broth (YMB) medium. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 regions showed that it is a species belonging to the genus Talaromyces. It was resistant to cycloheximide concentrations up to 1,000 mg/L and exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative test pathogens, as well as being able to utilize a variety of carbon sources. This is the first report of a Talaromyces species from Deception Island. The capability of the strain to produce broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds and various enzymes indicated that Antarctic fungi, like their bacterial counterparts, have adopted various adaptation strategies to compete and survive in the extreme environment.

AB  - Studies on the diversity and catabolic functionality of fungi in Arctic soils are still scarce. This knowledge gap needs to be urgently addressed, as global warming may have unpredictable effects on cold-adapted fungal species. We isolated two yeast species of the family Filobasidiaceae: Goffeauzyma gilvescens and Naganishia albidosimilis, from soil in central Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and characterised their metabolic properties at two temperatures, 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C, in a laboratory test using Biolog (R) FF plates. The results of the Biolog (R) test, which followed molecular identification of the strains, confirmed that the two species differed in their functional (catabolic) characteristics. The effect of temperature was also highly significant and the metabolic characteristics of two species varied between the two temperatures tested. As expected, among other chemical guilds of substrates on Biolog (R) plates, carbohydrates were the most used and also the most segregating of the strains studied, especially at 20 degrees C. However, the relative use of almost all substrate groups changed between the two temperatures for both species tested, indicating that temperature can also affect soil microorganisms indirectly by altering their metabolic pathways. As soil microorganisms form a complex trophic and non-trophic network, such changes in metabolism under increasing temperature may also alter relationships between species and between species and the environment. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the microbial ecology of the unique ecosystem of polar soils.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play fundamental roles in cycling of soil carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients, yet we have a poor understanding of how soil microbiomes are shaped by their nutritional and physical environment. In this study, we investigated the successional dynamics of a soil microbiome during 21 weeks of enrichment on chitin and its monomer, N-acetylglucosamine. We examined succession of the soil communities in a physically heterogeneous soil matrix as well as a homogeneous liquid medium. The guiding hypothesis was that the initial species richness would influence the tendency for the selected consortia to stabilize and maintain a relatively constant community structure over time. We also hypothesized that long-term, substrate-driven growth would result in consortia with reduced species richness compared to the parent microbiome and that this process would be deterministic with relatively little variation between replicates. We found that the initial species richness does influence the long-term community stability in both liquid media and soil and that lower initial richness results in a more rapid convergence to stability. Despite use of the same soil inoculum and access to the same major substrate, the resulting community composition differed greatly in soil from that in liquid medium. Hence, distinct selective pressures in soils relative to homogenous liquid media exist and can control community succession dynamics. This difference is likely related to the fact that soil microbiomes are more likely to thrive, with fewer compositional changes, in a soil matrix than in liquid environments.
   IMPORTANCE The soil microbiome carries out important ecosystem functions, but interactions between soil microbial communities have been difficult to study due to the high microbial diversity and complexity of the soil habitat. In this study, we successfully obtained stable consortia with reduced complexity that contained species found in the original source soil. These consortia and the methods used to obtain them can be a valuable resource for exploration of specific mechanisms underlying soil microbial community ecology. The results of this study also provide new experimental context to better inform how soil microbial communities are shaped by new environments and how a combination of initial taxonomic structure and physical environment influences stability.

AB  - The modern concept of the evolution of Mars assumes that life could potentially have originated on the planet Mars, possibly during the end of the late heavy bombardment, and could then be transferred to other planets. Since then, physical and chemical conditions on Mars changed and now strongly limit the presence of terrestrial-like life forms. These adverse conditions include scarcity of liquid water (although brine solutions may exist), low temperature and atmospheric pressure, and cosmic radiation. Ionizing radiation is very important among these life-constraining factors because it damages DNA and other cellular components, particularly in liquid conditions where radiation-induced reactive oxidants diffuse freely. Here, we investigated the impact of high doses (up to 2 kGy) of densely-ionizing (197.6 keV/mu m), space-relevant iron ions (corresponding on the irradiation that reach the uppermost layer of the Mars subsurface) on the survival of an extremophilic terrestrial organism-Cryomyces antarcticus-in liquid medium and under atmospheric conditions, through different techniques. Results showed that it survived in a metabolically active state when subjected to high doses of Fe ions and was able to repair eventual DNA damages. It implies that some terrestrial life forms can withstand prolonged exposure to space-relevant ion radiation.

AB  - Background: Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp & Endl.) Krasser, known as "lenga" is the most important timber wood species in southernmost Patagonia (Argentina). Humicolopsis cephalosporioides Cabral & Marchand is a soil fungus associated with Nothofagus pumilio forests, which has outstanding cellulolytic activity. However, there is no information about the ability of this fungus to use organic substrates other than cellulose, and its ability to produce different enzyme systems, as well as its response to temperature.
   Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the role of H. cephalosporioides in degradation processes in N. pumilio forests in detail by evaluating the in vitro ability of four isolates of this fungus to grow and produce different lytic enzyme systems, and their response to incubation temperature.
   Methods: The ability of the fungi to grow and produce enzyme systems was estimated by inoculating them on agar media with specific substrates, and the cultures were incubated at three temperatures.
   Results: A differential behavior of each strain in levels of growth and enzyme activity was found according to the medium type and/or incubation temperature.
   Conclusions: A intra-specific variability was found in H. cephalosporioides. Likewise a possible link between the saprotrophic role of this fungus in N. pumilio forests and the degradation of organic matter under stress conditions, such as those from frosty environments, was also discussed.

AB  - Psychrotolerant yeast Rhodotorula sp. Y-23 was isolated from the sediment core sub-samples of Nella Lake, East Antarctica. Isolate was screened for lipase production using plate assay method followed by submerged fermentation. Production optimization revealed the maximum lipase production by using palmolein oil (5% v/v), pH 8.0 and inoculum size of 2.5% v/v at 15 degrees C. The potential inducers for lipase were 1% w/v of galactose and KNO3, and MnCl2 (0.1% w/v). Final productions with optimized conditions gave 5.47-fold increase in lipase production. Dialyzed product gave a purification fold of 5.63 with specific activity of 26.83Umg(-1) and 15.67% yields. This lipase was more stable at pH 5.0 and -20 degrees C whereas more activity was found at pH 8.0 and 35 degrees C. Stability was more in 50mM Fe3+, EDTA-Na (20mM), sodium deoxycholate (20mM), H2O2 (1% v/v), and almost all organic solvents (50% v/v). Tolerance capacity at wider range of pH and temperature with having lower K-m value i.e., 0.08mgml(-1) and higher V-max 385.68Umg(-1) at 15 degrees C make the studied lipase useful for industrial applications. Besides this, the lipase was compatible with commercially available detergents, and its addition to them increases lipid degradation performances making it a potential candidate in detergent formulation.

AB  - Pythium ultimum var. ultimum was isolated from carrot seedlings with damping off and from soil used for growing the plant in a greenhouse on Spitsbergen Island, Svalbard. The fungus caused severe damping off of carrot, cucumber and tomato seedlings after artificial inoculation. The rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequences of the Svalbard isolate were identical to those of Canadian and Japanese isolates of P. ultimum var. ultimum. The results suggest that the pathogen in the greenhouse on Svalbard was probably introduced from temperate regions through contaminated plants and/or soil imported to the island. This is the first record of P. ultimum var. ultimum within the Arctic zone.

AB  - The role of organo-mineral interactions, microbial dynamics, and vertical plant input profiles are hypothesized to be important in controlling soil organic matter (SOM) stocks and dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we enhanced and applied a model (Biotic and Abiotic Model of SOM BAMSI) that represents microbial dynamics and organo-mineral interactions integrated with a multiphase reactive transport solver for variably saturated porous media. The model represents aqueous chemistry, aqueous advection and diffusion, gaseous diffusion, sorption processes, bacterial and fungal activity, and archetypal monomer-and polymer-carbon substrate groups, including dead cell wall material. This model structure is fundamentally different, and produces different SOM dynamics, than the pseudo-first order relationships that are used in most site-and global-scale terrestrial SOM models. We simulated two grasslands, a seven-site chronosequence (-3.9-240 K gamma) in Northern California, and a Russian Chernozem site where soils were sampled 100 years apart. We calibrated the model's vertically-resolved soil bulk specific surface area (SBSSA) using observed bulk SOM content, and then tested the model against observed triangle C-14 profiles. The modeled microbial processes, organo-mineral interactions, and vertical aqueous transport produced realistic vertically-resolved predictions of bulk SOM content, triangle C-14 values of SOM, lignin content, and fungi -to-aerobic bacteria biomass ratios. Using sensitivity analyses, we found that vertical carbon input profiles were important controls over the triangle C-14 depth distribution. Shallower carbon input profiles lead to older carbon at depth. In addition, the SBSSA was the dominant control over the magnitude and vertical distribution of SOM stocks. The findings of this study demonstrate the value of explicitly incorporating microbial activity, sorption, and vertical transport into land models to predict SOM dynamics.

AB  - Temperatures approaching or exceeding 20 degrees C have been measured during summer in polar regions at the surfaces of barren fellfield soils under cloudless skies around solar noon. However, despite the upper temperature limit for the growth of cold-adapted microbes-which are abundant in polar soils and have pivotal roles in nutrient cycling-typically being close to this temperature, previous studies have not addressed the consequences of climate change for the metabolism of these organisms in the natural environment. Here in a 5-year field experiment on Alexander Island in the southern maritime Antarctic, we show that the abundance of Pseudogymnoascus roseus, the most widespread decomposer fungus in maritime Antarctic fellfield soils, is reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude when irrigated and nutrient-amended soils are warmed to >20 degrees C during summer. Laboratory experiments under conditions mimicking those during midsummer in the natural environment indicated that the hyphal extension rates of P. roseus isolates and the activities of five extracellular enzymes are reduced by 54%-96% at high water availability after exposure to temperatures cycling daily from 2 to 21 degrees C and 2 to 24 degrees C, relative to temperatures cycling from 2 to 18 degrees C. Given that the temperatures of surface soils at the study site already reach 19 degrees C during midsummer, the observations reported here suggest that, at predicted rates of warming arising from moderate greenhouse gas emissions, inhibitory effects of climate change on the metabolism of P. roseus could manifest themselves within the next few decades. Furthermore, with peak temperatures at the surfaces of fellfield soils at other maritime Antarctic locations and in High Arctic and alpine regions already exceeding 20 degrees C during summer, the observations suggest that climate warming has the potential to inhibit the growth of other cold-adapted microbes, with negative effects on soils as the Earth's climate continues to warm.

AB  - Understanding the biogeographic patterns of root-associated fungi and their sensitivity to temperature may improve predictions of future changes in terrestrial biodiversity and associated ecosystem processes, but data are currently limited. Anticipating change will require combining observational data, which predict how climatic factors limit current species distributions, with direct manipulations of climate, which can isolate responses to specific climate variables. Root endophytes are common symbionts of plants, particularly in arctic and alpine environments, yet their responses to climate warming are not resolved. Here, we directly cultured endophytic fungi from roots collected along altitudinal gradients in replicated mountain watersheds and from a 27 y field warming experiment in the Rocky Mountains, USA, to improve understanding of climate impacts on fungal root endophytes. Fungal taxa that were common at high elevations declined most under climate warming, whereas low elevation dominants responded neutrally or increased with experimental warming. Altitudinal gradients in fungal communities were strongly specific to the plant host species. Specifically, Poa species had 25-60% greater fungal isolate abundance and 25-38% greater fungal diversity at high elevations than at low elevation sites. In contrast, Festuca thurberi had 64% lower fungal diversity on roots at high elevation than at low elevation. Our results help to improve understanding of the potential for climate change to alter plant-fungal interactions in mountain ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities have been studied worldwide; however, those in the very cold and dry continental climate zone of northern Eurasia remain understudied. We investigated EM fungal community structure on plant roots and its determinants in eastern Siberia. We identified 291 EM fungal taxa belonging to 37 fungal genera from nine sites spanning 2100 km. In a variation partitioning analysis, host plant phylogeny was the primary factor that explained variation in fungal community composition, followed by spatial distance, soil, and climate. Host specificity and preference were attributed to differences in EM fungal community composition among host plants. The EM fungal community on Larix cajanderi, the dominant canopy tree in the region, was characterized by a high proportion of Suillus and Rhizopogon species. This implies that these specialist fungal symbionts have a close ecological relationship with pioneer Larix trees to adapt to the harsh continental climate of Siberia.

AB  - The diversity of yeasts collected from different sites in Antarctica (Admiralty Bay, King George Island and Port Foster Bay and Deception Island) and their ability to produce extracellular enzymes and mycosporines were studied. Samples were collected during the austral summer season, between November 2006 and January 2007, from the rhizosphere of Deschampsia antarctica, ornithogenic (penguin guano) soil, soil, marine and lake sediments, marine water and freshwater from lakes. A total of 89 isolates belonging to the following genera were recovered: Bensingtonia, Candida, Cryptococcus, Debaryomyces, Dioszegia, Exophiala, Filobasidium, Issatchenkia (Pichia), Kodamaea, Leucosporidium, Leucosporidiella, Metschnikowia, Nadsonia, Pichia, Rhodotorula, and Sporidiobolus, and the yeast-like fungi Aureobasidium, Leuconeurospora and Microglossum. Cryptococcus victoriae was the most frequently identified species. Several species isolated in our study have been previously reported to be Antarctic psychophilic yeasts, including Cr. antarcticus, Cr. victoriae, Dioszegia hungarica and Leucosporidium scottii. The cosmopolitan yeast species A. pullulans, C. zeylanoides, D. hansenii, I. orientalis, K. ohmeri, P. guilliermondii, Rh. mucilaginosa, and S. salmonicolor were also isolated. Five possible new species were identified. Sixty percent of the yeasts had at least one detectable extracellular enzymatic activity. Cryptococcus antarcticus, D. aurantiaca, D. crocea, D. hungarica, Dioszegia sp., E. xenobiotica, Rh. glaciales, Rh. laryngis, Microglossum sp. 1 and Microglossum sp. 2 produced mycosporines. Of the yeast isolates, 41.7% produced pigments and/or mycosporines and could be considered adapted to survive in Antarctica. Most of the yeasts had extracellular enzymatic activities at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C, indicating that they could be metabolically active in the sampled substrates.

AB  - Two new cold-adapted yeast species, Cystobasidium tubakii sp. nov. and Cystobasidium ongulense sp. nov., were isolated from soil collected from East Ongul Island, East Antarctica, during the 49th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE 49). Molecular analysis based on large subunit (LSU) D1/D2 domain and the combined sequences of small subunit (SSU) rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, LSU D1/D2 domain and TEF1 sequences showed that these species are novel. Both species could grow at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free media. These characteristics were likely obtained by the yeasts to survive oligotrophic environments such as that in Antarctica. This is the first report of new fungal species isolated from near the Syowa station in the 60-y history of JARE. (C) 2016 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB  - Investigations of microbial diversity in Antarctic are important to begin to understand ecosystem functioning and decomposition processes. This study documents fungi at 9 historic sites on the Antarctic Peninsula collected from wooden structures, other organic materials, and soils during a joint National Science Foundation and British Antarctic Survey expedition in 2007. Many of these sites had wooden structures built by the British during the World War II Operation Tabarin, but others visited included the American "East Base'' on Stonington Island and the Swedish hut on Snow Hill Island. Fungi were cultured on several different media and pure cultures were obtained and identified by DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Cadophora species previously found to attack historic wooden structures on Ross Island, Antarctica, were found at all but 1 location sampled in the Peninsula region. Fungi causing decay in the historic wooden structures and artifacts and those causing mold problems inside the structures are of great concern, and conservation efforts are urgently needed to help preserve these important polar heritage structures. The results presented also expand our knowledge on the identity of fungi present throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region and provide insights into the organisms responsible for decomposition and nutrient recycling.

AB  - Shrub encroachment and soil respiration (SR) are predicted to increase in the tundra ecosystem under climate warming, but little is known regarding potential causal relationships between shrubs and SR at a local scale. Multiple and complex belowground processes exist between the two phenomena, and consolidation is logistically difficult. Our study aimed to identify and integrate multiple belowground processes to elucidate the impact of shrub coverage on SR, using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results indicated that shrub coverage enhanced SR through root biomass, fungal community composition and soil temperature. SEM also revealed a potential indirect effect via interactions among those soil factors. Soil factors relating heterotrophic respiration affected on SR through more complex interaction among the factors. However, total effect sizes on SR were similar between factors relating autotrophic respiration and that relating heterotrophic respiration, suggesting that SR increases with shrub coverage would be unlikely to result from decreases in soil organic matter.

In this study, we introduce the new genus Pseudoxenochalara gen. nov. to the Dermateaceae family, which is supported by morphological observations and multilocus phylogenetic analysis. Partial sequences of the loci encoding beta-tubulin (BenA), ribosomal polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), 28S rDNA (LSU) and internal transcribed spacer rDNA region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) were analysed. This genus comprises one new species, P. grumantiana, isolated from the soil of the Arctic tundra near the settlement of Barentsburg (the Svalbard archipelago). The asexual morph of P. grumantiana was described. The sequences data, as well as the macroand micromorphological characteristics distinguish P. grumantiana from all known species in the Dermateaceae family.

AB  - The fungal communities associated with three bryophytes species (the liverwort Barbilophozia hatcheri, the mosses Chorisodontium aciphyllum and Sanionia uncinata) in the Fildes Region, King George Island, maritime Antarctica, were studied using clone library analysis. Fungal communities showed low diversity; the 680 clones belonged to 93 OTUs. Of these, 78 belonged to the phylum Ascomycota, 13 to the phylum Basidiomycota, 1 to the phylum Zygomycota, and 1 to an unknown phylum. Among the OTUs, the most common orders in the Ascomycota were Helotiales (42 OTUs) and Chaetothyriales (14 OTUs) and the most common orders in the Basidiomycota were Sebacinales (3 OTUs) and Platygloeales (3 OTUs). Most OTUs clustered within clades that contained phylotypes identified from samples in Antarctic or Arctic ecosystems or from bryophytes in other ecosystems. In addition, we found that host-related factor may shape the fungal communities associated with bryophytes in this region. This is the first systematic study of the fungal community in Antarctic bryophytes to be performed using culture-independent method and the results may improve understanding of the endophytic fungal evolution and ecology in the Antarctic ecosystem.

AB  - A strain of Phialocephala fortinii isolated from Luetkea pectinata was used to inoculate axenically grown 1-wk-old Menziesia ferruginea (Ericaceae) seedlings in cellulose agar petri dish cultures. After 3 mo, P. fortinii was observed in cortical cells of whole root mounts. but not in the stele. The fungus produced dark, simple septate hyphae forming extensive wefts on the root surface and intracortical sclerotia consisting of compact masses of darkly pigmented and irregularly lobed, thick-walled hyphae. Isolates of P. fortinii also formed numerous sclerotia in the cellulose agar medium. Presence of P. fortinii caused a ten-fold increase in seedling mortality over controls. Growth rates, based on whole plant fresh weight, were not affected by the presence of P. fortinii. Cenococcum geophilum, Phialocephala dimorphospora, and Phialophora finlandia, which were also used as inoculum for comparative purposes, did not form sclerotia in M. ferruginea. This is the first report to show that the distinct fungus-root associations formed between P.fortinii and subalpine plants can be reproduced consistently in pure culture under laboratory conditions.

AB  - Seven chromate-reducing yeasts isolated from Antarctic soils (with no history of Cr(VI) contamination) were evaluated as promising candidates for alleviating Cr(VI)-contamination. These yeast species have not been extensively studied regarding Cr(VI) tolerance and reduction abilities. Based on their tolerance (up to 2 mM) and ability to remove Cr(VI) from culture media, two representative isolates of Candida sake #14 and Debaryomyces hansenii #35 were chosen. The resistant yeasts were cultivated in YM medium plus 1 mM Cr(VI) at 25 degrees C, causing a removal of similar to 90 and similar to 70% hexavalent chromium before reaching 96 h of culture according to growth curves of C. sake #14 and D. hansenii #35, respectively. Cr(VI) removal kinetic analysis indicated that both isolates removed Cr(VI) by reduction to Cr(III), and incorporated a small portion into the biomass. Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) confirms the biosorption process, indicating the existence of a complex remediation mechanism. In conclusion, Antarctica is an extreme environment with a potential to discover promising new candidates for the removal of Cr(VI). These results are interesting from a biotechnological point of view since psychrotolerant yeasts could be involved in the design of a profitable technology for the elimination of the toxic form of Cr.

AB  - Climate warming is severely affecting high-latitude regions. In the Arctic tundra, it may lead to enhanced soil nutrient availability and interact with simultaneous changes in grazing pressure. It is presently unknown how these concurrently occurring global change drivers affect the root-associated fungal communities, particularly mycorrhizal fungi, and whether changes coincide with shifts in plant mycorrhizal types. We investigated changes in root-associated fungal communities and mycorrhizal types of the plant community in a 10-yr factorial experiment with warming, fertilisation and grazing exclusion in a Finnish tundra grassland. The strongest determinant of the root-associated fungal community was fertilisation, which consistently increased potential plant pathogen abundance and had contrasting effects on the different mycorrhizal fungal types, contingent on other treatments. Plant mycorrhizal types went through pronounced shifts, with warming favouring ecto- and ericoid mycorrhiza but not under fertilisation and grazing exclusion. Combination of all treatments resulted in dominance by arbuscular mycorrhizal plants. However, shifts in plant mycorrhizal types vs fungi were mostly but not always aligned in their magnitude and direction. Our results show that our ability to predict shifts in symbiotic and antagonistic fungal communities depend on simultaneous consideration of multiple global change factors that jointly alter plant and fungal communities.

AB  - In terrestrial ecosystems, plant species and diverse root-associated fungi form complex networks of host-symbiont associations. Recent studies have revealed that structures of those below-ground plant-fungus networks differ between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Nonetheless, we still remain ignorant of how ericaceous plant species, which dominate arctic and alpine tundra, constitute networks with their root-associated fungi. Based on a high-throughput DNA sequencing data set, we characterized the statistical properties of a network involving 16 ericaceous plant species and more than 500 fungal taxa in the alpine-subalpine region of Mt. Tateyama, central Japan. While all the 16 ericaceous species were associated mainly with fungi in the order Helotiales, they varied remarkably in association with fungi in other orders such as Sebacinales, Atheliales, Agaricales, Russulales and Thelephorales. The ericaceous plant-fungus network was characterized by high symbiont/host preferences. Moreover, the network had a characteristic structure called 'anti-nestedness', which has been previously reported in ectomycorrhizal plant-fungus networks. The results lead to the hypothesis that ericaceous plants in harsh environments can host unexpectedly diverse root-associated fungal taxa, constituting networks whose structures are similar to those of previously reported ectomycorrhizal networks but not to those of arbuscular mycorrhizal ones.

AB  - The diversity of filamentous fungi that can grow at high ambient pH values (i.e., 8-11) remains largely understudied. Here we study 100 alkalitolerant and alkaliphilic isolates from the soils around the basin of soda lakes in Asia and Africa to assess the major evolutionary lineages and morphologies pertinent to the alkaliphilic trait in filamentous fungi. The Emericellopsis lineage (Hypocreales, Hypocreomycetidae), along with Plectosphaerellaceae (Hypocreomycetidae), Pleosporaceae (Dothideomycetes), Chaetomiaceae (Sordariomycetidae) families appeared to be overrepresented with strong alkalitolerants and effective alkaliphiles. In particular, Sodiomyces species (Plectosphaerellaceae), Acrostalagmus luteoalbus (Plectosphaerellaceae), Emericellopsis alkalina (Hypocreales), Thielavia sp. (Chaetomiaceae), and Alternaria sect. Soda (Pleosporaceae) grew best at high ambient pH. The pH tolerance of Chordomyces antarcticum, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus and some other species was largely affected by the presence of extra Na+ in the growth medium. Moderate alkalitolerants included Scopulariopsis members (Microascales), Fusarium, Cladosporium, and many asexual acremonium-like species from Bionectriaceae. Weak alkalitolerants were represented by sporadic isolates of Penicillium, Purpureocillium lilacinum, and Alternaria alternata species, with the growth optimum at neutral or acidic pH. Weak alkalitolerants develop loose dry chains of spores easily dispersed by air. Their presence at low frequency with the growth optimum at neutral or acidic pH leads us to treat them as transient species in the alkaline soils, as those are also ubiquitous saprobes in normal soils. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the alkaliphilic trait in filamentous fungi has evolved several times. Several lineages harboring strong alkalitolerants derived from the known marine-borne fungi (Emericellopsis, Alternaria sect. Phragmosporae), or fall within the fungi associated with halophytic grasses (Pleosporaceae). Soda soils contain a diversity of fungi that range from weak alkalitolerant to alkaliphilic, which in few cases is associated with darkly pigmented mycelium and formation of microsclerotia. The alkaliphilic trait is spread throughout the Ascomycota, and usually juxtaposes with slime-covered polyphyletic acremonium-, verticillium-, gliocladium-types of asexual morphology, hyphae aggregating in chords, and enclosed fruit bodies.

AB  - Biotechnologies based on microbial species capable of destroying harmful pollutants are a successful way to solve some of the most important problems associated with a clean environment. The subject of investigation is the Antarctic fungal strain Aspergillus glaucus AL1. The culturing of the examined strain was performed with 70 mg of wet mycelium being inoculated in a Czapek Dox liquid medium containing naphthalene, anthracene, or phenanthrene (0.3 g/L) as the sole carbon source. Progressively decreasing naphthalene and anthracene concentrations were monitored in the culture medium until the 15th day of the cultivation of A. glaucus AL1. The degradation was determined through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both decreased by 66% and 44%, respectively, for this period. The GC-MS analyses were applied to identify salicylic acid, catechol, and ketoadipic acid as intermediates in the naphthalene degradation. The intermediates identified in anthracene catabolism are 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid, o-phthalic acid, and protocatechuic acid. The enzyme activities for phenol 2-monooxygenase (1.14.13.7) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (1.13.11.1) were established. A gene encoding an enzyme with catechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity was identified and sequenced (GeneBank Ac. No KM360483). The recent study provides original data on the potential of an ascomycete's fungal strain A. glaucus strain AL 1 to degrade naphthalene and anthracene.

AB  - The distribution of the fungal biomass and diversity of cultivated microscopic fungi in the profiles of some soils from East (Progress Station, valleys of the Larsemann Hills oasis) and West (Russkaya Station, the Marie Byrd Land) Antarctica regions were studied. The structure of the biomass (spore/mycelium and live cells/dead cells) was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with staining using a set of coloring agents: calcofluor white, ethidium bromide, and fluorescein diacetate. The species composition of the cultivated microscopic fungi was determined on Czapek's medium. The fungal biomass in the soils studied is not high (on the average, 0.3 mg/g of soil); the greatest biomass (0.6 mg/g) was found in the soil samples with plant residues. The fungal biomass is mainly (to 70%) represented by small (to 2.5 mu m) spores. About half of the fungal biomass is composed of living cells. There are differences in the distribution of the fungal biomass within the profiles of different primitive soils. In the soil samples taken under mosses and lichens, the maximal biomass was registered in the top soil horizons. In the soils with the peat horizon under stone pavements, the greatest fungal biomass was registered in the subsurface horizons. Thirty-eight species of cultivated microscopic fungi were isolated from the soils studied. Species of the genus Penicillium and Phoma herbarum predominated.

AB  - The potential for Pythium species to reduce sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) seedling growth and for rhizobia and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi to enhance seedling growth were studied under controlled conditions. Seedling emergence and shoot dry weights of cvs. Nova and Melrose in pasteurized soils infested with each of 18 isolates of Pythium spp. were reduced. Seedlings inoculated with arctic rhizobia grew more rapidly than noninoculated seedlings. Plant growth, nodule dry weight, nitrogenase activity, and mycorrhizal colonization of sainfoin dually inoculated with Rhizobium plus either Glomus fasciculatus or G. intraradices were greater than those of uninoculated plants or those inoculated with either rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungus alone; nitrogen content was higher in plants concomitantly inoculated with Rhizobium plus G. intraradices. Seedling survival and growth in Pythium-infested soil increased for seeds treated with metalaxyl. Interactions of VA mycorrhizal fungi and two isolates of Pythium were investigated under controlled conditions. Shoot dry weights of sainfoin plants inoculated with VA mycorrhizal fungi significantly exceeded those of nonmycorrhizal plants. Seedlings inoculated with VA mycorrhizal fungi had a lower incidence of root rot than non-mycorrhizal ones. This study suggested that a combination of rhizobia, metalaxyl, and VA mycorrhizal fungi could be used to improve the establishment and vigor of sainfoin in Pythium-infested soils.

AB  - Dwarf shrubs of the family Ericaceae are common in arctic and alpine regions. Many of these plants are associated with ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) fungi, which allow them to take nutrients and water from the soil under harsh environmental conditions and, thus, affect host plant survival. Despite the importance of ERM fungi to alpine plant communities, limited information is available on the effects of microhabitat and host identity on ERM fungal communities. We investigated the communities of putative ERM fungi isolated from five dwarf shrub species (Arcterica nana, Diapensia lapponica, Empetrum nigrum, Loiseleuria procumbens, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) that co-occur in an alpine region of Japan, with reference to distinct microhabitats provided by large stone pine (Pinus pumila) shrubs (i.e. bare ground, the edge of stone pine shrubs, and the inside of stone pine shrubs). We obtained 703 fungal isolates from 222 individual plants. These isolates were classified into 55 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the sequencing of internal transcribed spacer regions in ribosomal DNA. These putative ERM fungal communities were dominated by Helotiales fungi for all host species. Cistella and Trimmatostroma species, which have rarely been detected in ERM roots in previous studies, were abundant. ERM fungal communities were significantly different among microhabitats (R-2=0.28), while the host effect explained less variance in the fungal communities after excluding the microhabitat effect (R-2=0.17). Our results suggest that the host effect on ERM fungal communities is minor and the distributions of hosts and fungal communities may be assessed based on microhabitat conditions.

AB  - Soils support a vast amount of carbon (C) that is vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic global change stressors (for example, drought and human-induced nitrogen deposition). However, the simultaneous effects of an increasing number of global change stressors on soil C storage and persistence across ecosystems are virtually unknown. Here, using 1,880 surface soil samples from 68 countries across all continents, we show that increases in the number of global change stressors simultaneously exceeding medium-high levels of stress (that is, relative to their maximum levels observed in nature) are negatively and significantly correlated with soil C stocks and mineral association across global biomes. Soil C is particularly vulnerable in low-productivity ecosystems (for example, deserts), which are subjected to a greater number of global change stressors exceeding medium-high levels of stress simultaneously. Taken together, our work indicates that the number of global change stressors is a crucial factor for soil C storage and persistence worldwide.
   Soil carbon storage is vulnerable to various climatic and anthropogenic global change stressors (for example drought, warming, land-use intensification). Here the authors show that multiple stress factors act simultaneously to reduce soil carbon storage and persistence across global biomes.

AB  - The supply of recent photosynthate from plants to soils is thought to be a critical mechanism regulating the activity and diversity of soil biota. In the Arctic, large-scale vegetation transitions are underway in response to warming, and there is an urgent need to understand how these changes affect soil biodiversity and function. We investigated how abundance and diversity of soil fungi and invertebrates responded to a reduction in fresh below-ground photosynthate supply in treeline birch and willow, achieved using stem girdling. We hypothesised that birch forest would support greater abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal species and fauna than willow shrubs, and that girdling would result in a rapid switch from ECM fungi to saprotrophs as canopy supply of C was cut, with a concomitant decline in soil fauna. Birch forest had greater fungal and faunal abundance with a large contribution of root-associated ascomycetes (ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes) compared to willow shrub plots, which had a higher proportion of saprotrophs and, contrary to our expectations, ECM fungi. Broad-scale soil fungal and faunal functional group composition was not significantly changed by girdling, even in the third year of treatment. Within the ECM community, there were some changes, with genera that are believed to be particularly C-demanding declining in girdled plots. However, it was notable how most ECM fungi remained present after 3 years of isolation of the below-ground compartment from contemporary photosynthate supply. Synthesis. In a treeline/tundra ecosystem, distinct soil communities existed in contrasting vegetation patches within the landscape, but the structure of these communities was resistant to canopy disturbance and concomitant reduction of autotrophic C inputs.

AB  - This paper provides the results of a study on fungal species diversity in the active and permafrost layers of peatlands within frozen peatbogs in the flatland areas of the cryolitozone, European Northeast of Russia (forest-tundra zone, southern and northern tundra subzones). Fungal taxonomic list includes eighty-three species from seventeen genera and two forms of Mycelia sterilia. The phylum Mucoromycota is represented by fifteen species (18% of total isolate number), and these species exhibit the following distribution by genus: Mucor (four), Mortierella (seven), Umbelopsis (three), Podila (one). Ascomycota is represented by sixty-eight species from thirteen genera. The genus Penicillium dominates the species saturation (thirty-seven species, 44%). Soil microfungal complex is represented by rare species (51%), random species (32%), frequent species (15%), and dominant species (2%). In peat soils, dominant species are Penicillium canescens (72%) and non-pigmented (albino) Mycelia sterilia (61%); abundant species are Talaromyces funiculosus (41%), Pseudogymnoascus pannorum (36%), albino Mycelia sterilia (29%), Umbelopsis vinacea (25%), Mortierella alpina (17%), Penicillium decumbens (21%), P. spinulosum (20%), and P. canescens (17%). In active layers of peat soils, abundant species are Penicillium thomii (14%), Mycelia sterilia (13%), Penicillium spinulosum (13%), Penicillium simplicissimum (13%) in forest-tundra; Talaromyces funiculosus (21%), albino Mycelia sterilia (15%), Umbelopsis vinacea (14%) in southern tundra; Penicillium decumbens (23%), P. canescens (17%), P. thomii (13%) in northern tundra. In permafrost peat layers, abundant species are Penicillium spinulosum (17%), Talaromyces funiculosus (34%), and Umbelopsis vinacea (15%) in forest-tundra; Pseudogymnoascus pannorum (30%) and Mortierella alpina (28%) in southern tundra; Pseudogymnoascus pannorum (80%) in northern tundra.

AB  - Cryptoendolithic microbial communities, living in porous sandstone rocks in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Ross Desert) of Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, were found within weathered pegmatite rocks in Northern Victoria Land, and the first endemic Antarctic fungal genus Friedmanniomyces endolithicus anam.- gen. and sp. nov. was isolated from this community. Selected microfungi from these communities and from soil were examined for the production of extracellular enzymes and antibiotic substances. The cryptoendolithic strain CCFEE 5001 was particularly remarkable for consistent glycosidase activity, coupled with barely detectable growth. Chitnase activity was highest in the soil microfungus Verticillium cfr. lecanii (CCFEE 5003). This strain and its purified chitinase were active on Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Aspergillus versicolor, and Penicillium verrucosum, producing mycelial damage and cell lysis. The strain CCFEE 5020, isolated from rocks, showed antibiotic activity against Pseudomonas putida, Sarcina sp., Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli, under the test conditions. Good antibiotic activity was produced in the temperature range of 5 degrees to 25 degrees C, pH 4.0, agitation at 700 rpm, and areation at 1.0 vvm, in media containing 0.5% substrate sugar, though this supported only minimal growth. The investigation of soil microfungi in contrasting sites at the BIOTAS area at Edmonson Point indicated that both the presence of bird colonies and changes in temperature and UV exposure obtained by using plastic cloches influenced species composition and density, A 'Culture Collection of Fungi from Extreme Environments' (CCFEE) has been established at the University of Tuscia, housing fungal strains from Antarctica.

TI  - Involvement of laccase-like enzymes in humic substance degradation by diverse polar soil bacteria
T2  - FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA
LA  - English
AB  - Humic substances (HS) in soil are widely distributed in cold environments and account for a significant fraction of soil's organic carbon. Bacterial strains (n = 281) were isolated at 15 degrees C using medium containing humic acids (HA), a principal component of HS, from a variety of polar soil samples: 217 from the Antarctic and 64 from the Arctic. We identified 73 potential HA-degrading bacteria based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity, and these sequences were affiliated with phyla Proteobacteria (73.9%), Actinobacteria (20.5%), and Bacteroidetes (5.5%). HA-degrading strains were further classified into the genera Pseudomonas (51 strains), Rhodococcus (10 strains), or others (12 strains). Most strains degraded HA between 10 and 25 degrees C, but not above 30 degrees C, indicating cold-adapted degradation. Thirty unique laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) gene fragments were PCR-amplified from 71% of the 73 HA-degrading bacterial strains, all of which included conserved copper-binding regions (CBR) I and II, both essential for laccase activity. Bacterial LMCO sequences differed from known fungal laccases; for example, a cysteine residue between CBR I and CBR II in fungal laccases was not detected in bacterial LMCOs. This suggests a bacterial biomarker role for LMCO to predict changes in HS-degradation rates in tundra regions as global climate changes. Computer-aided molecular modeling showed these LMCOs contain a highly-conserved copper-dependent active site formed by three histidine residues between CBR I and CBR II. Phylogenetic- and modeling-based methods confirmed the wide occurrence of LMCO genes in HA-degrading polar soil bacteria and linked their putative gene functions with initial HS-degradation processes.

AB  - Fossil evidence of a high southern palaeolatitude (approximately 75-78 degrees South) Middle Jurassic (Temaikan) forest from Gondwana is investigated from the Murihiku Supergroup exposed at Kawhia Harbour. North Island, New Zealand. Horizons of fossilised tree stumps, preserved in growth position and rooted within coal-rich layers at bedding contacts, are exposed within cross-bedded medium-grained sandstone on the present-day shore platform. Interbedded siltstone and fine-grained sandstone contain terrestrial palynomorphs, fossilised leaves and other macroflora material (including cones and seeds). The sediments are interpreted as three fluvial facies (vegetated bar top, major sheet flood and channel fill and migration) within a sandy braided river palaeoenvironment. The fossil flora suggest the original vegetation was multi-layered and dominated by gymnosperms and ferns. Lycopods, bryophytes, fungi and algae also grew on the forest floor and in bar top pools. A model of plant communities is presented reflecting changing habitats up the side of interdistributary bars. The model is based on stratigraphically successive taphocenoses within vegetated bar top facies and the preferred growing conditions and life forms of comparable modern relatives. Lycopods and bryophytes on the saturated channel banks became less frequent higher up the bar on the damp, partially drained soil preferred by ferns and cycad trees. Favouring the drier bar top, arborescent gymnosperms thrived around probably ephemeral pools containing lycopods, bryophytes and algae. The characteristics of this fossil forest at Kawhia Harbour compare well to a similar Middle Jurassic site at Curie Bay in South Island, New Zealand, and other high southern palaeolatitude fossil floras from the late Mesozoic. A humid, warm climate with high average annual rainfall and large storms is interpreted from the Kawhia Harbour fossil forest for the New Zealand Middle Jurassic. These palaeoclimatic conditions are comparable to the modern mesothermal zone. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reported data on the diversity and physiological capabilities of fungi inhabiting ice-free outcrops of continental Antarctica are limited. The present study aimed at investigating the occurrence of fungi on fragments of microbial mats on the lakeshore and lake water and compared it with fungal occurrence on terrestrial moss, using a culture-dependent method. Another purpose was to evaluate the responses of hyphal growth to temperature and the profiles of substrate utilization of fungal isolates under pure culture conditions. A total of 46 fungal isolates were obtained and grouped into eight taxa, with Phoma herbarum being the most frequent taxon, the occurrence of which was closely related to the nitrogen level of the substrata. The colony diameter growth rates of most fungal isolates under pure culture conditions increased linearly with temperature to reach the maximum at 20-25 degrees C, indicating that these fungi were mesophilic. Moreover, fungal isolates exhibited diversity and redundancy in their utilization of 71 carbon sources, having potentials to utilize an array of substrates including sugars, sugar alcohols, hexose-phosphates, amino acids, hexose acids, and carboxylic acids.

AB  - Fungi are increasingly recognised as being able to inhabit extreme environments. The deep sea is considered an extreme environment because of its low temperatures, high hydrostatic and lithostatic pressures, 3.5% salinity, and low oxygen, nutrient and light availability. Fungi inhabiting the deep sea may have evolved to produce proteins that allow them to survive these conditions. Investigation and characterisation of fungal lignocellulolytic enzymes from extreme environments like the deep sea is needed, as they may have unusual adaptations that would be useful in industry. This work, therefore, aimed to profile in detail the lignocellulolytic capabilities of fungi isolated from deep-sea sediments in the Atlantic Ocean, and a comparative lignocellulolytic terrestrial isolate. The isolates were strains of Emericellopsis maritima, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. antarcticum and Talaromyces stollii. Lignocellulolytic enzyme induction was achieved using liquid-state fermentation (LSF) with wheat bran as the main carbon source, while enzyme characteristics were evaluated using biochemical assays and gel-based proteomics. This study revealed that the isolates were halotolerant, produced xylanase over wide pH and temperature ranges, and produced a variety of glycoside hydrolase and feruloyl esterase activities. The T. stollii secretome demonstrated remarkable levels of exo-glycoside hydrolase activity, with xylanase activity optimum between pH 1.5-6.0 and temperatures between 1-60 C-degrees, making this isolate an ideal candidate for biotechnological applications. This study is the first to quantitatively characterise xylanase activities and exo-glycoside hydrolase activities secreted by E. maritima, P. antarcticum and a marine T. stollii strain. This study is also the first to quantitatively characterise xylanase activities by a marine strain of P. chrysogenum during LSF.

AB  - The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.

AB  - The fungal microflora of a dry valley in Southern Victoria Land near McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, was investigated.  Samples were collected from introduced objects such as a mummified penguin and spent chewing tobacco in addition to the sparse soil found in rock fissures, isolated moss colonies, shoreline deposit materials, CaCO3 precipitates, and microbial mat debris obtained from the frozen surface of the lake in the basin of Taylor Valley.  Using conventional media and techniques, all collection sites yielded populations of yeasts and filamentous fungi.  Water samples and live microbial mats from beneath the lake ice yielded species of fungi along with an abundance of bacteria.

AB  - Background In the ice-free area of maritime Antarctica, fungi are the essential functioning group in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Until now, no study has been conducted to comprehensively assess fungal communities in various habitats in Antarctica. We aimed to characterize fungal communities in the eleven habitats (i.e., soil, seawater, vascular plant, dung, moss, marine alga, lichen, green alga, freshwater, feather) in the Fildes Region (maritime Antarctica) using next-generation sequencing. Results A total of 12 known phyla, 37 known classes, 85 known orders, 164 known families, 313 known genera, and 320 known species were detected. Habitat specificity rather than habitat overlap determined the composition of fungal communities, suggesting that, although fungal communities were connected by dispersal at the local scale, the environmental filter is a key factor driving fungal assemblages in the ice-free Antarctica. Furthermore, 20 fungal guilds and 6 growth forms were detected. Many significant differences in the functional guild (e.g., lichenized, algal parasite, litter saprotroph) and growth form (e.g., yeast, filamentous mycelium, thallus photosynthetic) existed among different habitat types. Conclusion The present study reveals the high diversity of fungal communities in the eleven ice-free Antarctic habitats and elucidates the ecological traits of fungal communities in this unique ice-free area of maritime Antarctica. The findings will help advance our understanding of fungal diversity and their ecological roles with respect to habitats on a neighbourhood scale in the ice-free area of maritime Antarctica.

AB  - We provide the first assessment of fungal diversity associated with historic wooden structures at Whalers Bay (Heritage Monument 71), Deception Island, maritime Antarctic, using DNA metabarcoding. We detected a total of 177 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) dominated by the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Rozellomycota, and Zoopagomycota. The assemblages were dominated by Helotiales sp. 1 and Herpotrichiellaceae sp. 1. Functional assignments indicated that the taxa detected were dominated by saprotrophic, plant and animal pathogenic, and symbiotic taxa. Metabarcoding revealed the presence of a rich and complex fungal community, which may be due to the wooden structures acting as baits attracting taxa to niches sheltered against extreme conditions, generating a hotspot for fungi in Antarctica. The sequences assigned included both cosmopolitan and endemic taxa, as well as potentially unreported diversity. The detection of DNA assigned to taxa of human and animal opportunistic pathogens raises a potential concern as Whalers Bay is one of the most popular visitor sites in Antarctica. The use of metabarcoding to detect DNA present in environmental samples does not confirm the presence of viable or metabolically active fungi and further studies using different culturing conditions and media, different growth temperatures and incubation periods, in combination with further molecular approaches such as shotgun sequencing are now required to clarify the functional ecology of these fungi.

AB  - We report a previously undescribed member of the Helotiales that is superabundant in soils at two maritime Antarctic islands under Antarctic Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.). High throughput sequencing showed that up to 92% of DNA reads, and 68% of RNA reads, in soils from the islands were accounted for by the fungus. Sequencing of the large subunit region of ribosomal (r)DNA places the fungus close to the Pezizellaceae, Porodiplodiaceae, and Sclerotiniaceae, with analyses of internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA indicating that it has affinities to previously unnamed soil and root fungi from alpine, cool temperate and Low Arctic regions. The fungus was found to be most frequent in soils containing C aged to 1,000-1,200 years before present. The relative abundances of its DNA and RNA reads were positively associated with soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations and delta C-13 values, with the relative abundance of its DNA being negatively associated with soil pH value. An isolate of the fungus produces flask-shaped phialides with a pronounced venter bearing masses of conidia measuring 4.5-6(7) x 1.8-2.5 mu m, suggestive of anamorphic Chalara. Enzymatic studies indicate that the isolate strongly synthesizes the extracellular enzyme acid phosphatase, and also exhibits alkaline phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities. Ecophysiological measurements indicate optimal hyphal growth of the isolate at a pH of 4.2-4.5 and a water potential of -0.66 MPa. The isolate is a psychrotroph, exhibiting measureable hyphal growth at -2 degrees C, optimal hyphal extension rate at 15 degrees C and negligible growth at 25 degrees C. It is proposed that the rising temperatures that are predicted to occur in maritime Antarctica later this century will increase the growth rate of the fungus, with the potential loss of ancient C from soils. Analyses using the GlobalFungi Database indicate that the fungus is present in cold, acidic soils on all continents. We advocate further studies to identify whether it is superabundant in soils under D. antarctica elsewhere in maritime Antarctica, and for further isolates to be obtained so that the species can be formally described.

AB  - Bacterial growth at low pressure is a new research area with implications for predicting microbial activity in clouds and the bulk atmosphere on Earth and for modeling the forward contamination of planetary surfaces like Mars. Here, we describe experiments on the recovery and identification of 20 species of bacterial hypobarophiles (def., growth under hypobaric conditions of approximately 1-2 kPa) in 10 genera capable of growth at 0.7 kPa. Hypobarophilic bacteria, but not archaea or fungi, were recovered from diverse soils, and high numbers of hypobarophiles were recovered from Arctic and Siberian permafrost soils. Isolates were identified through 16S rRNA sequencing to belong to the genera Bacillus, Carnobacterium, Clostridium, Cryobacterium, Exiguobacterium, Paenibacillus, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, and Trichococcus. The highest population of culturable hypobarophilic bacteria (5.1 x 10(4) cfu/g) was recovered from Colour Lake soils from Axel Heiberg Island in the Canadian Arctic. In addition, we extend the number of hypobarophilic species in the genus Serratia to six type-strains that include S. ficaria, S. fonticola, S. grimesii, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, and S. quinivorans. Microbial growth at 0.7 kPa suggests that pressure alone will not be growth-limiting on the martian surface, or in Earth's atmosphere up to an altitude of 34 km.

AB  - Antarctica is a pristine and extreme environment that represents a unique opportunity for taxonomic, ecological and biotechnological studies of the microorganisms. In the present work, the fungal communities of rhizosphere soil of Deschampsia antarctica, soil, ornithogenic soil, marine and lake sediments in the Antarctic Peninsula were characterized as well as their capability to produce bioactive compounds. One hundred fungal isolates were recovered and identified by molecular analysis in 35 different taxa of 20 genera. Pseudogymnoascus sp. 1 and 3, Penicillium sp., Peniophora sp. and Mortierella alpina were the most frequent taxa identified. All isolates were cultured to produce ethanolic extracts, which were assayed against different target organisms to detect antimicrobial (against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis), cytotoxic (against breast MCF-7 and renal TK-10 human tumoral cells) and antiprotozoal (against Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi) activities. Among the three human pathogenic fungal species, 20 extracts showed moderate to high and selective antifungal activity against P. brasiliensis. The extract of Purpureocillium lilacinum displayed high trypanocidal, antifungal and antibacterial activities, but with moderate toxicity over normal cells. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectral analysis indicated the presence of compounds containing a highly functionalized aromatic ring system. Our results suggest that the Antarctic ecosystems represent an interesting habitat for the isolation and characterization of fungal taxa capable to producing bioactive compounds. The fungus P. lilacinum showed strong trypanocidal and antimicrobial activities with moderate toxicity over normal cells, which might be used as scaffold for the development of new drugs.

AB  - The occurrence of fungi in soils of the hot deserts and the dry areas of the Antarctic and Arctic are described. A number of filamentous fungi and yeasts have been documented from both - the hot and cold habitat - however, investigations on the abundance and activity of the filamentous hyphomycetes isolated are still missing. There is striking evidence that many ubiquitous species just survive in hot desert soil by their spores, however, without any physiological activity. There is also reasonable suspicion that man-made contamination of the Antarctic deserts might be the reason for finding a broad distribution of Penicillium and other ubiquitous fungi in soil and air. Basidiomycetous yeasts are reported to be endemic in the dry valley of Antarctica. Unrivaled conquerors of the desert environment are black, microcolonial fungi that are part of the epi- and endolithic community in hot and cold arid and semi-arid habitats. These fungi are one of the most stress-tolerant eukaryotic life forms on Earth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fungal complexes of the coal mine spoil tips around the settlement Barentsburg (Svalbard) were studied. Samples were taken from coal mine spoil tips with different ages (formed, 10-years, 30-years and 50-years). Arctic tundra soils were used as the control. The indicators of change were the species composition, diversity level, dominant groups of species and isolate density of fungal communities. The harsh arctic conditions and the inhospitality of the rock substrate determined the relatively low diversity of microfungi. Only 15 species of microfungi were identified in the samples from formed spoil tip, while in the samples from 50-year-old tip the number of microfungi species increased to 29. The average density of microfungi (CFU/g) for all sampling depths of the coal mine spoil tips was low. But this indicator increased with the age of spoil tips. The density of microfungi isolates also increased with depth in the coal mine spoil tips. The composition of the dominant species of microfungi changed with the age of the spoil tips increased. The convergence of the microfungal complexes of spoil tips and control arctic soils indicates gradual increase stability of mycobiota in disturbed areas.

AB  - Lichens are the symbiotic association of fungi and a photosynthetic partner. However, non-phototrophic bacteria are also present and thought to comprise an essential part of the lichen symbiosis, although their roles in the symbiosis are still poorly understood. In this study, we isolated and characterized 110 non-phototrophic bacterial lichen associates from thalli of the terricolous lichen Peltigera membranacea. The biodegradative and other nutrient-scavenging properties studied among selected isolates were phosphate mobilization, biosurfactant production and degradation of napthalene and several biopolymers, suggesting organic and inorganic nutrient scavenging as roles for bacteria in the lichen symbiotic association. Identification by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the isolates comprised 18 genera within the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, many with high similarities with bacteria typically associated with the plant and rhizosphere environments, could suggest that plants may be important sources of terricolous lichen-associated bacteria, or vice versa.

AB  - Extremophiles are organisms adapted to grow at extreme ranges of environmental variables, such as high or low temperatures, acid or alkaline medium, high salt concentration, high pressures and so forth. Most extremophiles are micro-organisms that belong to the Archaea and Bacteria domains, and are widely spread across the world, which include the polar regions, volcanoes, deserts, deep oceanic sediments, hydrothermal vents, hypersaline lakes, acid and alkaline water bodies, and other extreme environments considered hostile to human life. Despite the tropical climate, Brazil has a wide range of ecosystems which include some permanent or seasonally extreme environments. For example, the Cerrado is a biome with very low soil pH with high Al+3 concentration, the mangroves in the Brazilian coast are anaerobic and saline, Pantanal has thousands of alkaline-saline lakes, the Caatinga arid and hot soils and the deep sea sediments in the Brazilian ocean shelf. These environments harbour extremophilic organisms that, coupled with the high natural biodiversity in Brazil, could be explored for different purposes. However, only a few projects in Brazil intended to study the extremophiles. In the frame of astrobiology, for example, these organisms could provide important models for defining the limits of life and hypothesize about life outside Earth. Brazilian microbiologists have, however, studied the extremophilic micro-organisms inhabiting non-Brazilian environments, such as the Antarctic continent. The experience and previous results obtained from the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) provide important results that are directly related to astrobiology. This article is a brief synopsis of the Brazilian experience in researching extremophiles, indicating the most important results related to astrobiology and some future perspectives in this area.

AB  - Context Soil fungi and bacteria play a crucial role in decomposing soil organic matter (SOM) and providing nutrients to terrestrial ecosystems. However, in polar environments, their relative contributions to decomposition remain unclear.Aims This study aimed to determine whether fungi or bacteria contributes more to humic substances (HS) decomposition (the largest constituent of SOM) in maritime Antarctic soils under controlled laboratory conditions with elevated temperature and moisture levels.Methods Soil culturing method was used to select for soil microbes that efficiently degrade HS. During culturing at 18 degrees C for 30 days, Antarctic soils were treated with selective antimicrobials to manipulate microbial communities. After culturing, HS degradation and bacterial communities were analysed. The effects of soil culturing on plant growth were also evaluated using Arabidopsis thaliana as a surrogate for Antarctic plants.Key results HS decomposition and solubilisation were more pronounced in antifungal-treated soils compared to antibacterial-treated soils. Antifungal treatment reduced bacterial alpha diversity, altered bacterial composition, and increased the abundance of rhizosphere-associated Saccharibacteria. Bacterial growth resumed quickly after antibacterial treatment indicating resilience to antimicrobials. Soil culturing resulted in a higher water-soluble HS fraction, which significantly enhanced the fresh and dry weights of A. thaliana.Conclusions Antarctic bacteria exhibit higher degradative activity and resilience to antimicrobials compared to fungi, promoting HS decomposition and solubilisation. This indicates that bacteria have a greater impact on Antarctic soil functioning than fungi.Implications These findings highlight the critical role of bacteria in nutrient cycling and plant growth in polar ecosystems.

AB  - A recent study identified a fungal isolate from the Antarctic leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians as the ericoid mycorrhizal associate Rhizoscyphus ericae. However, nothing is known about the wider Antarctic distribution of R. ericae in C. varians, and inoculation experiments confirming the ability of the fungus to form coils in the liverwort are lacking.
   Using direct isolation and baiting with Vaccinium macrocarpon seedlings, fungi were isolated from C. varians sampled from eight sites across a 1875-km transect through sub- and maritime Antarctica. The ability of an isolate to form coils in aseptically grown C. varians was also tested.
   Fungi with 98-99% sequence identity to R. ericae internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and partial large subunit ribosomal (r)DNA sequences were frequently isolated from C. varians at all sites sampled. The EF4/Fung5 primer set did not amplify small subunit rDNA from three of five R. ericae isolates, probably accounting for the reported absence of the fungus from C. varians in a previous study. Rhizoscyphus ericae was found to colonize aseptically-grown C. varians intracellularly, forming hyphal coils.
   This study shows that the association between R. ericae and C. varians is apparently widespread in Antarctica, and confirms that R. ericae is at least in part responsible for the formation of the coils observed in rhizoids of field-collected C. varians.

AB  - Cold-active catalase (CAT) elicits great interest because of its vast prospective at the medical, commercial, and biotechnological levels. The study paper reports the production of cold-active CAT by the strain Penicillium griseofulvum P29 isolated from Antarctic soil. Improved enzyme production was achieved by optimization of medium and culture conditions. Maximum CAT was demonstrated under low glucose content (2%), 10% inoculum size, temperature 20 degrees C, and dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) 40%. An effective laboratory technology based on changing the oxidative stress level through an increase of DO in the bioreactor was developed. The used strategy resulted in a 1.7- and 1.4-fold enhanced total enzyme activity and maximum enzyme productivity. The enzyme was purified and characterized. P. griseofulvum P29 CAT was most active at approximately 20 degrees C and pH 6.0. Its thermostability was in the range between 5 degrees C and 40 degrees C.

AB  - A total of 969 microbial strains were isolated from soil samples and tested to determine their lipolytic activity by employing screening techniques on solid and in liquid media. Ten lipase-producing microorganisms were selected and their taxonomic identification was carried out. From these strains Achremonium murorum, Monascus mucoroides, Arthroderma ciferri, Fusarium poae, Ovadendron sulphureo-ochraceum and Rhodotorula araucariae are described as lipase-producers for the first time. Hydrolysis activity of the crude lipases against both tributyrin and olive oil was measured. Heptyl oleate synthesis was carried out to test the activity of the selected lipases as biocatalysts in organic medium. All the selected lipases were tested as biocatalysts in several organic reactions using unnatural substrates. Lipases from the fungi Fusarium. oxysporum and O. sulphurco-ochraceum gave the best yields and enantioselectivities in the esterification of carboxylic acids. F: oxysporum and Penicillium chrysogenum lipases were the most active ones for the acylation of alcohols without steric hindrance. A. murorum lipase is very useful for the esterification of menthol. F: oxysporum and Fusarium. solani lipases were very stereoselective in the synthesis of carbamates. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extreme weather conditions in the Antarctic have exerted selective pressures favoring differential features in bacteria to survive this untapped environment (i.e., antibiotic molecules). Notably, higher chances of antibiotic discovery from extremophiles have been proposed recently. Although new organic and environmentally friendly sources for helping in the control of plant pathogenic fungi are necessary, the information about anti-phytopathogenic applications of extremophile microorganisms from untapped environments is limited. In this study, we determined the antifungal effect of actinobacterial strains isolated from Antarctic soils and sediments. Co-culture inhibition assays and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) determination revealed that all Antarctic strains (x28) can inhibit the growth of at least one phytopathogenic fungi including Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis sp. and Phytophthora infestans. Additionally, new novel antagonistic relationships are reported. Our work establishes a precedent on Antarctic actinobacteria strains with the capacity to produce antifungal compounds, and its potential for developing new fungicides or biocontrol agents solving current agriculture problems.

AB  - Primary succession and microtopography result in environmental changes and are important processes influencing the community assembly of soil fungi in the Arctic region. In glacier forefields that contain a series of moraine ridges, both processes contribute synchronously to fungal spatial diversity. To reveal the synergistic effects of succession and microtopography, we investigated the fungal community structure and environmental variables in the moraines of the Arklio Glacier, Ellesmere Island. The study sites were established at four locations from the top to the bottom of the ridge slope within each of the three moraine ridges of different post-glacial ages. The location-dependent community composition was equally diverse in both the initial and later stages of succession, suggesting that successional time could alter the effects of microtopography on the fungal community. Moreover, our results suggest that fungal communities at different locations follow different successional trajectories, even if they have passed through the same time lapse. Such a synergistic effect of succession and microtopography of moraines does not allow for parallel changes in fungal communities among moraines or among locations, suggesting that the moraine series contributes substantially to fungal spatial diversity in the glacier forefield.

AB  - The Polish Arctowski Station is situated in the maritime Antarctic on the western shore of Admiralty Bay and encompasses terrestrial habitats which are not permanently covered by ice, in contrast to more than 90% of the island's surface area. Over the past several decades, studies exploring the soils of those habitats have revealed a considerable diversity of bacteria, filamentous fungi, and, to a lesser extent, yeasts; however, characterization of this complex microbiome, especially at the molecular level, is still far from satisfactory. The isolates were assigned to their respective genera and species based on genetic analysis of the D1/D2 and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions of rDNA. In the studied soil samples, the most abundant microorganisms belonged to the genera Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, and Debaryomyces. Physiological and biochemical analysis of Cryptococcus gilvescens (pro tempore Goffeauzyma gilvescens) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa showed only a limited level of intraspecies diversity. Cellular DNA content and karyotypes were determined using flow cytometry and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for several selected strains. For the first time, genome size and electrophoretic karyotypes were investigated in C. gilvescens (pro tem G. gilvescens), Cryptococcus saitoi (pro tem Naganishia globosa), Cryptococcus gastricus (pro tem Goffeauzyma gastrica), and Cryptococcus albidus (pro tem Naganishia albida). In addition, plate tests showed Antarctic yeasts to be a potential source of biotechnologically important enzymes. This study in biodiversity, presenting physiological and molecular characterization of psychrotolerant yeast strains isolated from the soils of western Admiralty Bay, contributes to a better understanding of the microbial ecology of this unique ecosystem.

AB  - Oman is a desert country in the south of the Middle East. Springs and other water sources that harbor aquatic organisms can be separated by hundreds of kilometers. In Oct 2019, we isolated four freshwater aquatic fungi (Chytridiomycota) from benthic detritus baited with pine pollen on a general nutrient medium near Salalah, Oman. Database queries of nuc 28S rRNA (28S) and internal transcribed spacer region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) revealed that one of these strains wasDinochytrium kinnereticum, a recently described algal pathogen from the Sea of Galilee. The other three strains had low molecular identity to available ITS sequences. These unknown strains varied in size and released endogenously swarming zoospores through papillae from mature zoosporangia. Zoospore ultrastructure was consistent with described species in the Rhizophydiales, and molecular phylogenetic results grouped these three strains into a clade in the genusRhizophydium. We circumscribe these three strains as a sp. nov., thereby expanding the diversity withinRhizophydiumdescribed as the new speciesR. jobii. In doing so, we provide the first report of Chytridiomycota from Oman.

AB  - We tested the preferences of three nematode taxa, Geomonhystera villosa, Plectus spp. and Teratocephalus spp., extracted from moss at Signy Island in the Maritime Antarctic, for two microalgae, three microfungi and six heterotrophic bacteria, each also from soils at Signy Island. Choice test experiments on water agar medium, in which nematodes were enumerated in wells containing microbes at 24 and 48 h, indicated that there were differing preferences between nematodes for distinct prey. G. villosa was significantly attracted to the alga Chlorella cf. minutissima and the fungus Mortierella hyalina, and was more attracted to all algae and fungi than either of the other two nematodes. Both G. villosa and Teratocephalus spp. were attracted to an actinobacterium. Plectus spp. were significantly attracted to the alga Stichococcus bacillaris and bacteria with close taxonomic affinities to Arthrobacter Pseudomonas and Polaromonas. Experiments using 0.5 mum diameter fluorescent beads indicated significantly increased ingestion by nematodes in the presence of each of these microbes compared with controls, except by Plectus spp. in the presence of S. bacillaris. We conclude that complex trophic interactions may occur in apparently simple Antarctic soil food webs. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ability of actinomycete strains newly isolated from Antarctic soils to produce keratinolytic enzymes during growth on sheep wool waste was investigated. The strains which displayed highest keratinase activity and identified as Streptomyces flavis 2BG (mesophilic) and Microbispora aerata IMBAS-11A (thermophilic) were selected for a more detailed analysis. The addition of starch to the growth medium affected keratinase secretion by both strains. After 5 days of cultivation, a 6-fold increase in keratinase activity of strain 11A was observed in the presence of 11 g starch/l and a 9-fold increase in keratinase activity of the strain 2BG in the presence of 5 g starch/l. The results obtained showed that both newly isolated strains are very promising for effective processing of native keratinous wastes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Antarctic actinomycete strains that were able to grow on keratin-containing wastes by producing keratinolytic enzymes.

AB  - The methanolysis of soybean oil to produce a fatty acid methyl ester (ME, i.e., biodiesel fuel) was catalyzed by lipase-producing filamentous fungi immobilized on biomass support particles (BSPs) as a whole-cell biocatalyst in the presence of ionic liquids. We used four types of whole-cell biocatalysts: wildtype Rhizopus oryzae producing triacylglycerol lipase (w-ROL), recombinant Aspergillus oryzae expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL), Candida antarctica lipase B (r-CALB), and mono- and diacylglycerol lipase from A. oryzae (r-mdlB). w-ROL gave the high yield of fatty acid methyl ester (ME) in ionic liquid [Emim][BF4] or [Bmim][BF4] biphasic systems following a 24h reaction. While lipases are known to be severely deactivated by an excess amount of methanol (e.g. 1.5 Mequiv. of methanol against oil) in a conventional system, methanolysis successfully proceeded even with a methanol/oil ratio of 4 in the ionic liquid biphasic system, where the ionic liquids would work as a reservoir of methanol to suppress the enzyme deactivation. When only w-ROL was used as a biocatalyst for methanolysis, unreacted monoglyceride remained due to the 1,3-positional specificity of R. oryzae lipase. High ME conversion was attained by the combined use of two types of whole-cell biocatalysts, w-ROL and r-mdlB. In a stability test, the activity of w-ROL was reduced to one-third of its original value after incubation in [Bmim][BF4] for 72 h. The stability of w-ROL in [Bmim][BF4] was greatly enhanced by cross-linking the biocatalyst with glutaraldehyde. The present Study demonstrated that ionic liquids are promising candidates for use as the second solvent in biodiesel fuel production by whole-cell biocatalysts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from Antarctic ecosystems and to assess its potential antibacterial activity on Xanthomonas euvesicatoria and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. passiflorae (phytopathogenic bacteria causing diseases in pepper and tomato and passionfruit, respectively). Among the 66 crude intracellular and extracellular extracts obtained from fungi recovered from soil and 79 obtained from marine sediment samples, 25 showed the ability to prevent the growth of X. euvesicatoria invitro and 28 showed the ability to prevent the growth of X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae invitro. Intracellular and extracellular extracts from soil fungi inhibited around 97% of X. euvesicatoria and 98% of X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae at 2.1 mg ml(-1). The average inhibition rates against X. euvesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae for intracellular and extracellular extracts from marine sediments fungi were around 96 and 97%, respectively, at 3.0 mg ml(-1). Extracts containing secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. euvesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae were obtained, containing possible substitutes for the products currently used to control these phytopathogens.

AB  - In Iceland, extensive afforestation programmes have been initiated, often involving the outplanting of nursery seedling stock on eroded land. In some areas high seedling mortality, to a large extent due to root damage caused by Otiorhynchus spp. larvae, has been reported. Even though recent studies have shown that inoculation with entomopathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi may reduce the effects of Otiorhynchus spp. on seedling mortality, information on the occurrence and distribution of these key fungal species in Icelandic soils is limited. The present study reports findings of a targeted survey on the occurrence and distribution of entomopathogenic fungi and birch (Betula pubescens) root symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in Icelandic soils from key habitats representing birch woodland, heathland and degraded/eroded land. Entomopathogenic fungi were isolated from soil by baiting with Tenebrio molitor and Galleria mellonella larvae. Identification to species was achieved based on standard morphotyping of cultures that included conidiophores and conidia. Birch seedling root symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungal distribution in eroded and birch woodland soil was determined following baiting with birch seedlings over 9 months and classification based on gross morphology. Significant lower frequency and diversity of both entomopathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi were detected in soil collected from eroded areas compared to soil from vegetated areas (birch and heathland). Three species of entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae and Isaria farinosa were present in soil samples collected from the birch woodland and heathland sites. In contrast, no insect pathogenic fungi were found in soil collected from the eroded sites. B. bassiana and M. anisopliae were recorded for the first time in Iceland. The incidence of mycorrhizal root tips was higher on seedlings grown in soil from birch woodland than in soil from eroded land and a higher diversity of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was found in birch soil. The importance of these findings is discussed in relation to afforestation in Iceland.

AB  - Marine fungi remain poorly covered in global genome sequencing campaigns; the 1000 fungal genomes (1KFG) project attempts to shed light on the diversity, ecology and potential industrial use of overlooked and poorly resolved fungal taxa. This study characterizes the genomes of three marine fungi: Emericellopsis sp. TS7, wood-associated Amylocarpus encephaloides and algae-associated Calycina marina. These species were genome sequenced to study their genomic features, biosynthetic potential and phylogenetic placement using multilocus data. Amylocarpus encephaloides and C. marina were placed in the Helotiaceae and Pezizellaceae (Helotiales), respectively, based on a 15-gene phylogenetic analysis. These two genomes had fewer biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) than Emericellopsis sp. TS7 isolate. Emericellopsis sp. TS7 (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) was isolated from the sponge Stelletta normani. A six-gene phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in the marine Emericellopsis clade and morphological examination confirmed that the isolate represents a new species, which is described here as E. atlantica. Analysis of its CAZyme repertoire and a culturing experiment on three marine and one terrestrial substrates indicated that E. atlantica is a psychrotrophic generalist fungus that is able to degrade several types of marine biomass. FungiSMASH analysis revealed the presence of 35 BGCs including, eight non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), six NRPS-like, six polyketide synthases, nine terpenes and six hybrid, mixed or other clusters. Of these BGCs, only five were homologous with characterized BGCs. The presence of unknown BGCs sets and large CAZyme repertoire set stage for further investigations of E. atlantica. The Pezizellaceae genome and the genome of the monotypic Amylocarpus genus represent the first published genomes of filamentous fungi that are restricted in their occurrence to the marine habitat and form thus a valuable resource for the community that can be used in studying ecological adaptions of fungi using comparative genomics.

AB  - Eighteen taxa of terrestrial predacious fungi (nematode-trapping species and endozoic parasites of nematodes) are reported from the maritime Antarctic (15 taxa from Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, and 10 taxa from Galindez Island, Argentine Islands [Monacrosporium ellipsosporum (Preuss), (Grove), Cooke and Dickinson, M. cionopagum (Drechsler), (Subramanian), Cooke and Dickinson, M. lypsipagum (Drechsler), Cooke and Dickinson, M. psychrophilum (Drechsler), Cooke and Dickinson, Dactylaria gracilis Duddington, D. candida (Nees), Sace, (Drechsler), Dactylella phymatopaga Drechsler, D. stenobrocha Drechsler, ?Cystopage lateralis Drechsler, Harposporium anguillulae (Lohde), Karling, H. oxycoracum Drechsler, H. lilliputanum Dixon, Meria coniospora Drechsler, Acrostalagmus obovatus Drechsler, Haptoglossa heterospora Dreschler, Cephalosporium balanoides Drechsler, unidentified species a and unidentified species b. [Of the 15 identified species only M. coniospora was previously confirmed from the Antarctic.] Fifteen are positively identified to species level, 12 of which have not previously been recorded in the Antarctic. They were isolated from several locally dominant moss species and soil associated with the 2 native phanerogams. Monacrosporium ellipsosporum and M. cionopagum were the most widely distributed trapping hypomycetes while Harposporium anguillulae was the most frequently occurring endozoic fungus. All taxa were isolated from cultures maintained at 18.5.degree. C but only 5 of these were recorded in cultures kept at 7.degree. C. Eight different trapping mechanisms were recorded with adhesive knobs being the commonest structure. The relationship between fungal taxon and moss species or soil type is discussed. Although several species were recorded only in single samples M. ellipsosporum appeared associated with calcicolous mosses. M. cionopagum and H. anguillulae have comparatively wide ecological amplitudes. No nematophagous fungi were isolated from permanently saturated moss carpets or from the strongly acidic turf-forming Polytrichaceae. The possible importance of these fungi in the energy dynamics and their influence on nematode populations of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems is considered.

AB  - Whillans Subglacial Lake (SLW) lies beneath 801 m of ice in the lower portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part of an extensive and active subglacial drainage network. Here, the geochemical characterization of SLW rare earth elements (REE), trace elements (TE), free amino acids (FAA), and phenolic compounds (PC) measured in lakewater and sediment porewater are reported. The results show, on average, higher values of REEs in the lakewater than in the porewater, and clear changes in all REE concentrations and select redox sensitive trace element concentrations in porewaters at a depth of similar to 15 cm in the 38 cm lake sediment core. This is consistent with prior results on the lake sediment redox conditions based on gas chemistry and microbiological data. Low concentrations of vanillyl phenols were measured in the SLW water column with higher concentrations in porewater samples and their concentration profiles in the sediments may also reflect changing redox conditions in the sediments. Vanillin concentrations increased with depth in the sediments as oxygenation decreases, while the concentrations of vanillic acid, the more oxidized component, were higher in the more oxygenated surface sediments. Collectively these results indicate redox changes occurring with the upper 38 cm of sediment in SLW and provide support for the existence of a seawater source, already hypothesized, in the sediments below the lowest measured depth, and of a complex and dynamic geochemical system beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
   Our results are the first to detail geochemical properties from an Antarctic subglacial environment using direct sampling technology. Due to their isolation from the wider environment, subglacial lakes represent one of our planets last pristine environments that provide habitats for microbial life and natural biogeochemical cycles but also impact the basal hydrology and can cause ice flow variations.

AB  - In this study, we propose a new genus, Victoriomyces, with a new species, Victoriomyces antarcticus, isolated from soil samples collected in Victoria Land, Antarctica. To determine its taxonomic status and evolutionary relationships, phylogenetic analysis was performed on DNA sequences from the nuclear 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) genes. Victoriomyces antarcticus constitutes one well-supported distinct lineage within the Cephalothecaceae (family incertae sedis in Sordariomycetes), in which the only recognised asexual morphs belong to the genus Phialemonium and to Acremonium thermophilum. Victoriomyces antarcticus can be clearly distinguished from these taxa by means of DNA sequence analysis and its morphological traits that consist in having a Metarhizium-like asexual morph, dark red-coloured disk-like structures, immature bodies and the production of an intense red pigment in the growth media. Finally, we inferred the divergence time of V. antarcticus and the Cephalothecaceae using Bayesian analysis and secondary calibration. The holotype of V. antarcticus is FBL 165. The ex-type strain has been deposited as MUT 3686(T) and CCF 6158(T). An additional strain of the species is FBL 577. The MycoBank number is MB 823713 for the genus and MB 823714 for the species.

AB  - Cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces are ice-cold hot spots of microbial diversity and activity but still little is known about their fungal inhabitants. We provide the first report of distinctive fungal communities in cryoconite debris from three valley glaciers at Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Multivariate analysis of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of rRNA ITS amplicons revealed that quite distinct fungal communities were found in cryoconite holes compared with soils from adjacent moraine and tundra sites, and that communities on glaciers with contrasting ice-surface hydrology also differed. Most of the fungi cultured from cryoconite sediment were basidiomycetous yeasts or filamentous Ascomycota (Helotiales/Pleosporales). The latter included aeroaquatic fungi, such as Articulospora and Varicosporium, implying a role for these important freshwater decomposers in the carbon dynamics of cryoconite holes. Matching of the dominant peaks from T-RFLP analysis to predicted peaks of cultured isolates confirmed the abundance of these aeroaquatic fungi but also revealed that most of the dominant T-RFLP peaks did not match any cultured isolates. Considering the prevalence and endangerment of glacial environments worldwide, these findings would suggest that their potential as reservoirs of fungal diversity should not be overlooked.

AB  - Microbial communities inhabiting the Antarctic Ocean show psychrophilic and halophilic adaptations conferring interesting properties to the enzymes they produce, which could be exploited in biotechnology and bioremediation processes. Use of cold- and salt-tolerant enzymes allows to limit costs, reduce contaminations, and minimize pretreatment steps. Here, we report on the screening of 186 morphologically diverse microorganisms isolated from marine biofilms and water samples collected in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) for the identification of new laccase activities. After primary screening, 13.4 and 10.8% of the isolates were identified for the ability to oxidize 2,2 '-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and the dye azure B, respectively. Amongst them, the marine Halomonas sp. strain M68 showed the highest activity. Production of its laccase-like activity increased six-fold when copper was added to culture medium. Enzymatic activity-guided separation coupled with mass spectrometry identified this intracellular laccase-like protein (named Ant laccase) as belonging to the copper resistance system multicopper oxidase family. Ant laccase oxidized ABTS and 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, working better at acidic pHs The enzyme showed a good thermostability, with optimal temperature in the 40-50 degrees C range and maintaining more than 40% of its maximal activity even at 10 degrees C. Furthermore, Ant laccase was salt- and organic solvent-tolerant, paving the way for its use in harsh conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report concerning the characterization of a thermo- and halo-tolerant laccase isolated from a marine Antarctic bacterium.

AB  - The dictyostelids (also called cellular slime molds or social amoebae) are among the more abundant and widespread groups of microorganisms in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this fact, they are totally unknown to most people, who sometimes confuse the dictyostelids with myxomycetes (or plasmodial slime molds). The first dictyostelid (Dictyostelium mucoroides) was described by the German Oskar Brefeld in 1869. More than 180 species are now known, and these organisms have been recorded from the high arctic to the subantarctic. The primary microhabitat for dictyostelids is the soil/humus layer on a forest floor, but they also occur in a number of other microhabitats. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of dictyostelids, including their occurrence, distribution, relationships with other organisms, methods used for isolation, history of their study, and classification. The assemblages of species associated with each major type of ecosystem (tropical forest, temperate forest, boreal forest, tundra, grassland, savanna, and desert) are described. In addition, the compounds produced by dictyostelids and their possible applications are discussed.

AB  - Proteomics has been used extensively in the field of mycology, mainly in trying to understand the complex network of protein-protein interactions that has been implicated in the molecular functions of fungi. It is also a useful tool to compare metabolic differences within a genus. Species of Pseudogymnoascus, a genus under the phyla Ascomycota, have been shown to play an important role in the soil environment. They have been found in both polar and temperate regions and are a known producer of many extracellular hydrolases that contribute to soil decomposition. Despite the apparent importance of Pseudogymnoascus spp. in the soil ecosystem, investigations into their molecular functions are still very limited. In the present study, proteomic characterization of six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolated from three biogeographic regions (the Arctic, Antarctic, and temperate regions) was carried out using tandem mass spectrometry. Prior to proteomic analysis, the optimization for protein extraction was carried out. Trichloroacetic acid-acetone-phenol was found to be the best extraction method to be used for proteomic profiling of Pseudogymnoascus spp. The proteomic analysis identified 2003 proteins that were successfully mapped to the UniProtKB database. The identified proteins were clustered according to their biological processes and molecular functions. The shared proteins found in all Pseudogymnoascus spp. (1201 proteins) showed a significantly close relationship in their basic cellular functions, despite differences in morphological structures. Analysis of Pseudogymnoascus spp. proteome also identified proteins that were unique to each region. However, a high number of these proteins belonged to protein families of similar molecular functions, namely, transferases and hydrolases. Our proteomic data can be used as a reference for Pseudogymnoascus spp. across different global regions and a foundation for future soil ecosystem function research.

AB  - Purpose The ecological importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in plant acquisition of inorganic and organic sources of nitrogen (N) is not clear. To improve understanding of the plant N nutrition ecology, we tested the effect of intraspecific competition and AMF in plant N source use in growth and N acquisition.
   Methods Solidago virgaurea was grown in microcosms in a fully factorial experiment under greenhouse conditions. The factors tested were intraspecific competition between seedlings and adult plants (yes, no), N source (NH4, glycine) and AMF (inoculated with Glomus hoi, not inoculated).
   Results When grown separately, non-mycorrhizal seedling growth was highest when grown with ammonium, but non-mycorrhizal adults grew best with glycine as the sole N source. Mycorrhizal symbiosis with Glomus hoi evened out this initial niche partitioning in terms of differences in N source use and all mycorrhizal plants grew best with ammonium. Competition shaped plant benefit from mycorrhizal symbiosis depending on the N source. Competition reduced mycorrhizal growth benefit in glycine-grown seedlings, but not in adults. Plant performance did not show uniform relationship with delta N-15, but delta N-15 was affected by life stage, competition and mycorrhiza.
   Conclusions Plant competition and AMF shape plant N source use. Plant and AMF benefit of the symbiosis depend on the N source.

AB  - Antarctica is one of the most inhospitable continents on the planet, with lichens and mosses being the most common terrestrial organisms in ice-free areas. Antarctica is represented by only two species of Angiosperms, Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) and Colobanthus quitensis (Kunth) Bartl. (Caryophyllaceae). In this study, we characterized fungi isolated from the fresh leaves of this grass species. The fungi were isolated from four individual plants from Half Moon Island (246 leaf fragments investigated), and seven from King George Island-Keller Peninsula (with 111 leaf fragments investigated) Antarctica. Neoascochyta paspali, Septoriella elongata, Pyrenophora cf. chaetomioides and Alternaria sp. were associated with the plant and identified through analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the rDNA and nuclear ribosomal large subunit rRNA gene (LSU) as well as through macro and micro-morphological characteristics. The isolates showed higher growth rate ranging from 10 to 20 degrees C. An interesting result was that the aforementioned fungi are already recognized as both plant pathogens and endophytic fungi. The results demonstrate that D. antarctica is an interesting fungal source. Those species might provide important information about the relationship on the endemic Antarctic biota.

AB  - Studies of Antarctic eukaryotes have been hampered by their morphological conservatism, small size and the logistical constraints of remote field work, resulting in a deficiency of baseline biodiversity information about Antarctic terrestrial environments. The application of high throughput sequencing (HTS) in metataxonomic approaches is a promising alternative. Here, we apply such HTS approaches to the hitherto largely unsurveyed micro-eukaryote fauna of the Prince Charles Mountains, East Antarctica. We sequenced 18S rDNA amplicons of twelve Antarctic bulk-soil DNA extracts, retrieved from three sampling regions (four bulk-soil extracts per sampling region). After isolating eukaryotic phylotypes with a stringent filtering approach and initial network visualization, we firstly used rarefied data to compare four alpha diversity metrics between the three regions. Weighted and unweighted inter-sample UniFrac distances were then used for beta diversity comparisons among rarefied data. Furthermore, we analysed the distribution of the most abundant phylotypes and phylotype groups. Lastly, we checked the validity of species-level taxonomic assignments using different sets of reference data in conjunction with two different taxonomy assignment approaches. Phylotype numbers in un-rarefied data compared across regions were lowest for Mount Menzies (73 degrees S; 3330 m), intermediate at Mawson Escarpment (73 degrees S; 807 m) and highest at Lake Terrasovoje (70 degrees S; 173 m), likely due to low biological load at the higher latitude and elevation inland sites. Analysis of rarefied data was difficult due to low sequence coverage particularly from Mount Menzies, but indicated differences in Shannon diversity between Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje. PCoA of weighted UniFrac distances between samples from Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje indicated changes in community composition in relation to elevation of the sampling locations. The most widespread phylotypes were fungal, followed by non-algal protists. Species-level assignments included known Antarctic taxa in all sampling regions. We show that HIS can provide a rapid survey of the micro-eukaryote fauna to provide baseline biodiversity information for remote, harsh, and hitherto largely unsurveyed environments in the Prince Charles Mountains.

AB  - This study assessed the diversity and distribution of filamentous fungi obtained from water sampled from six lakes in the Antarctic Peninsula. One hundred and twenty-eight fungal isolates were purified and identified by analysis of nuclear rDNA ITS region sequences as belonging to 31 fungal different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most frequently isolated fungi were Geomyces pannorum and Mortierella sp.; these species occurred in six and three of the lakes sampled, respectively, and displayed the highest total colony-forming unit per L. Different species that have not been found to these lakes and/or had adapted to cold conditions were found. In general, the fungal community displayed low richness and high dominance indices. The species Cadophora cf. luteo-olivacea, Cadophora malorum, Davidiella tassiana, G.pannorum, Mortierella cf. alpina and Thelebolus cf. microsporus that were found in the lakes in question were also previously found in other cold ecosystems, such as Arctic, temperate and Alpine regions. The results of this study suggest the presence of an interesting aquatic fungal web, including symbionts, weak and strong saprophytes and parasite/pathogen fungal species. This aquatic web fungal may be a useful community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies of extreme habitats.

AB  - Since the discovery of penicillin, fungi have been an important source of bioactive natural products. However, as a specific resource, the bioactive potentiality and specificity of fungal metabolites from the Antarctic region have had little attention. In this paper, we investigated the diversity patterns and biological activities of cultivable fungi isolated from soil samples in Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. Fungal communities showed low abundance and diversity; a total of 150 cultivable fungi were isolated from eight soil samples. After being dereplicated by morphological characteristics and chemical fingerprints, 47 fungal isolates were identified by ITS-rDNA sequencing. We confirmed that these isolates belonged to at least 11 different genera and clustered into nine groups corresponding to taxonomic orders in the phylogenetic analysis. Using two different fermentation conditions, 94 crude extracts acquired from the abovementioned different metabolite characteristic isolates were screened by bioactivity assay and 18 isolates produced biologically active compounds. Compared with HPLC-DAD-UV fingerprint analysis of culture extracts and standard compounds, two bioactive components secalonic acid and chetracins were identified. Our research suggests that the abundance and diversity of Antarctic cultivable fungal communities exhibit unique ecological characteristics and potential producers of novel natural bioactive products.

T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY

AB  - A microbiological survey of 40 soils from contaminated and pristine localities of Mawson Base or the Vestfold Hills (Davis Base) is described. High microbial populations (from 106 to in excess of 109 cells g-1 dry soil) were associated with soil contaminated by man or animals, soil from beneath a moss bed, or soil from beneath translucent quartz pebbles and containing green algae. Lower microbial populations (generally between 104-106 cells g-1 soil) were associated with pristine soils  lacking an identifiable primary producer. No correlation was evident between population density and soil particle size, moisture content, pH or salinity as determined by the electrical conductivity (E.C.) of soil suspensions, although relationships were evident between the components of the microflora and E.C. Microbial groups asssociated with low E.C. were chitinolytic bacteria, fungi and green algae; favored by high E.C. were halotolerant bacteria. The microflora of uncontaminated soils appeared to be dominated by Gram-negative aerobic rods (68% of the total flora) with Moraxella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas being the most frequently isolated genera. The remaining microflora comprised Gram-positive pleomorphic bacteria (mainly coryneforms), 13%; filamentous Gram-negative aerobic rods (morphologically akin to Bacillus species), 12%; and yeasts, 7%. Streptomyces was identified among the dominant microflora of only one soil. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were never isolated, although their presence was indicated in 40% of the soils tested by acetylene-reduction assay. Anaerobes were not detected in any soil using dilution-plate techniques, but were occasionally detected by enrichment in semi-solid media. All of 242 isolates obtained at 10.degree. incubation were able to grow at 15.degree., 3.3% failed to grow at 18.degree. and a further 9.5% failed to growth at 25.degree.. Of 304 isolates obtained on one-tenth strength Trypticase-Soy agar (0.05% nutrient concentration), 10% failed to grow  on the full-strength medium. Soils from the vicinity of Mawson or Davis bases contained a variety of fungi (Cladosporium, Chrysosporium, Acremonium, Phoma, Aureobasidium and Trichoderma species being isolated) in contrast to pristine soils, from which only Verticillium was occasionally isolated.

AB  - Growing interest in understanding the relevance of marine fungi to food webs, biogeochemical cycling, and biological patterns necessitates establishing a context for interpreting future findings. To help establish this context, we summarize the diversity of cultured and observed marine planktonic fungi from across the world. While exploring this diversity, we discovered that only half of the known marine fungal species have a publicly available DNA locus, which we hypothesize will likely hinder accurate highthroughput sequencing classification in the future, as it does currently. Still, we reprocessed >600 high-throughput datasets and analyzed 4.9 x 10(9) sequences (4.8 x 10(9) shotgun metagenomic reads and 1.0 x 10(8) amplicon sequences) and found that every fungal phylum is represented in the global marine planktonic mycobiome; however, this mycobiome is generally predominated by three phyla: the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Chytridiomycota. We hypothesize that these three clades are the most abundant due to a combination of evolutionary histories, as well as physical processes that aid in their dispersal. We found that environments with atypical salinity regimes (>5 standard deviations from the global mean: Red Sea, Baltic Sea, sea ice) hosted higher proportions of the Chytridiomycota, relative to open oceans that are dominated by Dikarya. The Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea had the highest fungal richness of all areas explored. An analysis of similarity identified significant differences between oceanographic regions. There were no latitudinal gradients of marine fungal richness and diversity observed. As more high-throughput sequencing data become available, expanding the collection of reference loci and genomes will be essential to understanding the ecology of marine fungi.

AB  - Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems currently include very few non-native species, due to the continent's extreme isolation from other landmasses. However, the indigenous biota is vulnerable to human-mediated introductions of non-native species. In December 2005, four construction vehicles were imported by contractors to the British Antarctic Survey's (BAS) Rothera Research Station (Antarctic Peninsula) from the Falkland Islands and South Georgia (South Atlantic) on board RRS James Clark Ross. The vehicles were contaminated with > 132 kg of non-Antarctic soil that contained viable non-native angiosperms, bryophytes, micro-invertebrates, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, and c. 40,000 seeds and numerous moss propagules. The incident was a significant contravention of BAS operating procedures, the UK Antarctic Act (1994) and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1998), which all prohibit the introduction of non-native species to Antarctica without an appropriate permit. The introduction of this diverse range of species poses a significant threat to local biodiversity should any of the species become established, particularly as the biota of sub-Antarctic South Georgia is likely to include many species with appropriate pre-adaptations facilitating the colonisation of more extreme Antarctic environments. Once the incident was discovered, the imported soil was removed immediately from Antarctica and destroyed. Vehicle cleaning and transportation guidelines have been revised to enhance the biosecurity of BAS operations, and to minimise the risk of similar incidents occurring.

AB  - Bacterial growth at low pressure is a new research area with implications for predicting microbial activity in clouds and the bulk atmosphere on Earth, and for modeling the forward contamination of planetary surfaces like Mars. Here, we describe experiments on the recovery and identification of 23 species of bacterial hypobarophiles (def., growth under hypobaric conditions of approximately 1-2 kPa) in 11 genera capable of growth at 0.7 kPa. Hypobarophilic bacteria, but not archaea or fungi, were recovered from soil and non-soil ecosystems. The highest numbers of hypobarophiles were recovered from Arctic soil, Siberian permafrost, and human saliva. Isolates were identified through 16S rRNA sequencing to belong to the genera Carnobacterium, Exiguobacterium, Leuconostoc, Paenibacillus, and Trichococcus. The highest population of culturable hypobarophilic bacteria (5.1 x 10(4) cfu/g) was recovered from Colour Lake soils from Axel Heiberg Island in the Canadian Arctic. In addition, we extend the number of hypobarophilic species in the genus Serratia to six type-strains that include S. ficaria, S. fonticola, S. grimesii, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, and S. quinivorans. Microbial growth at 0.7 kPa suggests that pressure alone will not be growth-limiting on the martian surface or in Earth's atmosphere up to an altitude of 34 km.

AB  - Cryptoendolithic Antarctic black fungi are adapted to the harshest terrestrial conditions as in the ice-free area of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Recently, surviving space simulated conditions proves their bewildering extremotolerance. In order to investigate the potential DNA damage and their response after UV-B exposition, two strains of Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungi, Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 534 and Cryomyces minteri CCFEE 5187, were irradiated at different UV-B doses. Since conventional methods cannot be applied to these organisms, the effect on the genome was assessed by RAPD and rDNA amplification PCR based assays; the results were compared with the responses of Saccharomyces pastorianus DBVPG 6283 treated with the same conditions. Results showed that template activity was drastically inhibited in S. pastorianus after irradiation. Dramatic changes in the RAPD profiles showed after 30 min of exposure while the rDNA amplification of SSU, LSU, and ITS portions failed after 30, 60, and 90 min of exposure respectively. No alteration was detected in the templates of the Antarctic strains where both RAPD profiles and rDNA PCR amplifications were unaffected even after 240 min of exposure. The electroferograms of the rDNA portions of Cryomyces strains were perfectly readable and conserved whilst the analyses revealed a marked alteration in S. pastorianus confirming the high resistance of the Antarctic strains to UV-B exposure.

AB  - Fungi associated with photosynthetic organisms are major determinants of terrestrial biomass, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem productivity from the poles to the equator. Whereas most fungi are known because of their fruit bodies (e.g., saprotrophs), symptoms (e.g., pathogens), or emergent properties as symbionts (e.g., lichens), the majority of fungal diversity is thought to occur among species that rarely manifest their presence with visual cues on their substrate (e.g., the apparently hyperdiverse fungal endophytes associated with foliage of plants). Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous among all lineages of land plants and live within overtly healthy tissues without causing disease, but the evolutionary origins of these highly diverse symbionts have not been explored. Here, we show that a key to understanding both the evolution of endophytism and the diversification of the most species-rich phylum of Fungi (Ascomycota) lies in endophyte-like fungi that can be isolated from the interior of apparently healthy lichens. These "endolichenic" fungi are distinct from lichen mycobionts or any other previously recognized fungal associates of lichens, represent the same major lineages of Ascomycota as do endophytes, largely parallel the high diversity of endophytes from the arctic to the tropics, and preferentially associate with green algal photobionts in lichen thalli. Using phylogenetic analyses that incorporate these newly recovered fungi and ancestral state reconstructions that take into account phylogenetic uncertainty, we show that endolichenism is an incubator for the evolution of endophytism. In turn, endophytism is evolutionarily transient, with endophytic lineages frequently transitioning to and from pathogenicity. Although symbiotrophic lineages frequently give rise to free-living saprotrophs, reversions to symbiosis are rare. Together, these results provide the basis for estimating trophic transition networks in the Ascomycota and provide a first set of hypotheses regarding the evolution of symbiotrophy and saprotrophy in the most species-rich fungal phylum.

AB  - Urnula sp. was isolated as an endophyte of Dicksonia antarctica and identified primarily on the basis of its ITS sequence and morphological features. The anamorphic state of the fungus appeared as a hyphomyceteous-like fungus as based on its features in culture and scanning electron microscopy examination of its spores. On potato dextrose agar (PDA), the organism makes a characteristic fragrance resembling peach pie with vanilla overtones. A GC/MS analysis done on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of this organism, trapped by carbotrap methodology, revealed over 150 compounds with high MS matching quality being noted for 44 of these. Some of the most abundantly produced compounds included 4-decene, tridecane, 2-decene (E), 2-dodecene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, butanoic acid, pentyl ester, and 1-hexanol,2-ethyl. In addition, vanillin, methyl vanillin, and many other fragrant substances were noted including isomenthol, pyrazine derivatives, and 3-decanone. In split plate bioassay tests on potato dextrose agar (PDA), Botrytis cinerea, Ceratocystis ulmi, Pythium ultimum, Fusarium solani, and Rhizoctonia solani were inhibited at levels of 24 to 50% of their normal growth on this medium. Bioreactors supporting fungal growth on 50 g of beet pulp waste, using stainless steel carbotraps, yielded over 180 mg of hydrocarbon-based products collected over 6 weeks of incubation. Similarly, because this organism is making one of the largest sets of VOCs as any fungus examined to date, producing many compounds of commercial interest, it has enormous biotechnical potential. The role of the VOCs in the biology and ecology of this endophyte may be related to the antimicrobial activities that they possess.

AB  - IntroductionPhytopathogenic fungi are a considerable concern for agriculture, as they can threaten the productivity of several crops worldwide. Meanwhile, natural microbial products are acknowledged to play an important role in modern agriculture as they comprehend a safer alternative to synthetic pesticides. Bacterial strains from underexplored environments are a promising source of bioactive metabolites. MethodsWe applied the OSMAC (One Strain, Many Compounds) cultivation approach, in vitro bioassays, and metabolo-genomics analyses to investigate the biochemical potential of Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b, a strain isolated from Antarctica. Crude extracts from OSMAC were analyzed through HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, molecular networking, and annotation. The antifungal potential of the extracts was confirmed against Rhizoctonia solani strains. Moreover, the whole-genome sequence was studied for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identification and phylogenetic comparison. Results and DiscussionMolecular networking revealed that metabolite synthesis has growth media specificity, and it was reflected in bioassays results against R. solani. Bananamides, rhamnolipids, and butenolides-like molecules were annotated from the metabolome, and chemical novelty was also suggested by several unidentified compounds. Additionally, genome mining confirmed a wide variety of BGCs present in this strain, with low to no similarity with known molecules. An NRPS-encoding BGC was identified as responsible for producing the banamides-like molecules, while phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship with other rhizosphere bacteria. Therefore, by combining -omics approaches and in vitro bioassays, our study demonstrates that Pseudomonas sp. So3.2b has potential application to agriculture as a source of bioactive metabolites.

AB  - Soil bacteria and fungi play key roles in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, yet our understanding of their responses to climate change lags significantly behind that of other organisms. This gap in our understanding is particularly true for drylands, which occupy similar to 41% of Earth ' s surface, because no global, systematic assessments of the joint diversity of soil bacteria and fungi have been conducted in these environments to date. Here we present results from a study conducted across 80 dryland sites from all continents, except Antarctica, to assess how changes in aridity affect the composition, abundance, and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi. The diversity and abundance of soil bacteria and fungi was reduced as aridity increased. These results were largely driven by the negative impacts of aridity on soil organic carbon content, which positively affected the abundance and diversity of both bacteria and fungi. Aridity promoted shifts in the composition of soil bacteria, with increases in the relative abundance of Chloroflexi and alpha-Proteobacteria and decreases in Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Contrary to what has been reported by previous continental and global-scale studies, soil pH was not a major driver of bacterial diversity, and fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota. Our results fill a critical gap in our understanding of soil microbial communities in terrestrial ecosystems. They suggest that changes in aridity, such as those predicted by climate-change models, may reduce microbial abundance and diversity, a response that will likely impact the provision of key ecosystem services by global drylands.

AB  - Antarctic soils are unique from those found nearly anywhere else on Earth yet can still harbor a broad diversity of microorganisms able to tolerate the challenging conditions typical of the continent. For these reasons, microbiologists have been drawn to Antarctica for decades. However, our understanding of which microbes thrive in Antarctic soils and how they to do so remains limited. To help resolve these knowledge gaps, we analyzed a collection of 200 archived Antarctic soils-from Livingston Island on the Antarctic Peninsula to Cape Hallett in northern Victoria Land. We analyzed the prokaryotic and fungal communities in these soils using both cultivation-independent marker gene sequencing and cultivation-dependent approaches (microbial isolation), paired with extensive soil geochemical analyses. Our cultivation-independent analyses indicate that colder, saltier, and drier soils harbor less diverse communities of bacteria and fungi, distinct from those found in soils with less challenging conditions. We also built a culture collection from a subset of these soils that encompasses more than 50 bacterial and fungal genera, including cold-tolerant organisms, such as Cryobacterium and Cryomyces. By directly comparing the diversity of our cultured isolates against our cultivation-independent data, we show that many of the more abundant Antarctic taxa are not readily cultivated and highlight bacterial and fungal taxa that should be the focus of future cultivation efforts. Together, we hope that our collection of isolates, the comprehensive data compiled from the cultivation-independent analyses, and our geochemical analyses will serve as a community resource to accelerate the study of Antarctic soil microbes.

AB  - We assessed the diversity of cultivable fungi in the ornithogenic soil nests of bird species like Phalacrocorax atriceps, Macronectes giganteus, Pygoscelis antarcticus, and Pygoscelis papua in the Antarctic islands. From 481 fungi isolated at 15 degrees C, only 50 displayed growth at 37 degrees C, and were identified as 14 species of 15 genera. Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were the most abundant species obtained. Fifty taxa grew at 40 degrees C; displayed haemolytic and phospholipase activities; produced tiny spores, capsule, and melanin; showed growth at different pH; and showed resistance to amphotericin B. Interestingly, the minimum inhibitory concentration of amphotericin B increased by 5-10 fold for some A. fumigatus isolates after phagocytosis by amoeba. Our results show relations among fungal community compositions present in Antarctic ornithogenic soil and their pathogenic risk to humans in vitro. As the Antarctica Peninsula is a major region of the planet affected by global climate changes, our results, though preliminary, raise concerns about the dispersal of potential pathogenic microbes present in Antarctic substrates by wild birds, which can fly great distances and spread potential pathogens mainly to South America and Oceania.

AB  - The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica present extreme environmental challenges. Life is restricted to patchy occurrence of lichens, mosses and invertebrates, plus soil microbial communities. Fungi have been described in lichen symbioses but relatively little is known about the occurrence of free-living soil fungi in the Dry Valleys. A challenge in estimating fungal species richness has been the extent to which estimates based on either cultivation or environmental DNA reflect the active assemblage in cold-arid soils. Here, we describe analysis for inland Dry Valleys soil of environmental DNA and RNA (cDNA) to infer total and putative metabolically active assemblages, respectively, plus cultivation approaches using a variety of laboratory growth conditions. Environmental sequences indicated a highly restricted assemblage of just seven phylotypes that affiliated phylogenetically within two known genera, Helicodendron and Zalerion, plus previously unidentified fungal phylotypes. None of the commonly encountered molds and mitosporic genera recorded from maritime Antarctic locations were encountered. A striking difference was observed in the frequency of recovery for phylotypes between libraries. This suggests that both species richness and beta diversity estimates based on DNA libraries have the potential to misinform putatively active assemblages. Cultivation yielded a cold-tolerant Zalerion strain that affiliated with DNA and RNA library clones, and a psychrotrophic yeast (Debaryomyces hansenii), which was not detected using either culture-independent approach.

AB  - The occurrence and distribution of culturable fungi in Taylor Valley, Antarctica was assessed in terms of soil habitat. Soil transects throughout the valley revealed differential habitat utilization between filamentous and non-filamentous (yeast and yeast-like) fungi. In addition, there were significant differences in species distribution patterns with respect to soil pH, moisture, distance from marine coastline, carbon, chlorophyll a, salinity, elevation and solar inputs. Filamentous fungal abundance is most closely associated with habitats having higher pH, and soil moistures. These close associations were not found with yeast and yeast-like fungi demonstrating that yeast and yeast-like fungi utilize a broader range of habitat. An intensive survey of the Victoria Land is necessary to gain a better understanding of their role in soil functioning and nutrient cycling processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Polar and alpine ecosystems appear to be particularly sensitive to increasing temperatures and the altered precipitation patterns linked to climate change. However, little is currently known about how these environmental drivers may affect edaphic organisms within these ecosystems. In this study, we examined communities of plant root-associated fungi (RAF) over large biogeographical scales and along climatic gradients in the North Atlantic region in order to gain insights into the potential effects of climate variability on these communities. We also investigated whether selected fungal traits were associated with particular climates. Locations Austria, Scotland, Mainland Norway, Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Taxa Root fungi associated with the ectomycorrhizal and herbaceous plant Bistorta vivipara. Methods DNA metabarcoding of the ITS1 region was used to characterize the RAF of 302 whole plant root systems, which were analysed by means of ordination methods and linear modelling. Fungal spore length, width, volume and shape, as well as mycelial exploration type (ET) of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes were summarized at a community level. Results The RAF communities exhibited strong biogeographical structuring, and both compositional variation as well as fungal species richness correlated with annual temperature and precipitation. In accordance with general island biogeography theory, the least species-rich RAF communities were found on Jan Mayen, a remote and small island in the North Atlantic Ocean. Fungal spores tended to be more elongated with increasing latitude. We also observed a climate effect on which mycelial ET was dominating among the ectomycorrhizal fungi. Main conclusions Both geographical and environmental variables were important for shaping root-associated fungal communities at a North Atlantic scale, including the High Arctic. Fungal OTU richness followed general biogeographical patterns and decreased with decreasing size and/or increasing isolation of the host plant population. The probability of possessing more elongated spores increases with latitude, which may be explained by a selection for greater dispersal capacity among more isolated host plant populations in the Arctic.

AB  - The historic expedition huts located in the Ross Sea Region of the Antarctic and the thousands of artifacts left behind by the early explorers represent important cultural heritage from the "Heroic Era" of Polar exploration. The hut at Cape Royds built by Ernest Shackleton and members of the 1907-1908 British Antarctic Expedition has survived the extreme Antarctic environment for over 100 years, but recent studies have shown many forms of deterioration are causing serious problems, and microbial degradation is evident in the historic wood. Conservation work to reduce moisture at the hut required removal of fodder, wood, and many different types of organic materials from the stables area on the north side of the structure allowing large numbers of samples to be obtained for these investigations. In addition, wood from historic food storage boxes exposed in a ravine adjacent to the hut were also sampled. Fungi were cultured on several different media, and pure cultures were obtained and identified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA. From the 69 cultures of filamentous fungi obtained, the most predominant genera were Cadophora (44%) followed by Thielavia (17%) and Geomyces (15%). Other fungi found included Cladosporium, Chaetomium, and isolates identified as being in Pezizomycotina, Onygenales, Nectriaceae, and others. No filamentous basidiomycetes were found. Phylogenetic analyses of the Cadophora species showed great species diversity present revealing Cadophora malorum, Cadophora luteo-olivacea, Cadophora fastigiata, as well as Cadophora sp. 4E71-1, a C. malorum-like species, and Cadophora sp. 7R16-1, a C. fastigiata-like species. Scanning electron microscopy showed extensive decay was present in the wood samples with type 1 and type 2 forms of soft rot evident in pine and birch wood, respectively. Fungi causing decay in the historic wooden structures and artifacts are of great concern, and this investigation provides insight into the identity and species diversity of fungi found at the site. The historic woods and other organic materials at this site represent a large input of carbon into the Antarctic environment. This as well as nutrient additions from the nearby Ad,lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony and favorable conditions for fungal growth at Cape Royds appear responsible for the significant fungal diversity, and where extensive decay is taking place in wood in contact with the ground.

AB  - Microbes growing at low temperatures encounter numerous growth constraints. However, fungi that inhabit polar regions can grow and decompose organic compounds at low temperatures. Research on the biodiversity and secretion ability of yeasts from East Ongul Island, and evaluation of their extracellular enzymatic activity at temperatures ranging from -3 to 20 A degrees C, was performed and described in this study. In total, 95 yeast strains were isolated from the surface soil on East Ongul Island, East Antarctica. Based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain sequence similarity, these strains were classified into 10 genera and 16 species. All strains were categorized as basidiomycetous yeasts. One representative strain was selected from each species, and its ability to grow at temperatures between -3 and 37 A degrees C was evaluated. Strain abilities to secrete extracellular enzymes (lipase, cellulase, and protease) at temperatures ranging from -3 to 20 A degrees C were also investigated. Based on the optimal and maximal growth temperatures, the yeasts were classified as psychrophilic or psychrotolerant. All the strains investigated in this study were able to grow at -3 A degrees C and in vitamin-free media. Psychrophilic yeasts, such as Glaciozyma antarctica, Gl. martinii, Mrakia gelida, and Phenoliferia glacialis, did not secrete pronounced amounts of extracellular enzymes at -3 A degrees C; in contrast, the psychrotolerant yeasts Goffeauzyma gilvescens, Holtermanniella wattica, Tausonia pullulans, and Udeniomyces puniceus secreted copious amounts of enzymes, even at subzero temperatures. These results indicated that psychrotolerant yeasts, rather than psychrophilic yeasts, play important roles in the nutrient cycle in the East Ongul Island ecosystem at near-subzero temperatures.

AB  - Here we present the first culture-independent microbiological and biogeochemical study of the mineral soils from 6000 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.) on some the highest volcanoes in the Atacama region of Argentina and Chile. These soils experience some of the harshest environmental conditions on Earth including daily temperature fluctuations across the freezing point (with an amplitude of up to 70 degrees C) and intense solar radiation. Soil carbon and water levels are among the lowest yet measured for a terrestrial ecosystem and enzyme activity was near or below detection limits for all microbial enzymes measured. The soil microbial communities were among the simplest yet studied in a terrestrial environment and contained novel Bacteria and Fungi and only one Archaeal phylotype. No photosynthetic organisms were detected but several of the dominant bacterial phylotypes are related to organisms involved in carbon monoxide oxidation on other volcanoes (e.g., Pseudonocardia and Ktedonobacter spp.). Focused studies of a gene responsible for carbon monoxide oxidation, the large subunit of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (coxL of CODH), revealed several novel lineages and a broad diversity of coxL genes. Overall our results suggest that a unique microbial community, sustained by diffuse atmospheric and volcanic gases, is barely functioning on these volcanoes, which represent the highest terrestrial ecosystems yet studied.

AB  - We surveyed the diversity of cultivable fungi isolated from cold and hot volcanic soils of Deception Island, Antarctica. Seventy-four fungal isolates were identified; these belonged to 17 taxa in the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, Purpureocillium, and Mortierella. The fungal assemblages showed low diversity, richness, and dominance indices. The Aspergillus taxa were dominant in the soils at 0 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 100 degrees C. Aspergillus lacticoffeatus, Aspergillus cf. ruber, Penicillium citrinun, and Purpureocillium sodanum were present only in soils having a temperature of 100 degrees C. Aspergillus calidoustus was present in all thermal soils and displayed the highest densities. The majority of fungi displayed mesophilic behavior; however, different isolates of Aspergillus lacticoffeatus and Aspergillus niger were able to grow at 50 degrees C; these are phylogenetically close to the causative agents of aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals. Deception Island perhaps represents one of the most visited regions in Antarctica and the tourism there has increased over the last 20 years, especially by elderly tourists, probably with weak immune systems, come in contact with the resident microorganisms, including the thermo-resistant opportunistic Aspergillus species.

AB  - Environmental disturbance is an unpreventable consequence of human impact after exploration and research station management in Antarctica. Environmental pollution may directly influence Antarctic mycobiota. However, information about the effect of anthropogenic factors on microscopic fungi at extremely low temperatures is insufficient. This work compared the abundance and the species diversity of mycelial fungi from soils of six Russian research Antarctic stationsBellingshausen, Progress-2, Druzhnaya-4, Molodezhnaya, Novolazarevskaya and Oasis-affected by various anthropogenic impacts (operation of tracked and wheeled vehicles, storage and use of petroleum products and petroleum leakage sites) with that from their background analogues. New data were obtained on the taxonomic diversity of mycelial fungi from Antarctic soils with different anthropogenic loads. Cultural, morphological and physiological studies of 142 isolated strains of mycelial fungi were supplemented by molecular-biological research into sterile mycelium strains and those with vague morphological characters. This contributed not only to the verification but also to a significant increase in the number of taxa of mycelial fungi isolated from low-temperature ecotopes. Leotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes were found to be the most dominant classes in the studied samples. It was shown that several ecological groups of micromycetes could be isolated among the mycobiota of the investigated habitats, the abundance and species composition of which changed differently under the influence of anthropogenic factors. The current results highlight that microbiota changes in human-affected soils can serve as an indicator of the state of low-temperature ecotopes in general.

AB  - Plant pathogens cause great economic losses in agriculture. To reduce damage, chemical pesticides have been frequently used, but these compounds in addition to causing risks to the environment and health, its continuous use has given rise to resistant phytopathogens, threatening the efficiency of control methods. One alternative for such a problem is the use of natural products with high antifungal activity and low toxicity. Here, we present the production, isolation, and identification of cyclopaldic acid, a bioactive compound produced by Penicillium sp. CRM 1540, a fungal strain isolated from Antarctic marine sediment. The crude extract was fractionated by reversed-phase chromatography and yielded 40 fractions, from which fraction F17 was selected. We used 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis in DMSO-d6 and CDCl3, together with mass spectrometry, to identify the compound as cyclopaldic acid C11H10O6 (238 Da). The pure compound was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against phytopathogenic fungi of global agricultural importance, namely: Macrophomina phaseolina, Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The antifungal assay revealed the potential of cyclopaldic acid, produced by Penicillium sp. CRM 1540, as a leading molecule against M. phaseolina and R. solani, with more than 90% of growth inhibition after 96h of contact with the fungal cells using 100 mu g mL(-1), and more than 70% using 50 mu g mL(-1).

AB  - The analysis of algal-mycological complexes in Albic Podzolic soils affected by emissions of the Kandalaksha Aluminum Smelter (KAS) was carried out. The number and biomass of microscopic fungi in the maximum fluorine-polluted zone (fluorine-content >1000 mg/kg) more than 2 times lower than in distanced areas and amounted to 17.3 thousants colony- forming units/ g and 1.33 mg/g respectively. Altogether, 31 species of soil fungi were isolated. The species Penicillium trzebinskii and P. miczynskii dominated the zone of maximum pollution. P. glabrum, P. spinulosum, and Memnoniella echinata prevailed in the zones of moderate pollution and background. The part of opportunistic fungi in contaminated soil increased in comparison with the background soil. The reduction of dark-colored fungi biomass in contaminated soil was noted. In total, 56 species of eukaryotic algae and 7 species of cyanobacteria were found. Among green algae, the species from families Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae dominated in all plots. In the zones of maximum and strong contamination, 53 algae species were found including xanthophytes, which were absent in unpolluted areas. The number of viable cells in the litter of the maximum contaminated soils varied from 100 thousand to 1.5 million in 1 g of absolutely dry soil. The species composition of algae and cyanobacteria in these soils showed the characteristic features of the Arctic biological soil crusts.

AB  - Humic substances (HS), primarily humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), are the largest constituent of soil organic matter. In microcosm systems with subarctic HS-rich tundra soil (site AK 1-75; approximately 5.6 A degrees C during the thawing period) from Council, Alaska, the HA content significantly decreased to 48 % after a 99-day incubation at 5 A degrees C as part of a biologically mediated process. Accordingly, levels of FA, a putative byproduct of HA degradation, consistently increased to 172 % during an identical incubation process. Culture-independent microbial community analysis showed that during the microcosm experiments, the relative abundance of phyla Proteobacteria (bacteria) and Euryarchaeota (archaea) largely increased, indicating their involvement in HS degradation. When the indigenous bacteria in AK 1-75 were enriched in an artificial mineral medium spiked with HA, the changes in relative abundance were most conspicuous in Proteobacteria (from 60.2 to 79.0 %), specifically Betaproteobacteria-related bacteria. One hundred twenty-two HA-degrading bacterial strains, primarily from the genera Paenibacillus (phylum Firmicutes) and Pseudomonas (class Gammaproteobacteria), were cultivated from AK 1-75 and nearby sites. Through culture-dependent analysis with these bacterial isolates, we observed increasing HS-degradation rates in parallel with rising temperatures in a range of 0 A degrees C to 20 A degrees C, with the most notable increase occurring at 8 A degrees C compared to 6 A degrees C. Our results indicate that, although microbial-mediated HS degradation occurs at temperature as low as 5 A degrees C in tundra ecosystems, increasing soil temperature caused by global climate change could enhance HS degradation rates. Extending the thawing period could also increase degradation activity, thereby directly affecting nearby microbial communities and rhizosphere environments.

AB  - Here we investigate the microbiomes of the soil samples from the Yamal Peninsula (the surroundings of Salekhard city, Russian Federation) using a high-throughput sequencing approach. The main goal was to investigate the impact of mining on soils within the following regeneration, both during the reclamation practice and natural self-growth. Several quarries were studied, engaged in sand, clay and chromatic ores mining. The taxonomic analysis of the soil microbiomes revealed 50 bacterial and archaeal phyla; among the dominant phyla were: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chroloflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, AD3, and Nitrospirae. Compared to the typical tundra soil, which was chosen as a control, the disturbed soils had increased biodiversity and total counts for soil bacteria, archaea, and fungi, especially in the cryosolic horizon. The different mining strategies caused significantly different transformations of soil microbiomes, which was less pronounced for self-growth compared to reclaimed quarries. This isolation of the reclaimed quarry was mainly associated with the increase of the amount of acidobacteria (fam. Koribacteraceae and Acidobacteriaceae and order Ellin6513), some proteohacterial taxa (lam. Syntrophobacteraceae), and Chlorollexi (fam. Thennogeintnatisporaceae). The study also revealed bacteria, which tend to be specific for marine tundra environments: gemmatinionadetes from the order N1473WL and Chlorotlexi bacteria from the order Gitt-GS-136.

AB  - Antarctic soil represents an important reservoir of filamentous fungi (FF) species with the ability to produce novel bioactive lipids. However, the lipid extraction method is still a bottleneck. The objective of the present work was to isolate and identify cultivable FF from Antarctic soils, to assess the most effective methods for fatty acid (FA) extraction, and to characterise the obtained lipids. A total of 18 fungal strains belonging to the Botrytis, Cladosporium, Cylindrobasidium, Mortierella, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, and Talaromyces genera and the Melanommataceae family were isolated and identified. The Folch, Bligh and Dyer, and Lewis extraction methods were assessed, and methyl esters of FA (FAMEs) were obtained. The Lewis method was the best in recovering FAMEs from fungal biomass. A total of 17 FAs were identified, and their chemical compositions varied depending on fungal species and strain. Oleic, linoleic, stearic, and palmitic acids were predominant for all fungal strains in the three assessed methods. Among the analysed strains, Cylindrobasidium eucalypti, Penicillium miczynskii, P. virgatum, and Pseudogymnoascus pannorum produced high amounts of FA. This suggests that the soils of Antarctica Bay, as well as harbouring known oleaginous fungi, are also an important source of oleaginous filamentous fungi that remain poorly analysed.

AB  - Filamentous fungi in 36 samples of Antarctic permafrost sediments were studied. The samples collected during the Russian Antarctic expedition of 20072009 within the framework of the Antarctic Permafrost Age Project (ANTPAGE) were recovered from different depths in ice-free oases located along the perimeter of the continent. Fungal diversity was determined by conventional microbiological techniques combined with a culture-independent method based on the analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) sequences in total DNA of the samples. The study revealed a rather low fungal population density in permafrost, although the diversity found was appreciable, representing more than 26 genera. Comparison of the data obtained by different techniques showed that the culture-independent method enabled the detection of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous fungi not found by culturing. The molecular method failed to detect members of the genera Penicillium and Cladosporium that possess small-sized spores known to have a high resistance to environmental changes.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were extracted from samples of eight different sites of sandy soils in Iceland. Eleven species of AMF were identified directly from original soil samples or trap culture using the host plant Allium porrum. Six AMF species were successfully subcultured in pots with the host plant Plantago lanceolata. Species from four genera of the order Glomerales (Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Glomus, and Scutellospora) were identified. The AMF species identified from subcultured pots included Glomus hoi, G. clarum, and a species of Scutellospora resembling S. dipurpurascens. Three other, as yet unidentified, species of Glomus were also isolated. AMF root colonization was estimated on Leymus arenarius (lymegrass), the main dune-building grass in Iceland during the growing season. Total AMF root colonization did not depend upon the season. However, percentage root colonization of arbuscules was significantly highest in July, indicating the highest peak of functional AMF activity. This survey of AMF is the first conducted in Iceland. The importance of this work is discussed in relation to occurrence of AMF species in polar regions and in relation to sand dune reclamation.

AB  - Antarctic environments can sustain a great diversity of well-adapted microorganisms known as psychrophiles or psychrotrophs. The potential of these microorganisms as a resource of enzymes able to maintain their activity and stability at low temperature for technological applications has stimulated interest in exploration and isolation of microbes from this extreme environment. Enzymes produced by these organisms have a considerable potential for technological applications because they are known to have higher enzymatic activities at lower temperatures than their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts. A total of 518 Antarctic microorganisms, were isolated during Antarctic expeditions organized by the Instituto Antartico Uruguayo. Samples of particules suspended in air, ice, sea and freshwater, soil, sediment, bird and marine animal faeces, dead animals, algae, plants, rocks and microbial mats were collected from different sites in maritime Antarctica. We report enzymatic activities present in 161 microorganisms (120 bacteria, 31 yeasts and 10 filamentous fungi) isolated from these locations. Enzymatic performance was evaluated at 4 and 20A degrees C. Most of yeasts and bacteria grew better at 20A degrees C than at 4A degrees C, however the opposite was observed with the fungi. Amylase, lipase and protease activities were frequently found in bacterial strains. Yeasts and fungal isolates typically exhibited lipase, celullase and gelatinase activities. Bacterial isolates with highest enzymatic activities were identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as Pseudomonas spp., Psychrobacter sp., Arthrobacter spp., Bacillus sp. and Carnobacterium sp. Yeasts and fungal strains, with multiple enzymatic activities, belonged to Cryptococcus victoriae, Trichosporon pullulans and Geomyces pannorum.

AB  - Premise of research. Despite the ecological significance of arbuscular mycorrhizae in modern terrestrial ecosystems, knowledge about their evolution based on the fossil record is still scarce, especially concerning the case of root nodules harboring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, as in some extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. Exceptionally preserved conifer nodular roots were found in the Jurassic fossil-bearing chert deposits of the Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz, Argentina), raising the possibility of studying them in association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The aim of this study is to describe the plant organs and their fungal partners and to discuss the ecological significance of the interactions observed, particularly with respect to their occurrence in the hot spring settings. Methodology. Thin sections of chert samples from the Canadon Nahuel locality of the La Matilde Formation, Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz, Argentina) were observed using light microscopy. Pivotal results. The cortex of the nodules is occupied by several glomeromycotan fungal structures. The structures occur in a specific zone of the cortex-toward its center-and include intracellular hyphal coils and arbuscules. Glomoid spores and coenocytic hyphae possibly penetrating the epidermal cells are also described and analyzed. Conclusions. The root nodules have affinities with the Araucariales, representing the oldest record of such structures for this conifer clade. This is also the first record of nodules harboring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for the Jurassic; it extends our knowledge of the fossil record for this particular type of fungal association.

AB  - The presence of fungi in pristine Antarctic soils is of particular interest because of the diversity of this microbial group. However, the extreme conditions that coexist in Antarctica produce a strong selective pressure that could lead to the evolution of novel mechanisms for stress tolerance by indigenous microorganisms. For this reason, in recent years, research on cold-adapted microorganisms has increased, driven by their potential value for applications in biotechnology. Cold-adapted fungi, in particular, have become important sources for the discovery of novel bioactive secondary metabolites and enzymes. In this study, we studied the fungal community structure of 12 soil samples from Antarctic sites, including King George Island (including Collins Glacier), Deception Island and Robert Island. Culturable fungi were isolated and described according to their morphological and phenotypical characteristics, and the richness index was compared with soil chemical properties to describe the fungal community and associated environmental parameters. We isolated 54 fungal strains belonging to the following 19 genera: Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, Lambertella, Cadophora, Candida, Mortierella, Oxygenales, Geomyces, Vishniacozyma, Talaromyces, Rhizopus, Antarctomyces, Cosmospora, Tetracladium, Leptosphaeria, Lecanicillium, Thelebolus, Bjerkandera and an uncultured Zygomycete. The isolated fungi were comprised of 70% Ascomycota, 10% Zygomycota, 10% Basidiomycota, 5% Deuteromycota and 5% Mucoromycota, highlighting that most strains were associated with similar genera grown in cold environments. Among the culturable strains, 55% were psychrotrophic and 45% were psychrophilic, and most were Ascomycetes occurring in their teleomorph forms. Soils from the Collins Glacier showed less species richness and greater species dominance compared with the rest of the sites, whereas samples 4, 7, and 10 (from Fildes Bay, Coppermine Peninsula and Arctowski Station, respectively) showed greater species richness and less species dominance. Species richness was related to the C/N ratio, whereas species dominance was inversely related to C and N content. Thus, the structure of the fungal community was mainly related to soil chemical parameters more than sample location and altitude.

AB  - Microorganisms play a dominant role in Antarctic ecosystems, yet little is known about how fungal diversity differs at sites with considerable human activity as compared to those that are remote and relatively pristine. Ross Island, Antarctica is the site of three historic expedition huts left by early explorers to the South Pole, Robert F. Scott and. Ernest Shackleton. The fungal diversity of these wooden structures and surrounding soils was investigated with traditional culturing methods as well as with molecular methodology including denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA for identification. From historic wood and artifact samples and soils adjacent to the huts as well as soil samples obtained from the Lake Fryxell Basin, a remote Dry Valley location, and remote sites at Mt. Fleming and the Allan Hills, 71 fungal taxa were identified. The historic huts and associated artifacts have been colonized and degraded by fungi to various extents. The most frequently isolated fungal genera from the historic woods sampled include Cadophora, Cladosporium and Geomyces. Similar genera were found in soil samples collected near the huts. Sampling of soils from locations in the Transantarctic Mountains and Lake Fryxell Basin at considerable distances from the huts and with different soil conditions revealed Cryptococcus spp., Epicoccum nigrum and Cladosporium cladosporioides as the most common fungi present and Cadophora species less commonly isolated. DGGE revealed 28 taxa, not detected by culturing including four taxa which possibly have not been previously described since they have less than 50% ITS sequence identity to any GenBank accessions. Fungi capable of causing degradation in the wood and artifacts associated with the expedition huts appear to be similar to those present in Antarctic soils, both near and at more remote locations. These species of fungi are likely indigenous to Antarctica and were apparently greatly influenced by the introduction of organic matter brought by early explorers. Considerable degradation has occurred in the wood and other materials by these fungi. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diversity and phylogenetic relationships of fungi obtained from Antarctic soils were analysed using molecular techniques. Direct extraction of soil community DNA from two locations, Fossil Bluff (FB) and Jane Col (JC), was supplemented with isolation studies. Nucleic acids from both the community DNA and the colony extracts were PCR amplified using primers specific for the 18S rRNA gene (18S rDNA). Amplicons were separated in denaturant gels (DGGE) or following endonuclease digestion (ARDRA). Clones presenting unique ARDRA banding patterns and unique DGGE bands were sequenced. Comparison of the experimental sequences from the different techniques employed with those held online resulted in the repeated recovery of a limited range of related organisms indicating low species diversity of microfungi in these soils. A total of 102 fungal sequences were obtained from FB (37 sequences) and JC (65 sequences) that together were distributed among the Basidiomycota (48 sequences), Ascomycota (48 sequences) and Zygomycota (6 sequences). Sequences of the latter were only recovered from the JC soils. Phylogenetic comparisons of the experimental sequences with those held online have shown high rRNA gene relatedness with those obtained from other, less extreme, environments.

AB  - While a vast number of studies have addressed the prokaryotic diversity in permafrost, characterized by subzero temperatures, low water activity, and extremely low rates of nutrient and metabolite transfer, fungal patterns have received surprisingly limited attention. Here, the fungal diversity and community structure were investigated by culture-dependent technique combined with cloning-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of sediments in a 10-m-long permafrost core from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. A total of 62 fungal phylotypes related to 10 distinct classes representing three phyla were recovered from 5031 clones generated in 13 environmental gene libraries. A large proportion of the phylotypes (25/62) that were distantly related to described fungal species appeared to be novel diversity. Ascomycota was the predominant group of fungi, with respect to both clone and phylotype number. Our results suggested there was the existence of cosmopolitan psychrophilic or psychrotolerant fungi in permafrost sediments, the community composition of fungi varied with increasing depth, while these communities largely distributed according to core layers.

AB  - The basidiomycetous yeast Moesziomyces antarcticus (often cited as Pseudozyma antarctica), originally isolated from a sediment sample obtained from Lake Vanda in Antarctica, was asexually typified but closely related to the smut fungus Moesziomyces bullatus (Ustilaginales). We found a smut fungus on an ovary of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) in Japan, which had been identified as M. bullatus. The teliospores germinated and formed yeast-like colonies. Physiological and phylogenetic studies revealed that the characteristics of the yeast-like isolates coincided with those of P. antarctica. We thus recognised the smut fungus as the teleomorph of M. antarcticus, and then emended the description of M. antarcticus based on the holomorph. The identified fungus could degrade certain biodegradable plastics and produce mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) in similar qualities as the P. antarctica type strain. This discovery provides a significant bioresource, as genetically diverse M. antarcticus isolates could be obtained from the smut fungus.

AB  - Fungal endophyte associations have been suggested as a possible strategy of Antarctic vascular plants for surviving the extreme environmental conditions of Antarctica. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are still poorly understood. The role of root fungal endophytes in nitrogen mineralization and nutrient uptake, as well as their impact on the performance of Antarctic plants, were studied. We tested root endophytes, isolated fromColobanthus quitensisandDeschampsia antarctica, for lignocellulolytic enzyme production, nitrogen mineralization, and growth enhancement of their host plants.Penicillium chrysogenumandPenicillium brevicompactumwere identified using a molecular approach as the main root endophytes inhabitingC. quitensisandD. antarctica, respectively. Both root endophytes were characterized as psychrophilic fungi displaying amylase, esterase, protease, cellulase, hemicellulase, phosphatase and urease enzymatic activities, mainly at 4 degrees C. Moreover, the rates and percentages of nitrogen mineralization, as well as the final total biomass, were significantly higher in symbioticC. quitensisandD. antarcticaindividuals. Our findings suggest that root endophytes exert a pivotal ecological role based not only to breakdown different nutrient sources but also on accelerating nitrogen mineralization, improving nutrient acquisition, and therefore promoting plant growth in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Space represents an extremely harmful environment for life and survival of terrestrial organisms. In the last decades, a considerable deal of attention was paid to characterize the effects of spaceflight relevant radiation on various model organisms. The aim of this study was to test the survival capacity of the cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 to space relevant radiation, to outline its endurance to space conditions. In the frame of an international radiation campaign, dried fungal colonies were irradiated with accelerated Helium ion (150 MeV/n, LET 2.2 keV/mu m), up to a final dose of 1,000 Gy, as one of the space-relevant ionizing radiation. Results showed that the fungus maintained high survival and metabolic activity with no detectable DNA and ultrastructural damage, even after the highest dose irradiation. These data give clues on the resistance of life toward space ionizing radiation in general and on the resistance and responses of eukaryotic cells in particular.

AB  - Glacial retreat is one of the most conspicuous signs of warming in Antarctic regions. Glacier soils harbor an active microbial community of decomposers, and under the continuous retraction of glaciers, the soil starts to present a gradient of physical, chemical, and biological factors reflecting regional changes over time. Little is known about the biological nature of fungi in Antarctic glacier soils. In this sense, this work aimed at studying the behavior of fungal community structure from samples of glacier soil collected after glacial retreat (Collins Glacier). A total of 309 fungi distributed in 19 genera were obtained from eleven soil samples. Representatives of the generaPseudogymnoascus(Ascomycota) andMortierella(Mortierellomycota) were the most abundant isolates in all samples. The data revealed the presence of filamentous fungi belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota, rarely found in Antarctica. Analysis of the generalized linear models revealed that the distance from the glacier as well as phosphorus and clay were able to modify the distribution of fungal species. Environmental variations proved to have influenced the generaPseudogymnoascusandPseudeutorium.

AB  - The effects of growth temperature on soluble carbohydrate and lipid content of Humicola marvinii, Geomyces pannororum and Mortierella Humicola isolated fr om the Antarctic (Signy Island; 60 degrees 43'S, 45 degrees 38'W) were investigated. Each of these fungi responded differently to suboptimal growth temperatures. At low temperatures Humicola marvinii accumulated cryoprotective carbohydrates (trehalose intracellularly and glycerol extracellularly), whereas Geomyces pannorum responded by altering its lipid composition with increases in unsaturated lipid content and overall unsaturation index. In the case of Mortierella elongata, features that may influence its ability to grow at low temperatures included the absence of detectable ergosterol, the presence of stearidonic acid and increased amounts of intracellular trehalose when grown at lower temperatures. The relative importance of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in adaptation to temperature stress in these fungi is discussed.

AB  - Fungi play key roles in carbon (C) dynamics of ecosystems: saprotrophs decompose organic material and return C in the nutrient cycle, and mycorrhizal species support plants that accumulate C through photosynthesis. The identities and functions of extremophile fungi present after fire can influence C dynamics, particularly because plant-fungal relationships are often species-specific. However, little is known about the function and distribution of fungi that survive fires. We aim to assess the distribution of heat-resistant soil fungi across burned stands of boreal forest in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and understand their functions in relation to decomposition and tree seedling growth. We cultured and identified fungi from heat-treated soils and linked sequences from known taxa with high throughput sequencing fungal data (Illumina MiSeq, ITS1) from soils collected in 47 plots. We assessed functions under controlled conditions by inoculating litter and seedlings with heat-resistant fungi to assess decomposition and effects on seedling growth, respectively, for black spruce (Picea mariana), birch (Betula papyrifera), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana). We also measured litter decomposition rates and seedling densities in the field without inoculation. We isolated seven taxa of heat-resistant fungi and found their relative abundances were not associated with environmental or fire characteristics. Under controlled conditions,Fayodia gracilipesandPenicillium arenicoladecomposed birch, but no taxa decomposed black spruce litter significantly more than the control treatment. Seedlings showed reduced biomass and/or mortality when inoculated with at least one of the fungal taxa.Penicillium turbatumreduced growth and/or caused mortality of all three species of seedlings. In the field, birch litter decomposed faster in stands with greater pre-fire proportion of black spruce, while black spruce litter decomposed faster in stands experiencing longer fire-free intervals. Densities of seedlings that had germinated since fire were positively associated with ectomycorrhizal richness while there were fewer conifer seedlings with greater heat-resistant fungal abundance. Overall, our study suggests that extremophile fungi present after fires have multiple functions and may have unexpected negative effects on forest functioning and regeneration. In particular, heat-resistant fungi after fires may promote shifts away from conifer dominance that are observed in these boreal forests.

AB  - We documented relative growth rates (RGRs) and activities of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes (EHEs) of one marine-derived tropical strain of Fusarium equiseti originally isolated from Malaysia and two polar strains of Pseudogymnoascus spp. from the Arctic and Antarctic under various temperatures and different nutrient conditions. RGRs and relative enzyme activities (RAs) of protease, amylase and cellulase were screened in seawater nutrient assay plates augmented with either skim milk, soluble starch or carboxymethylcellulose with trypan blue, respectively, across culture temperatures between 5 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Measures of RGR were fitted into third-degree polynomial and Briere-2 temperature-dependent models to estimate optimum temperatures for growth (T-opt) and maximum growth rates (RGR(max)), and were used to calculate temperature coefficients (Q(10)) and activation energies (E-a) for growth. All studied strains showed highest RGR and RA when grown using a skim milk nutrient assay. T-opt for growth was 25 degrees C in F. equiseti and 20 degrees C in Pseudogymnoascus spp. Only F. equiseti showed cellulase activity. These data suggest a preference for protein-based substrates over plant-derived substrates for metabolism in these fungal strains. The tropical F. equiseti could utilise higher levels of thermal energy for growth than the polar strains of Pseudogymnoascus spp., implying adaptation of these fungi to different bioclimatic regions.

AB  - To move beyond targeted approaches to the biochemical characterization of psychrophilic yeast and provide a more holistic understanding of the chemistry of physiological adaptation of psychrophiles at the molecular level, ultraperformance liquid chromatography combined with simultaneous acquisition of low- and high-collision energy mass spectra (UPLC/MSe) was employed for a preliminary comparative analysis of cell extracts of psychrophilic Antarctic yeasts Cryptococcus vishniacii CBS 10616 and Dioszegia cryoxerica CBS 10919 versus the mesophile Saccharomyces cerevisiae 'cry havoc'. A detailed workflow for providing high-confidence preliminary identifications of psychrophilic yeast-specific molecular features is presented. Preliminary identifications of psychrophile-specific features in C. vishniacii and D. cryoxerica determined with the described method include the glycerophospholipids lysophosphatidylcholine 18:2, lysophosphatidylcholine 18:3, lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:3, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:2. In addition, levels of guanosine diphosphate appear significantly elevated in cell extracts of the psychrophilic yeasts as compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Finally, five psychrophilic yeast-specific peptides have been discovered. All of these are demonstrated to be glycine- and/or proline-rich, a known structural characteristic of many naturally occurring bioactive peptides. The potential of this untargeted metabolite profiling approach as a tool for knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation in the study of biodiversity and microbial adaptation is highlighted.

AB  - Thirty-three fungal strains, isolated from different sites on Victoria Land (continental Antarctica), were plate-screened for their ability to produce twelve extracellular enzymes. Lipases were generally present and in high quantities in almost all the strains. Polygalacturonase, as well as amylase and phosphatase, was common. Glucose oxidase, protease and DNAase appeared to be generally low or absent. Many strains, producing a limited number of enzymes, appeared to have a low eco-nutritional versatility while a few, such as Verticillium cfr. lecanii no. 1, V. cfr. lecanii no. 3, Aspergillus versicolor and Phoma sp. no. 2, showing a diversified enzymatic competence, are probably advantaged in extreme terrestrial environments characterized by low competition. The possibility of utilizing the enzyme-producing ability of these fungi in applied research is also discussed.

AB  - Microorganisms were isolated from lignite freshly excavated in the Zahorie coal mine (southwestern Slovakia) under conditions excluding contamination with either soil or air-borne microorganisms. The isolates represented both Prokarya and Eukarya (fungi). All were able to grow on standard media, although some microorganisms were unstable and became extinct during storage of coal samples. Bacteria belonged to the genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Rhodococcus, according to both morphological criteria and ITS sequences. Several bacterial isolates were resistant to antibiotics. The presence of anaerobic bacteria was also documented, although they have not yet been identified. Fungal isolates were typified by using their ITS sequences. They belonged to the genera Trichoderma (Hypocrea), Penicillium, Epicoccum, Metarhizium (Cordyceps), and Cladosporium. Several fungi produced compounds with antibiotic action against standard bacterial strains. The evidence for the presence of microorganisms in native lignite was obtained by means of fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electron microprobe analysis. Results demonstrated that microorganisms were able to survive in the low-rank coal over a long time period. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Endophytic fungi associated with three bryophyte species in the Fildes Region, King George Island, maritime Antarctica, that is, the liverwort Barbilophozia hatcheri, the mosses Chorisodontium aciphyllum and Sanionia uncinata, were studied by culture-dependent method. A total of 128 endophytic fungi were isolated from 1329 tissue segments of 14 samples. The colonization rate of endophytic fungi in three bryophytes species were 12.3%, 12.1%, and 8.7%, respectively. These isolates were identified to 21 taxa, with 15 Ascomycota, 5 Basidiomycota, and 1 unidentified fungus, based on morphological characteristics and sequence analyses of ITS region and D1/D2 domain. The dominant fungal endophyte was Hyaloscyphaceae sp. in B.hatcheri, Rhizoscyphus sp. in C.aciphyllum, and one unidentified fungus in S.uncinata; and their relative frequencies were 33.3%, 32.1%, and 80.0%, respectively. Furthermore, different ShannonWeiner diversity indices (0.911.99) for endophytic fungi and low endophytic fungal composition similarities (0.190.40) were found in three bryophyte species. Growth temperature tests indicated that 21 taxa belong to psychrophiles (9), psychrotrophs (11), and mesophile (1). The results herein demonstrate that the Antarctic bryophytes are an interesting source of fungal endophytes and the endophytic fungal composition is different among the bryophyte species, and suggest that these fungal endophytes are adapted to cold stress in Antarctica.

AB  - We utilized an automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) method as a more rapid alternative to classical morphological/nutritional identification and a less expensive alternative to sequencing for identification and grouping of isolates in culture-based fungal abundance studies. This method is well suited for the study of culturable Antarctic soil fungal communities where both abundance and diversity are relatively low. We optimized template concentration and verified the effect of primer selection from eight commonly used fungal polymerase chain reaction primers on ARISA chromatographs for 46 fungal species commonly isolated from south Victoria Land. A database of Antarctic fungal electropherograms was produced containing each of the species and was used as the first step in a tiered system for species identification. In addition, isolates containing more than one species were identified, allowing isolates not in the database to be sequenced for further analysis. This method unambiguously identified 78% of the fungal taxa in this study and we were able to rapidly determine which isolates should be subjected to further analysis by DNA sequencing. Using this approach, the cost of analysis for abundance studies can be greatly reduced compared to DNA sequencing of each isolate.

AB  - Some of the coldest and driest permafrost soils on Earth are located in the high-elevation McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica, but little is known about the permafrost microbial communities other than that microorganisms are present in these valleys. Here, we describe the microbiology and habitable conditions of highly unique dry and ice-cemented permafrost in University Valley, one of the coldest and driest regions in the MDVs (1700 m above sea level; mean temperature -23 degrees C; no degree days above freezing), where the ice in permafrost originates from vapour deposition rather than liquid water. We found that culturable and total microbial biomass in University Valley was extremely low, and microbial activity under ambient conditions was undetectable. Our results contrast with reports from the lower-elevation Dry Valleys and Arctic permafrost soils where active microbial populations are found, suggesting that the combination of severe cold, aridity, oligotrophy of University Valley permafrost soils severely limit microbial activity and survival.

AB  - Iron is the fourth most abundant element on earth. However, its low bioavailability is a key plant-growth limiting factor. Bacteria play an important role in plant growth promotion since they produce specific secondary metabolites that may increase macro- and micronutrient accessibility in soil. Therefore, bacterial-derived iron chelators, as well as surface-active compounds, are recognised as essential to plant welfare. In this study, three cold-active Antarctic bacterial strains, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. ANT_H12B, Psychrobacter sp. ANT_H59 and Bacillus sp. ANT_WA51, were analysed. The physiological and genomic characterisation of these strains revealed their potential for plant growth promotion, reflected in the production of various biomolecules, including biosurfactants (that may lower the medium surface tension of even up to 53%) and siderophores (including ANT_H12B-produced mixed-type siderophore that demonstrated the highest production, reaching the concentration of up to 1.065 mM), increasing the availability of nutrients in the environment and neutralising fungal pathogens. Tested bacteria demonstrated an ability to promote the growth of a model plant, alfalfa, increasing shoots' length and fresh biomass even up to 26 and 46% respectively; while their metabolites increased the bioavailability of iron in soil up to 40%. It was also revealed that the introduced strains did not disrupt physicochemical conditions and indigenous soil microbial composition, which suggests that they are promising amendments preserving the natural biodiversity of soil and increasing its fertility.

AB  - A Gram-stain-negative, yellow-pigmented, non-flagellated, gliding, rod-shaped, oxidase-negative and catalase-positive bacterium, designated SE14(T), was isolated from soil on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Strain SE14(T) grew at 4-25 degrees C (optimum, 20 degrees C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0-7.5) and with 0-3.0% NaCl (optimum, 1.0-1.5 %), and could not produce flexirubin-type pigments. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed the the isolate belonged to the genus Flavobacterium. Strain SE14(T) had the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Flavobacterium antarcticum, F. tegetincola and F. degerlachei with 95.8, 95.5 and 95.2 %, respectively. The strain SE14(T) consisted of a clade with Flavobacterium noncentrifugens (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 94.9 %) and F. qiangtangense (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 94.2 %) and simultaneously formed a distinct phyletic lineage in the neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree. Polar lipids of the strain included phosphatidylethanolamine and four unidentified aminolipids. Strain SE14(T) contained anteiso-C-15 : 0, iso-C-15 : 0 and a mixture of iso-C-15 : 0 2-OH and/or C-16 : 1 omega 7c as the main fatty acids, and the only respiratory quinone was menaquinone-6. The genomic DNA G+C content was 42.3 mol%. The polyphasic taxonomic study revealed that strain SE14(T) belongs to a novel species within the genus Flavobacterium, and the name Flavobacterium phocarum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SE14(T) (=CCTCC AB 2017225(T)=KCTC 52612(T)).

AB  - The Antarctic continent hosts heterogeneous regions, which are in general exposed to extreme conditions, mainly low temperatures. Thus, microorganisms that thrive in this environment are supposed to harbor a metabolic versatility of great biotechnological interest, which includes the production of cold-adapted enzymes. The present study aimed to investigate chitinase production by bacteria isolated from marine and terrestrial samples from the Maritime Antarctica. For this, a collection of 560 bacteria was evaluated. Seventy-three (13%) isolates, belonging to 13 bacterial genera affiliated to Proteobacteria (6), Actinobacteria (4) and Firmicutes (3), were positive in preliminary assays, and twenty strains were further selected based on individual plate assays at 5 and 15 degrees C. These strains were identified such as Arthrobacter psychrochitiniphilus, Arthrobacter cryoconite and Curto bacterium luteum, all belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria. The best chitinase producer was A. psychrochitiniphilus 492, which showed 43.39 U/L in 80 h of incubation. After optimization of nine independent variables by Plackett-Burman experimental design, followed by a fractional factorial (25-1) and a central composite design (CCD) 23, the best condition for chitinase production was achieved using yeast extract 1.0 g/L, NH4NO3 2.0 g/L, colloidal chitin 5.0% and initial pH 6.0, which allowed an increase of 7.7-fold in chitinase production as compared with the initial condition without optimiza tion. Results gathered herein reinforce the Antarctic environment as a rich source for chitinase prospecting and open perspectives for further optimization strategies aiming future biotechnological application of such molecules in ecologically-friendly and sustainable processes.

AB  - A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, yellow-pigmented, non-flagellated, non-gliding, rod-like, oxidase- and catalase-positive bacterium, designated A2-1(T), was isolated from soil on Ardley Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Strain A2-1(T) grew at 4-22 degrees C (optimum, 10 degrees C), at pH 6.0- 8.0 (optimum, pH 6.5) and with 0-1.5% NaCl (optimum, 0.5 %), but could not produce flexirubin-type pigments. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the isolates belonged to the genus Flavobacterium. Strain A2-1(T) had the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Flavobacterium cucumis, F. ahnfeltiae and F. cheniae with 95.7, 95.6 and 95.4 %, respectively. The strain A2-1(T) consisted of a clade with F. cucumis and F. cheniae and simultaneously formed a distinct phyletic lineage in the neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree. Polar lipids of the strain included phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), four unidentified aminolipids and one unidentified lipid. The strain A2-1(T) contained anteiso-C-15:0 (20.2 %), iso-C-15:0 (16.2 %) and C-15:1 G (11.0 %) as the main fatty acids and the only respiratory quinone was menaquinone MK-6. The genomic DNA G+C content was 34.0 mol%. The polyphasic taxonomic study revealed that the strain A2-1(T) belongs to a novel species within the genus Flavobacterium and the name Flavobacterium ardleyense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A2-1(T) (=CCTCC AB 2017157(T)=KCTC 52644(T)).

AB  - Evaporitic deposits are a globally widespread habitat for micro-organisms. The microbe-mineral environment in weathered and remobilized gypsum from exposed mid-Ordovician marine evaporite beds in the polar desert of Devon Island, Nunavut, Canadian High Arctic was examined. The gypsum is characterized by internal green zones of cyanobacterial colonization (dominated by Gloeocapsa/Aphanothece and Chroococcidiopsis spp. morphotypes) and abundant black zones, visible from the surface, that contain pigmented cyanobacteria and fungi. Bioessential elements in the gypsum are primarily provided by allochthonous material from the present-day polar desert. The disruption, uplift and rotation of the evaporite beds by the Haughton meteorite impact 39 Ma have facilitated gypsum weathering and its accessibility as a habitat. No cultured cyanobacteria, bacteria and fungi were halophilic consistent with the expectation that halophily is not required to persist in gypsum habitats. Heterotrophic bacteria from the evaporite were slightly or moderately halotolerant, as were heterotrophs isolated from soil near the gypsum outcrop showing that halotolerance is common in arctic bacteria in this location. Psychrotolerant Arthrobacter species were isolated. No psychrophilic organisms were isolated. Two Arthrobacter isolates from the evaporite were used to mediate gypsum neogenesis in the laboratory, demonstrating a potential role for microbial biomineralization processes in polar environments.

AB  - We molecularly assesed the ascomycetous fungal communities inhabiting the rhizoid environment of Cephaloziella varians, collected at Rothera Point on the western Antarctic Peninsula. The RFLP-phenotyped and cloned PCR products of a partial small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene were sequenced and analyzed with neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP). Both analyses identified four bootstrap-supported groups: (i) a sister group to Onygenales, (ii) a well-supported clade with Phialocephala fortinii, (iii) a large group of clones nested within Chaetothyriales, and (iv) a group nested within Eurotiales with a likely affinity to the genus Aspergillus. An additional marginally supported clade, including helotialean Hymenostyphus fructigenus, was detected in the NJ analysis. Placement of one clone (possibly helotialean) was not supported by either analysis. We included Hymenoscyphus ericae (Helotiales) in our analyses to test for its presence in clone libraries. None of our clones showed strongly supported affinity to H. ericae. The culture-independent technique proved useful for assessing the composition of rhizoid fungal communities, although it remains unknown whether any of these fungi colonize C varians tissues. Direct-community assays of this kind might be best combined with traditional isolation techniques to get a more holistic view of fungi occupying plant tissues.

TI  - THE ROLE OF PROTEINS IN THE NITROGEN NUTRITION OF ECTOMYCORRHIZAL PLANTS .3. PROTEIN-UTILIZATION BY BETULA, PICEA AND PINUS IN MYCORRHIZAL ASSOCIATION WITH HEBELOMA-CRUSTULINIFORME
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
LA  - English
AB  - The ability of four major species of trees of boreal forests, Betula pendula, Picea mariana, P. sitchensis and Pinus contorta, to utilize protein as a sole nitrogen source was compared when the plants were grown in mycorrhizal association with the fungus Hebeloma crustuliniforme and in the non-mycorrhizal condition. When mycorrhizal, all species used protein N readily, producing vigorous shoots with nitrogen contents ranging from 5% in birch to around 3% in the conifers, and consuming  up to 53% of the nitrogen provided in the culture vessels. In the absence of infection birch, black spruce and pine were completely unable to use protein as an N source and Sitka spruce had only a minimal ability to do so. It is sugguested that early infection by fungi with proteolytic capability may be of particular importance for small seeded species germinating in soils of boreal and arctic regions where mineralization of nitrogen is inhibited by low temperatures.

AB  - The bacterium, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Pc3, was previously isolated from Antarctic seawater and has been found to show antagonistic activity against the fungus, Rhizoctonia solani ACCC 36316, which causes a severe disease known as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in rapeseed plants. Bacillus lipopeptides had been widely used as biocontrol agents for plant diseases. In this study, we isolated 11 lipopeptide compounds from B. amyloliquefaciens Pc3 culture broth via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to identify these as iturin A (C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17), fengycin B (C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17), and surfactin (C-14, C-15, C-16). We further found that the addition of exogenous alkanoic acids, including myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, heptadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, and nonadecanoic acid, to the bacterial growth media could promote lipopeptide production and enhance the antifungal activities of crude lipopeptide extracts from B. amyloliquefaciens Pc3. In addition, the transcriptional levels of three lipopeptide synthesis genes, ituD, fenA, and srfA-A, and two fatty acid metabolism-related genes, FabI, which encodes enoyl-ACP reductase, and FadB, which encodes enoyl-CoA hydratase, were found to be upregulated in cells grown with exogenous alkanoic acids. Among the six alkanoic acids tested, those with odd carbon chain lengths had a greater effect on lipopeptide production, antifungal activity, and target gene upregulation than those with even carbon chain lengths. These results provide a practical approach for the efficient production of lipopeptides in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Pc3.

AB  - From undisturbed Antarctic habitats (permafrost sediments 30-150 thousand years of age, water of Radok Lake) and superficial deposits contaminated with petroleum products, we isolated 14 and 9 strains of Penicillium fungi, respectively. Comparison of the fungal complexes showed them to differ by species composition; only two species-P. palitans and P. solitum-were in the species lists of both groups. The identified secondary metabolites in the investigated strains belonged to diketopiperazine (group of roquefortines, rugulosuvin B), benzodiazepine (anacin, cyclopenins), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatins), clavine ergot alkaloids (alpha-cyclopiazonic acid, festuclavine, fumigaclavines), polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B, chaetoglobosin A), amino acid derivatives (N-acetyltryptamine, chrysogins, penicillin G), polyketides (citreoviridin A, mycophenolic acid), and terpenes (andrastins, phomenone). Strains isolated from anthropogenically altered habitats produced a more complete and characteristic profile of exometabolites, as compared with strains isolated from undisturbed habitats. It is only from contaminated soils there were isolated fungi that produced more structurally diverse secondary metabolites pertaining to polycyclic indole alkaloids and terpenoids. The fungi isolated from contaminated samples can be used in biodegradation of oil spills and bioremediation of the environment, and also as producers of promising biologically active compounds.

AB  - Various microbial groups are well known to produce a range of extracellular enzymes and other secondary metabolites. However, the occurrence and importance of investment in such activities have received relatively limited attention in studies of Antarctic soil microbiota. In order to examine extracellular enzyme production in this chronically low-temperature environment, fungi were isolated from ornithogenic, pristine and human-impacted soils collected from the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica during the austral summer in February 2007. Twenty-eight isolates of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant fungi were obtained and screened at a culture temperature of 4 degrees C for activity of extracellular hydrolase enzymes (amylase, cellulase, protease), using R2A agar plates supplemented with (a) starch for amylase activity, (b) carboxymethyl cellulose and trypan blue for cellulase activity or (c) skim milk for protease activity. Sixteen isolates showed activity for amylase, 23 for cellulase and 21 for protease. One isolate showed significant activity across all three enzyme types, and a further 10 isolates showed significant activity for at least two of the enzymes. No clear associations were apparent between the fungal taxa isolated and the type of source soil, or in the balance of production of different extracellular enzymes between the different soil habitats sampled. Investment in extracellular enzyme production is clearly an important element of the survival strategy of these fungi in maritime Antarctic soils.

AB  - The main objective of the ongoing and future space exploration missions is the search for traces of extant or extinct life (biomarkers) on Mars. One of the main limiting factors on the survival of Earth-like life is the presence of harmful space radiation, that could damage or modify also biomolecules, therefore understanding the effects of radiation on terrestrial biomolecules stability and detectability is of utmost importance. Which terrestrial molecules could be preserved in a Martian radiation scenario? Here, we investigated the potential endurance of fungal biomolecules, by exposing de-hydrated colonies of the Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus mixed with Antarctic sandstone and with two Martian regolith analogues to increasing doses (0, 250 and 1000 Gy) of accelerated ions, namely iron (Fe), argon (Ar) and helium (He) ions. We analyzed the feasibility

AB  - Microbial biomass, diversity of culturable bacteria and micromycetes, and the number of functional nitrogen cycle genes in the supraglacial systems of the Aldegonda and Bertil glaciers have been studied. The biomass of microorganisms varies from 2.54 to 722 mu g/g substrate. It is shown for the first time that the major part (78.7-99.8%) of microbial biomass in supraglacial objects is represented by fungi rather than by prokaryotes, and the main part (70 to 90%) of the fungal biomass consists of mycelium with the length varying from 6.70 to 537.51 m/g substrate. The counts of prokaryotes vary from 2.4 x 10(8) to 1.95 x 10(9) cells/g substrate. The length of actinomycete mycelium falls into the range of 2.6-62.61 m/g substrate. The counts of culturable bacteria and actinomycetes vary from 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) CFU/g substrate and of micromycetes, from 2.2 x 10(1) to 1.7 x 10(4) CFU/g substrate. Bacteria of the genera Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and micromycetes of the genera Antarctomyces, Cadophora, Hyphozyma, Teberdinia and Thelebolus are dominants. The micromycetes Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Hyphozyma variabilis and Teberdinia hygrophila are found in Svalbard for the first time. The copy number of amoA genes in ammonium-oxidizing bacteria varies from 5.33 x 10(6) to 4.86 x 10(9)/g substrate; of nitrogen fixation genes nifH, from 9.89 x 10(7) to 9.81 x 10(10)/g substrate; and denitrification genes nirK, from 4.82 x 10(7) to 3.34 x 10(10)/g substrate. These results indirectly suggest the leading role of fungi in the microbiome of the supraglacial objects in Svalbard and a considerable contribution of prokaryotes to the emission of greenhouse gases there.

AB  - Juvenile development has been investigated for the first time in an Antarctic lichen species-Usnea antarctica-in the northern maritime Antarctic, Livingston Island (South Shetland Islands, 62degrees27'-62degrees48'S, 59degrees45'-61degrees15'W). Here, U. antarctica grows on rocks and forms the dominant vegetation on this site together with a few other macrolichens. This species reproduces mainly by vegetative diaspores (soredia), which include both the photobiont and the mycobiont. To understand the early ontogenetic strategies in U. antarctica, culture experiments were performed in an Antarctic field site where the species occurs naturally. This paper focuses on the different developmental steps seen between the initial colonization of soredia to the formation of a small well-developed thallus, and also on the growth rate of the respective juvenile stages. Compared with growth rates of lichens from temperate European regions the early development of U. antarctica is extraordinarily slow, taking 5-6 years until an adult thallus has been formed. The low photobiont content in the juvenile stages probably limits the growth rate. It is suggested that juvenile development of U. antarctica is controlled by a combination of ecophysiological and morphological adaptations that are required for success in extreme environments such as the terrestrial habitats of the Antarctic.

AB  - In this study, extremophile fungal species isolated from pure loparite-containing sands and their tolerance/resistance to the lanthanides Ce and Nd were investigated. The loparite-containing sands were collected at the tailing dumps of an enterprise developing a unique polar deposit of niobium, tantalum and rare-earth elements (REEs) of the cerium group: the Lovozersky Mining and Processing Plant (MPP), located in the center of the Kola Peninsula (northwestern Russia). From the 15 fungal species found at the site, one of the most dominant isolates was identified by molecular analysis as the zygomycete fungus Umbelopsis isabellina (GenBank accession no. OQ165236). Fungal tolerance/resistance was evaluated using different concentrations of CeCl3 and NdCl3. Umbelopsis isabellina exhibited a higher degree of tolerance/resistance to cerium and neodymium than did the other dominant isolates (Aspergillus niveoglaucus, Geomyces vinaceus and Penicillium simplicissimum). The fungus began to be inhibited only after being exposed to 100 mg L-1 of NdCl3. The toxic effects of Ce were not observed in fungus growth until it was subjected to 500 mg center dot L-1 of CeCl3. Moreover, only U. isabellina started to grow after extreme treatment with 1000 mg center dot L-1 of CeCl3 one month after inoculation. This work indicates, for the first time, the potential of Umbelopsis isabellina to remove REEs from the loparite ore tailings, making it a suitable candidate for the development of bioleaching methods.

AB  - Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae, together with bacteria and fungi, ale known to be primary colonizers of mineral soils throughout Antarctica. Their species diversity and soil coverage were studied in 18 soil polygons located at Cierva. Point, Antarctic Peninsula. Undisturbed assemblages were dominated by filamentous Cyanobacteria and cliatoms, whilst almost 40% of the 49 species recorded were observed only after enrichment culture. Nearly all of the isolates from enrichment cultures were Chlorophyta and Tribophyceae. This revealed a higher degree of complexity than reported for similar communities on Signy Island. Water content and concentrations of nutrients were determined at four representative sites, and did not appear to account for the large inter-polygon variation found in species composition and relative frequencies of occurrence. Variables describing community development were not significantly correlated with either area of the polygons or the minimum distance between them. This suggested that these features are not an important short-range barrier to dispersal for those "weed" species dominating the community. Conversely, the relative frequencies of some of the most common species showed significant correlations with species diversity and soil coverage, and it is suggested that biotic interactions could account to a larger extent for community structure than previously reported from Signy Island fellfields.

AB  - Numerous studies have recognized a biogeographic boundary (i.e., Blakiston's Line) between Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan, where the Tsugaru Strait probably functions as a geographic barrier to the movement of terrestrial species. To clarify if this biogeographic boundary applies to soil microbes, we examined community structures of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi across the Tsugaru Strait. We sampled 266 soil cores from six conifer-dominated forests, and collected EM roots for fungal species identification based on internal transcribed spacer sequences. We found that EM fungal communities were primarily influenced by contemporary climate, but not significantly by the geographic barrier or spatial distance. Fungal OTUs appeared to be widespread in the Holarctic regions, suggesting long-distance dispersal capabilities or ancient migrations before the separation of Japanese islands from the continent. The significant effects of climate in this and previous studies imply that EM fungal communities may be sensitive to future climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

AB  - Mycena s.s. is a ubiquitous mushroom genus whose members degrade multiple dead plant substrates and opportunistically invade living plant roots. Having sequenced the nuclear genomes of 24 Mycena species, we find them to defy the expected patterns for fungi based on both their traditionally perceived saprotrophic ecology and substrate specializations. Mycena displayed massive genome expansions overall affecting all gene families, driven by novel gene family emergence, gene duplications, enlarged secretomes encoding polysaccharide degradation enzymes, transposable element (TE) proliferation, and horizontal gene transfers. Mainly due to TE proliferation, Arctic Mycena species display genomes of up to 502 Mbp (2-83 3 the temperate Mycena), the largest among mushroom-forming Agaricomycetes, indicating a possible evolutionary convergence to genomic expansions sometimes seen in Arctic plants. Overall, Mycena show highly unusual, varied mosaic-like genomic structures adaptable to multiple lifestyles, providing genomic illustration for the growing realization that fungal niche adaptations can be far more fluid than traditionally believed.

AB  - The harsh climatic conditions and low levels of human activity in Antarctica, relative to other regions, means few non-native species have established. However, the risk of introductions is becoming greater as human activity increases. Non-native microorganisms can be imported to Antarctica in association with fresh food, cargo and personal clothing, but the likelihood of their establishment is not well understood. In January 2015, a wooden packing crate, heavily contaminated with fungi, was imported by aircraft from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Rothera Research Station, Antarctica. Mucor racemosus Bull. and two strains of Trichoderma viridescens (A.S. Horne & H.S. Will.) Jaklitsch & Samuels were isolated from the wood. Measurements of hyphal extension rates indicated that all three strains were psychrotolerant and capable of growth at 4 degrees C, with M. racemosus growing at 0 degrees C. The imported fungi could grow at rates equivalent to, or faster than, species isolated from Antarctic soils, suggesting that low temperature may not be a limiting factor for establishment. It is recommended that wood heat-treatment standards, equivalent to those described in the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, are employed by national operators importing cargo into Antarctica, and that treated wood is adequately stored to prevent fungal contamination prior to transportation.

AB  - Dark septate root endophytes (DSE) are an artificial assemblage of fungi that have darkly pigmented, septate hyphae and that are frequent or distinctive intracellular associates of roots of apparently healthy plants. Based oil isolates obtained from the roots of Salix spp., the distribution of a common DSE fungus, Phialocephala fortinii, was examined along a latitudinal transect in Canada running from the high arctic to the 49degrees N parallel. Non-sporulating isolates were provisionally identified as P.fortinii through analysis of DNA sequence data of the ITS2 region of rDNA. P. fortinii was isolated frequently from boreal and arctic habitats, but rarely from grassland habitats. Patterns of genetic variation were examined through analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). All AFLP profiles were unique with the majority of genetic variation occurring among individuals within the collecting sites at each latitude. Neighbour-joining analysis of genetic distances yielded eight well-supported clusters, three of which included individuals from more than one latitude. Some linkage disequilibrium, possibly due to partial clonality, was detected.

AB  - Desiccation tolerance is a feature of most lichens. These symbiotic associations of a fungal partner (mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (photobiont) experience severe desiccation on a regular basis. Many lichen species colonise extreme habitats, such as the cold deserts of Antarctica. Although the stress physiology of lichens has been studied extensively, little is known about the photobionts' physiological potential. To assess the contribution of photobionts to lichen success in Antarctic terrestrial environments, the photosynthetic partners of Umbilicaria decussata (Umbilicariaceae, lichenised ascomycetes) and Usnea lambii (Parmeliaceae, lichenised ascomycetes) from extreme habitats in southern Antarctica were isolated. Significant differences regarding stress tolerance of the two green algae had been shown previously despite their close phylogenetic relationship. A deeper understanding and explanation of these differences were obtained by examination of the metabolite profiles and dynamics, especially the role of sugars, polyols and amino acids. High concentrations of ribitol and sucrose, among other metabolites, characterised the photobiont of Usnea lambii's mainly constitutive strategy of desiccation tolerance. A high degree of specialisation to dry environments can be assumed for this photobiont.

AB  - Microfungi were isolated from different moss species in Victoria Land. Twenty-eight taxa belonging to 18 genera were identified. New records for continental Antarctica were: Arthrobotrys superba, Conidiobolus sp., Penicillium minioluteum, Verticillium psalliotae and V. lamellicola. The most frequently isolated fungal species were: Cladosporium cladosporioides, Cryptococcus albidus, Cryptococcus laurentii, Geomyces pannorum var. pannorum, G. pannorum var. vinaceus, Mortierella antarctica, Cadophora malorum, Phoma herbarum and F. lecanii. Bryum pseudotriquetrum was the moss richest in fungal species. Within the Antarctic environment, moss is one of the microhabitats richest in microfungi, particularly in psychrophilic indigenous species.

AB  - Humicolopsis cephalosporioides is a soil fungus that is associated with Nothofagus forests in South America. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of environmental factors such as temperature, light, and nutrition on chlamydospore differentiation as well as pigment biosynthesis. Temperature did not affect chlamydospore production; it rather altered pigmentation development that also was affected by light. The composition of culture media as well as light modulated chlamydospore differentiation. Microscope observations, spectroscopic analysis as well as culture assays, using melanin inhibitors, suggest that the main pigment of chlamydospores of H. cephalosporioides is 1,8 dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin-type compound. Furthermore, we found that the genome of H. cephalosporioides contains a sequence highly homologous to the pks sequences of other fungi that have been associated with the biosynthesis of 1,8 DHN-melanin. All this together suggests that melanization is among the most important features linked to survival of this fungus in the soils of Nothofagus forests in sub-Antarctica region and that the ITS, 18S, and 28S rDNA sequences did not provide enough information to delineate the phylogenetic relationships of the fungus within the class Leotiomycetes.

AB  - Bradyrhizobia and rhizobia are symbiotic bacterial partners forming nitrogen fixing nodules on legumes. These bacteria share characteristics with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Nodule inducing bacteria, like other PGPR, are capable of colonizing the roots of non-legumes and produce phytohormones, siderophores and HCN. They also exhibit antagonistic effects towards many plant pathogenic fungi. The potential of nodule inducing bacteria to function as PGPR, was examined by using radish as a model plant. Three percent of the 266 strains tested were found to be cyanogens, while a majority (83%) produced siderophores. Fifty eight percent of the strains produced indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and 54% solubilized phosphorus. Some of the bacterial species examined were found to have a deleterious effect while others were neutral or displayed a stimulatory effect on radishes. Bradyrizobium japonicum strain Soy 213 was found to have the highest stimulatory effect (60%), and an arctic strain (N44) was the most deleterious, causing a 44% reduction in radish dry matter yield. A second plant inoculation test, performed in growth cabinets, revealed that only strain Tal 629 of B. japonicum significantly increased (15%) the dry matter yield of radish. This indicates that specific bradyrhizobia have the potential to be used as PGPR on non-legumes.

AB  - Among the celestial bodies in the Solar System, Mars currently represents the main target for the search for life beyond Earth. However, its surface is constantly exposed to high doses of cosmic rays (CRs) that may pose a threat to any biological system. For this reason, investigations into the limits of resistance of life to space relevant radiation is fundamental to speculate on the chance of finding extraterrestrial organisms on Mars. In the present work, as part of the STARLIFE project, the responses of dried colonies of the black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus Culture Collection of Fungi from Extreme Environments (CCFEE) 515 to the exposure to accelerated iron (LET: 200 keV/mu m) ions, which mimic part of CRs spectrum, were investigated. Samples were exposed to the iron ions up to 1000 Gy in the presence of Martian regolith analogues. Our results showed an extraordinary resistance of the fungus in terms of survival, recovery of metabolic activity and DNA integrity. These experiments give new insights into the survival probability of possible terrestrial-like life forms on the present or past Martian surface and shallow subsurface environments.

AB  - Preparation of (S)-1-chloro-2-octanol and (S)-1-bromo-2-octanol was carried out by the enzymatic hydrolysis of halohydrin palmitates using biocatalysts. Halohydrin palmitates were prepared by various methods from palmitic acid and 1,2-octanediol. A tandem hydrolysis was carried out using lipases from Candida antarctica (Novozym (R) 435), Rhizomucor miehei (Lipozyme IM), and "resting cells" from a Rhizopus oryzae strain that was not mycotoxigenic. The influence of the enzyme and the reaction medium on the selective hydrolysis of isomeric mixtures of halohydrin esters is described. Novozym (R) 435 allowed preparation of (S)-1-chloro-2-octanol and (S)-1-bromo-2-octanol after 1-3 h of reaction at 40 degrees C in [BMIM][PF6].

AB  - A new black yeast species, Exophiala macquariensis is described that is a member of the ascomycete family Herpotrichiellaceae, order Chaetothyriales. The genus Exophiala is comprised of opportunistic pathogens isolated from clinical specimens as well as species recovered from hydrocarbon contaminated environments. Several species have been reported to be able to degrade benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. Here, a novel species of Exophiala (CZ06) previously isolated from a Sub-Antarctic, Macquarie Island soil that was spiked with Special Antarctic Blend diesel fuel (SAB) is described. This isolate has the capacity of toluene biodegradation at cold temperatures. Multilocus sequence typing showed that this fungus was closely related to the pathogenic species Exophiala salmonis and Exophiala equina. With the capacity to utilise hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source at 10 degrees C, this fungus has great potential for future bioremediation applications. (C) 2018 British Mycological Society.

AB  - To date over 1 000 non-lichenized fungal species have been recorded by collection or isolation from Antarctica, and additional taxa are now being identified by molecular studies. The number and variety of species recorded so far suggest that the fungi may be the most diverse biota in the Antarctic, and the additional taxa identified by molecular surveys suggest that the true diversity may be far greater than is currently estimated. Fungi occupy many different ecological niches in the Antarctic, and their significance in these niches is only poorly understood. The majority of species described from the region have been identified as members of broadly cosmopolitan groups, but there is some evidence for both endemic strains and populations. This review brings together the current broad systematic and ecological findings for the non-lichenized Antarctic fungi. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

AB  - Although investigators have been studying the cold-shock response in a variety of organisms for the last two decades or more, comparatively little is known about the difference between antioxidant cell response to cold stress in Antarctic and temperate microorganisms. The change of environmental temperature, which is one of the most common stresses, could be crucial for their use in the biotechnological industry and in ecological research. We compared the effect of short-term temperature downshift on antioxidant cell response in Antarctic and temperate fungi belonging to the genus Penicillium. Our study showed that downshift from an optimal temperature to 15A degrees or 6A degrees C led to a cell response typical of oxidative stress: significant reduction of biomass production; increase in the levels of oxidative damaged proteins and accumulation of storage carbohydrates (glycogen and trehalose) in comparison to growth at optimal temperature. Cell response against cold stress includes also increase in the activities of SOD and CAT, which are key enzymes for directly scavenging reactive oxygen species. This response is more species-dependent than dependent on the degree of cold-shock. Antarctic psychrotolerant strain Penicillium olsonii p14 that is adapted to life in extremely cold conditions demonstrated enhanced tolerance to temperature downshift in comparison with both mesophilic strains (Antarctic Penicillium waksmanii m12 and temperate Penicillium sp. t35).

AB  - Introduction In the extremely dry and oligotrophic soils of East Antarctica, where low temperatures and humidity result in minimal biological turnover rates, extracellular DNA (eDNA) can persist over extended timescales. Differentiating between sequences from living, potentially active cells (intracellular DNA, or iDNA) and those from ancient, non-living organisms (eDNA) is crucial for accurately assessing the current microbial community and understanding historical microbial dynamics.Methods This study was conducted along a chronosequence in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, where soil samples were collected from sites at varying distances from the glacier. By employing DNA separation methods, we distinguished iDNA, which represents living cells, from eDNA derived from dead organisms. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize bacterial and eukaryotic communities across different successional stages.Results The DNA separation approach revealed distinct bacterial and eukaryotic community structures along the glacier transect. Actinobacteria were consistently abundant across all sites, while other phyla such as Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria thrived in extreme, nutrient-poor environments. Early successional stages were characterized by the simultaneous colonization of green algae Trebouxiophyceae and cryophilic fungi, alongside nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which contributed to initial soil development. The study also identified three distinct modes of microbial distribution, reflecting varying degrees of activity and adaptability.Discussion Our findings provide new insights into microbial dynamics in extreme habitats and propose new hypotheses for microbial colonization in newly exposed soils. Moreover, they contribute to the ongoing debate in microbial ecology regarding the viability of dormant or dead cells and emphasize the need for refining DNA-based methods and exploring functional pathways to deepen our understanding of microbial succession in polar regions.

AB  - Understanding the regeneration and succession of belowground communities, particularly in forests, is vital for maintaining ecosystem health. Despite its importance, there is limited knowledge regarding how fungal communities change over time during ecosystem development, especially under different forest restoration strategies. In this study, we focused on two restoration methods used in northern Japan: monoculture planting and natural regeneration. We examined the responses of the fungal community to monoculture plantations (active tree planting) and naturally regenerated (passive regeneration) forests over a 50-year chronosequence, using natural forests as a reference. Based on DNA metabarcoding, we assessed the richness of fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and their dissimilarity. Our findings revealed that soil fungal richness remained stable after natural regeneration but declined in monoculture plantations, from 354 to 247 OTUs. While the compositional dissimilarity of fungal assemblages between monoculture plantations and natural forests remained consistent regardless of the time since tree planting, it significantly decreased after natural regeneration, suggesting recovery to a state close to the reference level. Notably, the composition of key functional fungal groups-saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal- has increasingly mirrored that of natural forests over time following passive natural regeneration. In summary, our study suggests that monoculture plantations may not be effective for long-term ecosystem function and service recovery because of their limited support for soil fungal diversity. These results underscore the importance of natural regeneration in forest restoration and management strategies.

AB  - Throughout the history of polar exploration and up to recent times, wood and other exotic materials have been brought to the Antarctic continent and left there. While the possible transportation of exotic fungal species on these materials is sometimes considered, the effects of these exotic substrates on indigenous fungal communities have not been previously evaluated. This study reports results from seven plots where organic materials were used in baiting studies to determine the fungal diversity present in soils. Four plots were on islands in the Palmer Archipelago on the Antarctic Peninsula and three at Ross Island, Antarctica. Samples of sterile wood and cellulose with and without nutrients added were buried in soil and left for either two or four years before being removed and evaluated for fungal colonization. There was a significant increase in fungal colony-forming units (CFU) from soil in direct contact with introduced, sterile wood and cellulose substrates compared to background soil levels. The type of substrate, 2 or 4 year incubation period in the field, or nutrient addition did not have a significant effect on culturable densities in soil. Fungal abundance on soil adhering to substrates was found to be similar to that found in non-polar soils indicating that lack of organic material may be the most significant limiting factor affecting densities of Antarctic fungal populations. Based on a high degree of colonization, these exotic substrates appear to have a significant effect on indigenous soil fungal abundance.

AB  - Microbial communities in alpine environments >7,500 m.a.s.l. have not been well studied using modern cultivation-independent sequencing approaches due to the challenges and danger associated with reaching such high elevations. For this reason, we know little about the microorganisms found in sediments on Earth's tallest mountains, how they reach these surfaces, and how they survive and remain active at such extreme elevations. Here, we explore the microbial diversity recovered from three sediment samples collected from the South Col (similar to 7,900 m.a.s.l.) of Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) using both culturing and next generation sequencing approaches (16S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer [ITS] region, and 18S rRNA gene sequencing). Both approaches detected very low diversity of bacteria, protists, and fungi that included a combination of cosmopolitan taxa and specialized microorganisms often found at high elevations like those of the genera Modestobacter and Naganishia. Though we managed to grow viable cultures of many of these taxa, it remains likely that few, if any, can be active in situ at the South Col. Instead, these high-elevation surfaces may act as deep-freeze collection zones of organisms deposited from the atmosphere or left by climbers scaling the Earth's highest mountain.

AB  - The ongoing search for effective antiplasmodial agents remains essential in the fight against malaria worldwide. Emerging parasitic drug resistance places an urgent need to explore chemotherapies with novel structures and mechanisms of action. Natural products have historically provided effective antimalarial drug scaffolds. In an effort to search nature's chemical potential for antiplasmodial agents, unconventionally sourced organisms coupled with innovative cultivation techniques were utilized. Approximately 60,000 niche microbes from various habitats (slow-growing terrestrial fungi, Antarctic microbes, and mangrove endophytes) were cultivated on a small-scale, extracted, and used in high-throughput screening to determine antimalarial activity. About 1% of crude extracts were considered active and 6% partially active (67% inhibition at 5 and 50 g/mL, respectively). Active extracts (685) were cultivated on a large-scale, fractionated, and screened for both antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity. High interest fractions (397) with an IC50 < 1.11 g/mL were identified and subjected to chromatographic separation for compound characterization and dereplication. Identifying active compounds with nanomolar antimalarial activity coupled with a selectivity index tenfold higher was accomplished with two of the 52 compounds isolated. This microscale, high-throughput screening project for antiplasmodial agents is discussed in the context of current natural product drug discovery efforts.

AB  - Simple Summary We investigated the environmental DNA fungal diversity present in cores of Oligocene rocks from Antarctica using a DNA metabarcoding approach. After eDNA extraction and analysis, we identified 198 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycota, Rozellomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Zoopagomycota, Aphelidiomycota (Fungi), and the fungal-like Oomycota (Stramenopila). The dominant taxa detected were Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Aspergillaceae sp., and Diaporthaceae sp. We also detected 22 fungal ASVs as intermediate and 170 as minor components of the assigned fungal diversity. The samples displayed a high fungal diversity; however, rarefaction analysis suggested that further diversity remains to be detected. The endolithic fungal community detected contains a rich and complex mycobiome comprising taxa with different lifestyles, comparable to the diversity reported in other Antarctic habitats. Our results suggest the need for further research to develop strategies for isolating these fungi into culture for evolutionary, physiological, and biogeochemical studies, and to assess their potential roles in biotechnological applications.Abstract In this study, we evaluated the fungal diversity present associated with cores of Oligocene rocks using a DNA metabarcoding approach. We detected 940,969 DNA reads grouped into 198 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycota, Rozellomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Zoopagomycota, Aphelidiomycota (Fungi) and the fungal-like Oomycota (Stramenopila), in rank abundance order. Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Aspergillaceae sp. and Diaporthaceae sp. were assessed to be dominant taxa, with 22 fungal ASVs displaying intermediate abundance and 170 being minor components of the assigned fungal diversity. The data obtained displayed high diversity indices, while rarefaction indicated that the majority of the diversity was detected. However, the diversity indices varied between the cores analysed. The endolithic fungal community detected using a metabarcoding approach in the Oligocene rock samples examined contains a rich and complex mycobiome comprising taxa with different lifestyles, comparable with the diversity reported in recent studies of a range of Antarctic habitats. Due to the high fungal diversity detected, our results suggest the necessity of further research to develop strategies to isolate these fungi in culture for evolutionary, physiological, and biogeochemical studies, and to assess their potential role in biotechnological applications.

AB  - The fungal strain, Penicillium griseofulvum P29, isolated from a soil sample taken from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, was found to be a good producer of sialidase (P29). The present study was focused on the purification and structural characterization of the enzyme. P29 enzyme was purified using a Q-Sepharose column and fast performance liquid chromatography separation on a Mono Q column. The determined molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 40 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 39924.40 Da by matrix desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis correlated well with the calculated mass (39903.75 kDa) from the amino acid sequence of the enzyme. P29 sialidase shows a temperature optimum of 37 degrees C and low-temperature stability, confirming its cold-active nature. The enzyme is more active towards alpha(2 -> 3) sialyl linkages than those containing alpha(2 -> 6) linkages.Based on the determined amino acid sequence and 3D structural modeling, a 3D model of P29 sialidase was presented, and the properties of the enzyme were explained. The conformational stability of the enzyme was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the new enzyme was found to be conformationally stable in the neutral pH range of pH 6 to pH 9. In addition, the enzyme was more stable in an alkaline environment than in an acidic environment. The purified cold-active enzyme is the only sialidase produced and characterized from Antarctic fungi to date.

AB  - We recovered 85 fungal isolates from the acid sulphate soils in chronosequence under para-periglacial conditions in King George Island, Antarctica. Thirty-two taxa belonging to the phylumAscomycota,BasidiomycotaandMortierellomycotawere identified.Mortierella amoeboidea,Mortierellasp. 2,Mortierellasp. 3,Penicilliumsp. 2 andPenicilliumsp. 3 dominated the sulphite soils. Despite the multi-extreme physic-chemical conditions of the sulphate soils (low pH, variable content of macro and micronutrients and organic matter), the fungal assemblages exhibited moderate diversity indices, which ranged according to the degree of soil development. Soils with more weathered and, consequently, with highest values of organic carbon shelter the most diverse fungal assemblages, which can be associated with the occurrence of sulphurisation and sulphide oxidation. Different taxa ofMortierellaandPenicilliumdisplayed broad pH (3-9) and temperature (5-35 degrees C) plasticity. The multi-extreme sulphite soils of Antarctica revealed the presence of moderate fungal diversity comprising cold cosmopolitan and psychrophilic endemic taxa. Among these,MortierellaandPenicillium, known to survive in extreme conditions such as low temperature and available organic matter, low pH and high concentrations of metals, might represent interesting techniques to be used in biotechnological processes such as bioleaching in metallurgy and phosphate solubilisation in agriculture.

AB  - Molecular biology techniques were used to identify 218 fungi from soil samples collected from four islands of Antarctica. These consisted of 22 taxa of 15 different genera belonging to the Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Mortierella, Antarctomyces, Pseudogymnoascus, and Penicillium were the most frequently isolated genera and Penicillium tardochrysogenum, Penicillium verrucosus, Goffeauzyma gilvescens, and Mortierella sp. 2 the most abundant taxa. All fungal isolates were cultivated using solid-state fermentation to obtain their crude extracts. Pseudogymnoascus destructans, Mortierella parvispora, and Penicillium chrysogenum displayed antiparasitic activities, whilst extracts of P. destructans, Mortierella amoeboidea, Mortierella sp. 3, and P. tardochrysogenum showed herbicidal activities. Reported as pathogenic for bats, different isolates of P. destructans exhibited trypanocidal activities and herbicidal activity, and may be a source of bioactive molecules to be considered for chemotherapy against neglected tropical diseases. The abundant presence of P. destructans in soils of the four islands gives evidence supporting that soils in the Antarctic Peninsula constitute a natural source of strains of this genus, including some P. destructans strains that are phylogenetically close to those that infect bats in North America and Europe/Palearctic Asia.

AB  - We surveyed the diversity and capability of producing bioactive compounds from a cultivable fungal community isolated from oligotrophic soil of continental Antarctica. A total of 115 fungal isolates were obtained and identified in 11 taxa of Aspergillus, Debaryomyces, Cladosporium, Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium and Hypocreales. The fungal community showed low diversity and richness, and high dominance indices. The extracts of Aspergillus sydowii, Penicillium allii-sativi, Penicillium brevicompactum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium rubens possess antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antitumoral, herbicidal and antiprotozoal activities. Bioactive extracts were examined using H-1 NMR spectroscopy and detected the presence of secondary metabolites with chemical shifts. Our results show that the fungi present in cold-oligotrophic soil from Antarctica included few dominant species, which may have important implications for understanding eukaryotic survival in cold-arid oligotrophic soils. We hypothesize that detailed further investigations may provide a greater understanding of the evolution of Antarctic fungi and their relationships with other organisms described in that region. Additionally, different wild pristine bioactive fungal isolates found in continental Antarctic soil may represent a unique source to discover prototype molecules for use in drug and biopesticide discovery studies.

AB  - Unicellular fungi, commonly referred to as yeasts, were found to be components of the culturable soil fungal population in Taylor Valley, Mt. Discovery, Wright Valley, and two mountain peaks of South Victoria Land, Antarctica. Samples were taken from sites spanning a diversity of soil habitats that were not directly associated with vertebrate activity. A large proportion of yeasts isolated in this study were basidiomycetous species (89%), of which 43% may represent undescribed species, demonstrating that culturable yeasts remain incompletely described in these polar desert soils. Cryptococcus species represented the most often isolated genus (33%) followed by Leucosporidium (22%). Principle component analysis and multiple linear regression using stepwise selection was used to model the relation between abiotic variables (principle component 1 and principle component 2 scores) and yeast biodiversity (the number of species present at a given site). These analyses identified soil pH and electrical conductivity as significant predictors of yeast biodiversity. Species-specific PCR primers were designed to rapidly discriminate among the Dioszegia and Leucosporidium species collected in this study.

AB  - In the present study, 10 soil samples were collected aseptically from an equal number of areas of the Antarctic in the zone occupied by the 1986-1987 Italian expedition for research on keratinophilic fungi. Of particular interest was the isolation of a pathogenic fungus, Microsporum gypseum, from two sites in the base camp occupied by man and by skuas. Trichophyton terrestre was isolated from a site in which people worked and through which penguins and skuas passed. The most widespread fungal species were members of the genus Chrysosporium. Some of these species were isolated but not identified and this part of the study was still to be completed. Another significant finding was the absence of fungi in one sample, while in another the widespread and abundant growth in all the seeded dishes of a single species of Chrysosporium. Other species in genera of general diffusion in many environments were also isolated: Aspergillus spp., Malbranchea sp., Mycelia sterila spp., Paecilomyces sp., Penicillium spp. and Scopulariopsis spp.

AB  - Primer selection and PCR methods can potentially lead to biased descriptions of microbial communities. Here, we investigated soil total fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community composition and diversity from diverse sites using several primers and amplification methods. The results showed that regardless of site, the ITS3tagmix1-5/ITS4ngs primer set generated a higher proportion of high-quality reads, targeted more fungal ASVs and revealed a higher total fungal alpha diversity compared to ITS3tagmix4/ITS4ngs. Among specific primers targeting the 18S rRNA gene, AMV4.5NF/AMDGR had differential specificity for Glomeraceae, whereas SSU515Fngs/Euk742R had differential specificity for Paraglomeraceae. Regardless of site, PCR approaches (nested vs non-nested) had higher influence on the AMF community structure than primer selection, though primer selection significantly influenced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi richness. Overall, the findings suggest that the specificity of amplification in relation to primer selection and PCR stringency should guide the best interpretation of fungal community diversity data from high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples.

AB  - Samples of horizons in paleosols from the Quartermain Mountains of the Antarctic Dry Valleys (Aztec and New Mountain areas) were analyzed for their physical characteristics, mineralogy, chemical composition, and microbiology to determine the accumulation and movement of salts and other soluble constituents and the presence/absence of microbial populations. Salt concentrations are of special interest because they are considered to be a function of age, derived over time, in part from nearby oceanic and high-altitude atmospheric sources. The chemical composition of ancient Mioceneage paleosols in these areas is the direct result of the deposition and weathering of airborne-influxed salts and other materials, as well as the weathering of till derived principally from local dolerite and sandstone outcrops. Paleosols nearer the coast have greater contents of Cl, whereas near the inland ice sheet, nitrogen tends to increase on a relative basis. The accumulation and vertical distribution of salts and other soluble chemical elements indicate relative amounts of movement in the profile over long periods of time, in the order of several million years.
   Four of the six selected subsamples from paleosol horizons in two ancient soil profiles contained nil concentrations of bacteria and fungi. However, two horizons at depths of between 3 and 8 cm, in two profiles, yielded several colonies of the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Penicillium brevicompactum, indicating very minor input of organic carbon. Beauveria bassiana is often reported in association with insects and is used commercially for the biological control of some insect pests. Penicillium species are commonly isolated from Arctic, temperate, and tropical soils and are known to utilize a wide variety of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds. The cold, dry soils of the Antarctic bear a close resemblance to various present and past martian environments where similar weathering could occur and possible microbial populations may exist.

AB  - Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) represents one of the two vascular plants that have colonized the Antarctic continent, which is usually exposed to extreme environmental conditions. In this work, we have characterized the endophytic fungi associated with the leaves of D. antarctica. Endophytic fungi were recovered from 91 individual plants from different points of Admiralty Bay at King George Island, Antarctica. A total of 26 fungal isolates were obtained from 273 leaf fragments. All isolates were identified by analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the rDNA. Alternaria and Phaeosphaeria were the most frequent genera associated with the plant. Other fungal isolates were identified as Entrophospora sp. and several undescribed Ascomycete species. An interesting result was obtained for the isolates UFMGCB 215 and UFMGCB 262, which were related to fungi associated with bryophytes present in boreal ecosystems. Some isolates showed low identity in the ITS sequences to sequences of fungal species deposited in GenBank, suggesting that these fungi could be new species. This work is the first report on fungal endophytes associated with leaves of the Antarctic grass D. antarctica.

AB  - Antarctica is a continent that presents extreme conditions for life. Numerous buildings that served as housing for expeditioners and scientists are considered historical heritage, including Casa Moneta Museum, located at the Orcadas Base on Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands (Antarctic Peninsula). It is built entirely of wood, and currently shows visible signs of deterioration. In this work, we studied the mycobiota present in the deteriorated wood of the museum to characterize the fungal diversity present. Macro-, micro-morphological and phylogenetic studies were carried out to identify the fungi isolated. Temperature tests were also performed to study the growth of different strains. Almost 20% of the fungi isolated belonged to Cadophora. Other frequently obtained genera were Tulasnella (16%), Cerinosterus (12%), Coniochaeta (7%), Geomyces (7%), Acremonium (7%) and Penicillium (7%). Temperature tests indicated all strains isolated are psychrotolerant. Five species have been reported for the first time for Antarctica. Deterioration of historic wooden structures and artifacts in extreme environments is currently causing great concern, and in this study the identification of the fungi present in Casa Moneta's wood and the characterization of their metabolism could be a guide to the development of preservation strategies for this historical building.

AB  - Lignin mineralization activity of three basidiomycetous litter-decomposing fungi (LDF) was studied with humus layer samples taken from a boreal forest soil. The total Pb concentration in the samples was 32,000 mg kg(-1) and water soluble Pb 67 mg kg(-1). Synthetic lignin mineralization by Collybia dryophila and Clitocybe (Lepista) nebularis was strongly inhibited, whereas Stropharia coronilla was more tolerant to Pb stress in soil and liquid Cultures. Purified laccases maintained their activity and purified MnPs remained partly active up to a concentration of 1450 mg Pb l(-1). High concentrations of Pb inhibited the growth of LDF and affected the activity of ligninolytic enzymes, but the extent of inhibition varied among different LDF species. In consequence, Pb contamination in soil may have a negative impact on recycling of organic carbon. (c) 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rhizopogon (Boletales) is an ectomycorrhizal fungal genus that exhibits a strong specificity to Pinaceae. This strict association occurs almost exclusively with Pinus and Pseudotsuga, while associations with other genera in Pinaceae are inconclusive. Here, we describe Rhizopogon laricinus sp. nov. associated with Larix cajanderi distributed in northeastern Siberia, where forest fires are frequent. We confirmed the host identity by comparing rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences obtained from basidiomata and ectomycorrhizal root tips collected at the same sites. Morphological characteristics and molecular identification revealed that R. laricinus is a new species associated with Larix unequivocally. The molecular phylogeny based on ITS sequences placed this species sister to the subgenus Roseoli, which is specific to Pinus, and not to the Pseudotsuga-specific subgenus Villosuli. Thus, R. laricinus evolution does not correspond to host phylogeny as Larix and Pseudotsuga form a monophyletic Glade. Instead, ecological traits of Rhizopogon for adapting to disturbed habitats may have driven the host shift to Larix under high-frequency fire ecosystems. (C) 2019 The Mycological Society of Japan.

AB  - A UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acid (324 nm-MAA), so far only known from the green macroalgal genus Prasiola (Trebouxiophyceae), was also identified in other morphologically diverse green algae closely related to Prasiola spp. in 18S rDNA phylogenies. Using HPLC, a second UV-absorbing compound was found only in Myrmecia incisa Reisigal among all studied strains. This substance showed an absorption maximum at 322 nm and hence was designated as putative 322 nm-MAA. Preliminary UV-exposure experiments indicated that all species containing one or the other MAA showed a strong accumulation of the respective compound, thus supporting their function as putative UV sunscreen. Both UV-absorbing substances were only identified in the studied members of the Trebouxiophyceae but were absent in members of the Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae. When mapped on an 18S rDNA phylogeny, the distribution of 324 nm-MAA was found to be scattered within the Trebouxiophyceae but was consistent with a distribution that follows phylogenetic patterns rather than ecological adaptations. The 324 nm-MAA was also detected in two phylogenetically related species from freshwater as well as from subaerial habitats, Watanabea reniformis Hanagata et al. and isolate UR7/5, which were phylogenetically independent of Prasiola and its closer allies. MAAs were absent in another Trebouxiophyceae clade comprising lichen photobionts (Coccomyxa pringsheimii Jaag) as well as freshwater picoplanktonic algae (Choricystis minor (Skuja) Fott). The data presented suggest a chemotaxonomic value of the 324 nm-MAA in green algal taxonomy. To address the paraphyly of the genus Myrmecia Printz as presently circumscribed, we propose the new combination Lobosphaera incisa.

AB  - Biological invasions are now seen as one of the main threats to the Antarctic ecosystem. An example of such an invasion is the recent colonization of the H. Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station area by the non-native grass Poa annua. This site was previously occupied only by native plants like the Antarctic hair grass Deschampsia antarctica. To adapt successfully to new conditions, plants interact with soil microorganisms, including fungi. The aim of this study was to determine how the newly introduced grass P. annua established an interaction with fungi compared to resident grass D. antarctica. We found that fungal diversity in D. antarctica roots was significantly higher compared with P. annua roots. D. antarctica managed a biodiverse microbiome because of its ability to recruit fungal biocontrol agents from the soil, thus maintaining a beneficial nature of the endophyte community. P. annua relied on a set of specific fungal taxa, which likely modulated its cold response, increasing its competitiveness in Antarctic conditions. Cultivated endophytic fungi displayed strong chitinolysis, pointing towards their role as phytopathogenic fungi, nematode, and insect antagonists. This is the first study to compare the root mycobiomes of both grass species by direct culture-independent techniques as well as culture-based methods.

AB  - Antarctica includes different pristine environments dominated by extremophile microbial communities. Despite the ecological role importance of Antarctic microorganisms, some of them can represent interesting sources of bioproducts with potential industrial application. In the present study, we analysed the agarolytic and carrageenolytic activities of algicolous fungi from seven different macroalgal species of maritime Antarctica. After a selective isolation process, 44 fungal isolates were recovered and identified by biology molecular methods as belonging to the genera Antarctomyces, Beauveria, Cladosporium, Coprinellus, Doratomyces, Leucosporidiella, Metschnikowia, Penicillium, and Pseudogymnoascus. Rhodophyta macroalgae sheltered the fungi with the best potential for agarolytic and carrageenolytic activities. Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium sp., and Cladosporium sp. 2 simultaneously displayed the best carrageenolytic and agarolytic activities. Our results indicated that the Antarctic macroalgae shelter saprobe fungi that produce enzymes with the potential to degrade algal biomass and might release essential nutrients into the Antarctic Ocean. These agarolytic and/or carrageenolytic Antarctic fungi may also be useful in further industrial processes involving the biological extraction of agar and carrageenan, or their byproducts, to be used as substrates of third-generation bioethanol.

AB  - Spore-forming bacteria are known to produce various enzymes and bioproducts valuable to different industries and to bear the harsh conditions found in the Antarctic environment. However, aerobic or facultative spore-forming bacterial communities found in maritime Antarctic soils yet remain poorly studied. In this study, 80 spore-forming and cold-adapted bacterial strains were isolated from nine different soil samples of King George Island, in maritime Antarctica, and further clustered into amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis groups within each soil. Representative strains were then identified as belonging to Bacillus, Rummeliibacillus, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The ability to produce extracellular enzymes, antimicrobial substances and biosurfactants was determined in all isolates. The enzymatic activities most frequently found among the isolates were as follows: esterase (45 %), caseinase (30 %), amylase (16.2 %) and gelatinase (15 %). Biosurfactant production was detected in 25 % of the isolates. The growth inhibition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was observed in 13.7 % of the strains tested, but only two strains inhibited the growth of Candida albicans. The isolated spore-forming bacterial species were also compared with the characteristics of the different Antarctic soils sampled based on their physicochemical properties, showing that pH, C and P were the main factors correlated with the distribution of this group of bacteria in the Antarctic soils studied. These Antarctic endospore-forming bacterial strains may have a potential for industrial processes occurring at low temperatures.

AB  - The distribution of microorganisms in four soil samples taken near Casey Station, Wilkes Land, and on Dewart Island, Frazier Islands (East Antarctica), was studied using isolation cultures at different temperatures. The fungal assemblages comprised Penicillium, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Phoma, Verticillium, Phialophora, Candida and Rhodotorula. Microalgal Chlorophyta were also common. Among the bacteria representatives of cyanobacteria, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Pantoea, Streptomyces, Micromonospora, and coryne- and nocardioform species were found. Some of the isolated actinomycete strains, determined as Arthrobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and Micromonospora, produced extracellular substances with antibacterial and antifungal activities. Their potential as biological agents against phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi is discussed.

AB  - Recently, the study of the interactions within a microcosm between hosts and their associated microbial communities drew an unprecedented interest arising from the holobiont concept. Lichens, a symbiotic association between a fungus and an alga, are redefined as complex ecosystems considering the tremendous array of associated microorganisms that satisfy this concept. The present study focuses on the diversity of the microbiota associated with the seashore located lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum, recovered by different culture-dependent methods. Samples harvested from two sites allowed the isolation and the molecular identification of 68 fungal isolates distributed in 43 phylogenetic groups, 15 bacterial isolates distributed in five taxonomic groups and three microalgae belonging to two species. Moreover, for 12 fungal isolates belonging to 10 different taxa, the genus was not described in GenBank. These fungal species have never been sequenced or described and therefore non-studied. All these findings highlight the novel and high diversity of the microflora associated with R. geographicum. While many species disappear every day, this work suggests that coastal and wild environments still contain an unrevealed variety to offer and that lichens constitute a great reservoir of new microbial taxa which can be recovered by multiplying the culture-dependent techniques.

AB  - This work describes the distribution and diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of Colobanthus quitensis, a dicotyledonous plant that lives in Antarctica. A total of 188 fungal isolates were obtained from six different sites located across a 25.5-km transect through Admiralty Bay, at King George Island. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene was sequenced and the endophytic fungi were identified as species belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Cadophora, Davidiella, Entrophospora, Fusarium, Geomyces, Gyoerffyella, Microdochium, Mycocentrospora, and Phaeosphaeria. Davidiella tassiana was the prevalent species with 20.2% abundance. The endophytic fungal community showed low richness and high dominance indexes. Eleven endophytic taxa (58%) were fungi able to produce melanin in their hyphae, which may confer resistance against freezing temperatures and high rates of UV radiation and may increase their fitness in the extreme conditions of the Antarctic environment. In addition, phytopathogenic and decomposer species associated with healthy leaves of C. quitensis were found. The results obtained in this work show that C. quitensis is an interesting reservoir of saprobic and pathogenic fungal species, and could be a community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies, as well as studies of the adaptation mechanisms these microorganisms have to the extreme conditions in Antarctica.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a comparative screening between the nematophagous Antarctic fungus Arthrobotrys tortor and other species of that genus for the production of extracellular collagenases. The nematode species used in this study was Caenorhabditis elegans, feeding on Escherichia coli cultures. Determination of collagenase activity was made using insoluble collagen from bovine Achilles tendon and determining the amount of solubilized hydroxyproline produced. The results show that the total amount of collagenase produced by the Antarctic strain of A. tortor was about threefold higher than that observed for the other species. In the Antarctic strain, collagenase was shown to be a constitutive enzyme.

AB  - Nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15) in plants and soil are widely known as indicators of the N cycle in terrestrial ecosystem. Recent studies have proposed that the difference between plant and soil delta N-15 (Delta delta N-15) is a better indicator of the N cycle than plant delta N-15 or soil delta N-15 alone. However, the processes of the N cycle indicated by Delta delta N-15 are not well understood. The present study compared Delta delta N-15 variations between different ecosystems of northern Mongolia and northern Japan (Hokkaido) to associate the Delta delta N-15 characteristics with soil N availability. Needles of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) in Mongolia, Todo-fir (Abies sachalinensis (F. Schmidt) Mast.) in Hokkaido, and mineral soils from both regions were acquired for determination of Delta delta N-15 values. Delta delta N-15 showed similar large variations (8%) in the two regions with no significant correlations to climate factors. On the other hand, the relationship between Delta delta N-15 and soil delta N-15 was opposite between the two regions with a positive correlation in Mongolia (r(s) = 0.504) and a negative correlation in Hokkaido (r(s) = -0.600). Moreover, total inorganic N (total amount of NH4+ and NO3-) contents were up to 20 times higher in Hokkaido than in Mongolia. Delta delta N-15 showed significant correlation with the fraction of NO3- relative to total inorganic N in the 0-10 cm soil layer in Hokkaido. These results indicate that Delta delta N-15 variation in Hokkaido can be explained by progression of nitrification in soil, which is different in Mongolia where Delta delta N-15 variation is explained by microbial N immobilization. Our findings suggest that soil N availability affects Delta delta N-15 indicator owing to changes in the N cycle process, which are reflected in the relationships of foliage delta N-15 or soil delta N-15 with Delta delta N-15.

AB  - The terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica is restricted to small, very isolated, ice-free areas on the continent and on the islands adjacent to the Peninsula region. Lichens, a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, form the most prominent component in the vegetation. They have the greatest number of species compared with other cryptogamic and unicellular organisms. They are able to colonize all types of solid substrata and have a low mineral nutrient demand. Their physiological vigour is derived from high freezing tolerance and the ability to be photosynthetically activated by water vapour uptake from snow at temperatures as low as c. -20 degrees C. Long-term monitoring in their natural habitats demonstrates that lichens are photosynthetically active at suboptimal temperatures. Locally, however, they can benefit from meltwater on insolated rocks, but only for short periods in early summer. Although at this time they may be exposed to substrate temperatures of > 20 degrees C and strong light they do not suffer from photostress. If, in winter, lichens are covered and kept dark by snow with temperatures close to 0 degrees C, lichens enter a negative carbon balance. This effect may be relevant to lichens under conditions of global or regional warming.

AB  - In this study, biocatalysts in the form of mycelium-bound lipases of psychrotrophic and mesophilic fungi were screened for their ability to synthesize fatty acid methyl (FAME) and ethyl esters (FAEE). It has been shown that the hydrolytic activity of biocatalysts is not accompanied by their biodiesel synthetic activity. Preliminary studies showed for the first time, that the FTIR technique can be used to predict synthetic activity. The highest correlation between the intensity of the bands and synthetic activity, negative and positive, respectively, was observed for two neighboring bands at 1745 cm(-1) (R = -0.73) and 1699 cm(-1) (R = 0.68). The psychrotrophic strain Penicillium sp. 59, isolated from the soil of the Arctic tundra (Spitsbergen), has been shown for the first time as an efficient whole-cell biocatalyst for fatty acid ethyl ester synthesis and is stable in organic solvents. Mathematical optimization of biosynthesis was also performed using RSM. A molar canola oil conversion value of 83.3% into FAEE was obtained at 24.2 degrees C in n-hexane using 7.6% of used canola oil and 5.3% of the fungal biocatalyst within 6 h. Dry mycelium of Penicillium sp. 59 is a promising new biocatalyst for large-scale biosynthesis of biodiesel, given its low-cost production, high activity at room temperature, no need to mix reactions, and reusability in a minimum of six cycles.

AB  - Filamentous fungi and yeasts associated with the marine algae Adenocystis utricularis, Desmarestia anceps, and Palmaria decipiens from Antarctica were studied. A total of 75 fungal isolates, represented by 27 filamentous fungi and 48 yeasts, were isolated from the three algal species and identified by morphological, physiological, and sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region and D1/D2 variable domains of the large-subunit rRNA gene. The filamentous fungi and yeasts obtained were identified as belonging to the genera Geomyces, Antarctomyces, Oidiodendron, Penicillium, Phaeosphaeria, Aureobasidium, Cryptococcus, Leucosporidium, Metschnikowia, and Rhodotorula. The prevalent species were the filamentous fungus Geomyces pannorum and the yeast Metschnikowia australis. Two fungal species isolated in our study, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and M. australis, are endemic to Antarctica. This work is the first study of fungi associated with Antarctic marine macroalgae, and contributes to the taxonomy and ecology of the marine fungi living in polar environments. These fungal species may have an important role in the ecosystem and in organic matter recycling.

AB  - Different organic compounds have distinct residence times in soil and are degraded by specific taxa of saprotrophic fungi. It hence follows that specific fungal taxa should respire carbon of different ages from these compounds to the atmosphere. Here, we test whether this is the case by radiocarbon (C-14) dating CO2 evolved from two gamma radiation-sterilised maritime Antarctic soils inoculated with pure single cultures of four fungi. We show that a member of the Helotiales, which accounted for 41-56% of all fungal sequences in the two soils, respired soil carbon that was aged up to 1,200 years BP and which was 350-400 years older than that respired by the other three taxa. Analyses of the enzyme profile of the Helotialean fungus and the fluxes and delta C-13 values of CO2 that it evolved suggested that its release of old carbon from soil was associated with efficient cellulose decomposition. Our findings support suggestions that increases in the ages of carbon respired from warmed soils may be caused by changes to the abundances or activities of discrete taxa of microbes, and indicate that the loss of old carbon from soils is driven by specific fungal taxa.

AB  - Despite advances owing to molecular approaches, several hurdles still obstruct the identification of fungi forming orchid mycorrhizas. The Tulasnellaceae exhibit accelerated evolution of the nuclear ribosomal operon, causing most standard primers to fail in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) trials. Insufficient sequences are available from well characterized isolates and fruitbodies. Lastly, taxon-specific PCR primers are needed in order to explore the ecology of the fungi outside of the orchid root. Here, progress in overcoming these hurdles is reported.
   Broad-spectrum basidiomycete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers that do not exclude most known Tulasnellaceae are presented. BLAST searches and empirical PCR tests support their wide utility within the Basidiomycota.
   Taxon-specific ITS primers are presented targeted to orchid-associated Tulasnella, and a core component of the Thelephora-Tomentella complex. The efficiency and selectivity of these primer sets are again supported by BLAST searches and empirical tests.
   Lastly, ITS DNA sequences are presented from several strains of Epulorhiza, Ceratorhiza, Ceratobasidium, Sistotrema, Thanatephorus and Tulasnella that were originally described in the landmark mycorrhizal studies of Currah and Warcup. Detailed phylogenetic analyses reveal some inconsistencies in species concepts in these taxonomically challenging resupinate basidiomycetes, but also help to place several sequences from environmental samples.

AB  - Dispersal is a critical yet poorly understood factor underlying macroecological patterns in microbial communities(1). Airborne microbial transport is assumed to occupy a central role in determining dispersal outcomes(2,3), and extra-range dispersal has important implications for predicting ecosystem resilience and response to environmental changes. One of the most pertinent biomes in this regard is Antarctica, given its geographic isolation and vulnerability to climate change and human disturbances. Here, we report microbial diversity in near-ground and high-altitude air above the largest ice-free Antarctic habitat, as well as that of underlying soil microbial communities. We found that persistent local airborne inputs were unable to fully explain Antarctic soil community assembly. Comparison with airborne microbial diversity from high-altitude and non-polar sources suggests that strong selection occurs during long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of selection during airborne transit and at sink locations varied between microbial phyla. Overall, the communities from this isolated Antarctic ecosystem displayed limited connectivity to the non-polar microbial pool, and alternative sources of recruitment are necessary to fully explain extant soil diversity. Our findings provide critical insights into the role of airborne transport limitation in determining microbial biogeographic patterns.

AB  - Fungal biotransformation is an attractive synthetic strategy to produce highly specific compounds with chemical functionality in regions of the carbon skeleton that are not easily activated by conventional organic chemistry methods. In this work, Cladosporium antarcticum isolated from sediments of Glacier Collins in Antarctica was used to obtain novel drimane sesquiterpenoids alcohols with activity against Candida yeast from drimendiol and epidrimendiol. These compounds were produced by the high-yield reduction of polygodial and isotadeonal with NaBH4 in methanol. Cladosporium antarcticum produced two major products from drimendiol, identified as 9 alpha-hydroxydrimendiol (1, 41.4 mg, 19.4% yield) and 3 beta-hydroxydrimendiol (2, 74.8 mg, 35% yield), whereas the biotransformation of epidrimendiol yielded only one product, 9 beta-hydroxyepidrimendiol (3, 86.6 mg, 41.6% yield). The products were purified by column chromatography and their structure elucidated by NMR and MS. The antifungal activity of compounds 1-3 was analyzed against Candida albicans, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, showing that compound 2 has a MIC lower than 15 mu g/mL against the three-pathogenic yeast. In silico studies suggest that a possible mechanism of action for the novel compounds is the inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase, affecting the ergosterol synthesis.

AB  - We review the lithic microbial ecosystems of the McMurdo Dry Valleys as the main form of terrestrial colonization in this region, and assess the role of environmental controls such as temperature, solar radiation, water availability, wind, nutrient availability, salinity and the physicochemical properties of the colonized rock. Epilithic communities, especially those dominated by lichens, are able to withstand extreme environmental conditions but subsurface endolithic microhabitats provide more tolerant conditions. Endolithic microbial communities can be grouped into two main classes: eukaryotic communities (dominated by lichenized fungi and algae) and prokaryotic communities (dominated by cyanobacteria). Heterotrophic bacteria and non-lichenized algae and fungi (mainly black fungi) are also components of these communities. These lithobiontic microorganisms generally have effective mechanisms against freezing temperatures and desiccation. Extracellular polymeric substances play an important role not only in protecting microbial cells but also in community organization and in mitigating microenvironmental conditions. Antarctic lithobiontic communities are comprised of microbial consortia within which multiple interactions between the different biological and abiotic components are essential for microbial survival, whilst fossils and biomarkers provide evidence of earlier successful microbial life in Antarctic deserts. Finally, the uniqueness of the present lithobiont assemblages suggests they are the outcome of geographical isolation during the evolution of the continent and not merely the descendants of a subset of globally distributed taxa that have adapted to the extreme environmental conditions.

AB  - The yeast Pseudozyma antarctica secretes a concentrated biodegradable plastic (BP)-degrading enzyme when cultivated with xylose. Treatment with the culture filtrate reduced the puncture strength of commercial BP mulch films. After burying the film in soil, the residual amount of solid film was reduced significantly, and none was recovered after 5 weeks. The dynamics of soil fungal communities were analyzed weekly after burying the film using 18S rDNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) profiling of soil DNA. In the soil containing enzyme-treated film, the native community essentially recovered within 24 weeks. In comparison, the untreated solid film remained in the soil for 12 weeks and the response of the soil-fungal community was relatively slow; it had not recovered within 24 weeks.

AB  - Reduced to near extinction in the late 1800s, a number of wood bison populations (Bison bison athabascae) have been re-established through reintroduction initiatives. Although an invaluable tool for conservation, translocation of animals can spread infectious agents to new areas or expose animals to pathogens in their new environment. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, a bacterium that causes chronic enteritis in ruminants, is among the pathogens of potential concern for wood bison management and conservation. In order to inform translocation decisions, our objectives were to determine the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection status of wood bison herds in Canada and to culture and genetically characterize the infective strain(s). We tested fecal samples from bison (n = 267) in nine herds using direct PCR for three M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific genetic targets with different copy numbers within the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genome. Restriction enzyme analysis (REA) and sequencing of IS1311 were performed on seven samples from five different herds. We also evaluated a panel of different culture conditions for their ability to support M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis growth from feces and tissues of direct-PCR-positive animals. Eighty-one fecal samples (30%) tested positive using direct IS900 PCR, with positive samples from all nine herds; of these, 75% and 21% were also positive using ISMAP02 and F57, respectively. None of the culture conditions supported the growth of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis from PCR-positive samples. IS1311 REA and sequencing indicate that at least two different M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strain types exist in Canadian wood bison. The presence of different M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains among wood bison herds should be considered in the planning of translocations.

AB  - Soil microbes produce an immense diversity of metabolites, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can shape the structure and function of microbial communities. VOCs mediate a multitude of microbe-microbe interactions, including antagonism. Despite their importance, the diversity and functional relevance of most microbial volatiles remain uncharacterized. We assembled a taxonomically diverse collection of 48 Actinobacteria isolated from soil and airborne dust and surveyed the VOCs produced by these strains on two different medium types in vitro using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We detected 126 distinct VOCs and structurally identified approximately 20% of these compounds, which were predominately C-1 to C-5 hetero-VOCs, including (oxygenated) alcohols, ketones, esters, and nitrogen-and sulfur-containing compounds. Each strain produced a unique VOC profile. While the most common VOCs were likely by-products of primary metabolism, most of the VOCs were strain specific. We observed a strong taxonomic and phylogenetic signal for VOC profiles, suggesting their role in finer-scale patterns of ecological diversity. Finally, we investigated the functional potential of these VOCs by assessing their effects on growth rates of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic pseudomonad strains. We identified sets of VOCs that correlated with growth inhibition and stimulation, information that may facilitate the development of microbial VOC-based pathogen control strategies.
   IMPORTANCE Soil microbes produce a diverse array of natural products, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Volatile compounds are important molecules in soil habitats, where they mediate interactions between bacteria, fungi, insects, plants, and animals. We measured the VOCs produced by a broad diversity of soil- and dust-dwelling Actinobacteria in vitro. We detected a total of 126 unique volatile compounds, and each strain produced a unique combination of VOCs. While some of the compounds were produced by many strains, most were strain specific. Importantly, VOC profiles were more similar between closely related strains, indicating that evolutionary and ecological processes generate predictable patterns of VOC production. Finally, we observed that actinobacterial VOCs had both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria that represent a plant-beneficial symbiont and a plant-pathogenic strain, information that may lead to the development of novel strategies for plant disease prevention.

AB  - The Antarctic continent is characterized by extreme conditions and encompasses peculiar environments which represent promising habitats for the recovery of well-adapted microorganisms with unique metabolic capabilities. Enzymatic activity combined to salinity and pH tolerance of bacteria that thrive in low temperature environment have attracted attention of researchers in recent years and, as scarce information on that topic is available, the aim of this study was to prospect bacteria isolated from Antarctic samples for extracellular amylase activity and to determine their salinity and pH tolerances. Ninety-one bacteria isolated from Antarctic environmental samples, including marine sponges and invertebrates, sediments and soil biofilm, were screened. Fourty-two isolates were selected as putative amylase producers based on their ability to produce clearing zones in agar plates. Eighty-six and forty-four isolates were able to grow at 5 and 10% NaCl concentrations, respectively. The best enzymatic activities for isolates 226 and 227 were 768.5 U dL 1 (20 degrees C) and 1410,16 U dL 1 (20 degrees C), respectively, both influenced by the temperature. All variables assayed showed statistically significant differences for isolates 227 and 226, demonstrating that enzyme activities respond differently to the applied conditions. This is the first report that describes the amylase activity from Carnobacterium and Psychrobacter strains isolated from Antarctic samples. These results encourage subsequent investigations of enzymes produced by microorganisms adapted to low temperatures and high osmolarity conditions, aiming future biotechnological application in pharmaceutical, textile or food industries.

AB  - Global warming will have far-reaching effects on our ecosystem. However, its effects on Antarctic soils have been poorly explored. To assess the effects of warming on microbial abundance and community composition, we sampled Antarctic soils from the King George Island in the Antarctic Peninsula and incubated these soils at elevated temperatures of 5 degrees C and 8 degrees C for 14 days. The reduction in total organic carbon and increase in soil respiration were attributed to the increased proliferation of Bacteria, Fungi, and Archaea. Interestingly, bacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes were predominant over archaeal amoA, unlike in many other environments reported previously. Phylogenetic analyses of bacterial and archaeal amoA communities via clone libraries revealed that the diversity of amoA genes in Antarctic ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotic communities were temperature-insensitive. Interestingly, our data also showed that the amoA of Antarctic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities differed from previously described amoA sequences of cultured isolates and clone library sequences, suggesting the presence of novel Antarctic-specific AOB communities. Denitrification-related genes were significantly reduced under warming conditions, whereas the abundance of amoA and nifH increased. Barcoded pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the major phyla in Antarctic soils and the effect of short-term warming on the bacterial community was not apparent.

AB  - The Antarctic black meristematic fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 occurs endolithically in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, one of the best analogue for Mars environment on Earth. To date, this fungus is considered one of the best eukaryotic models for astrobiological studies and has been repeatedly selected for space experiments in the last decade. The obtained results are reviewed here, with special focus on responses to space relevant irradiation, UV radiation, and both sparsely and densely ionizing radiation, which represent the major injuries for a putative space-traveller. The remarkable resistance of this model organism to space stress, its radioresistance in particular, and mechanisms involved, significantly contributed to expanding our concept of limits for life and provided new insights on the origin and evolution of life in planetary systems, habitability, and biosignatures for life detection as well as on human protection during space missions.

AB  - Fermentation of the marine-derived fungus Trichoderma asperellum, collected from the sediment of the Antarctic Penguin Island, resulted in the isolation of six new peptaibols named asperelines A-F (1-6), which are characterized by an acetylated N-terminus and a C-terminus containing an uncommon prolinol residue. Structures were determined by extensive 1D and 2D NMR (H-1-H-1 COSY, HMQC, HMBC, NOESY) spectroscopic data analysis combined with ESIMS/MS fragmentation. The absolute configurations of the amino acid residues possessing a chiral alpha-carbon and of the prolinol residue were determined to be L and S, respectively, using a new method of H-1 NMR spectroscopic comparison of complexes formed between the chiral reagent Ru(D-4-Por*)CO and amino acids derived from the peptaibols with those formed with reference standards.

AB  - Browning Peninsula is an ice-free polar desert situated in the Windmill Islands, Eastern Antarctica. The entire site is described as a barren landscape, comprised of frost boils with soils dominated by microbial life. In this study, we explored the microbial diversity and edaphic drivers of community structure across this site using traditional cultivation methods, a novel approach the soil substrate membrane system (SSMS), and culture-independent 454-tag pyrosequencing. The measured soil environmental and microphysical factors of chlorine, phosphate, aspect and elevation were found to be significant drivers of the bacterial community, while none of the soil parameters analyzed were significantly correlated to the fungal community. Overall, Browning Peninsula soil harbored a distinctive microbial community in comparison to other Antarctic soils comprised of a unique bacterial diversity and extremely limited fungal diversity. Tag pyrosequencing data revealed the bacterial community to be dominated by Actinobacteria (36%), followed by Chloroflexi (18%), Cyanobacteria (14%), and Proteobacteria (10%). For fungi, Ascomycota (97%) dominated the soil microbiome, followed by Basidiomycota. As expected the diversity recovered from culture-based techniques was lower than that detected using tag sequencing. However, in the SSMS enrichments, that mimic the natural conditions for cultivating oligophilic "k-selected" bacteria, a larger proportion of rare bacterial taxa (15%), such as Blastococcus, Devosia, Herbaspirillum, Propionibacterium and Methylocella and fungal (11%) taxa, such as Nigrospora, Exophiala, Hortaea, and Penidiella were recovered at the genus level. At phylum level, a comparison of OTU's showed that the SSMS shared 21% of Acidobacteria, 11% of Actinobacteria and 10% of Proteobacteria OTU's with soil. For fungi, the shared OTUs was 4% ( Basidiomycota) and <0.5%( Ascomycota). This was the first known attempt to culture microfungi using the SSMS which resulted in an increase in diversity from 14 to 57 microfungi OTUs compared to standard cultivation. Furthermore, the SSMS offers the opportunity to retrieve a greater diversity of bacterial and fungal taxa for future exploitation.

AB  - Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities are self-supporting borderline ecosystems spreading across the extreme conditions of the Antarctic desert and represent the predominant life-form in the ice-free areas of McMurdo Dry Valleys, accounted as the closest terrestrial Martian analogue. Components of these communities are highly adapted extremophiles and extreme-tolerant microorganisms, among the most resistant known to date. Recently, studies investigated biodiversity and community composition in these ecosystems but the metabolic activity of the metacommunity has never been investigated. Using an untargeted metabolomics, we explored stress-response of communities spreading in two sites of the same location, subjected to increasing environmental pressure due to opposite sun exposure, accounted as main factor influencing the diversity and composition of these ecosystems. Overall, 331 altered metabolites (206 and 125 unique for north and south, respectively), distinguished the two differently exposed communities. We also selected 10 metabolites and performed two-stage Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to test them as potential biomarkers. We further focused on melanin and allantoin as protective substances; their concentration was highly different in the community in the shadow or in the sun. These results clearly indicate that opposite insolation selected organisms in the communities with different adaptation strategies in terms of key metabolites produced.

AB  - Melanin is a ubiquitous pigment with unique physicochemical properties. The resistance of melanized fungi to cosmic and terrestrial ionizing radiation suggests that melanin also plays a pivotal role in radioprotection. In this study, we compared the effects of densely-ionizing deuterons and sparsely-ionizing X-rays on two microscopic fungi capable of melanogenesis. We utilized the fast-growing pathogenic basiodiomycete forming an induced DOPA-melanin, Cryptococcus neoformans (CN); and the slow-growing environmental rock-inhabiting ascomycete synthesizing a constitutive DHN-melanin, Cryomyces antarcticus (CA); melanized and non-melanized counterparts were compared. CA was more resistant to deuterons than CN, and similar resistance was observed for X-rays. Melanin afforded protection against high-dose (1.5 kGy) deuterons for both CN and CA (p-values<10(-4)). For X-rays (0.3 kGy), melanin protected CA (p-values<10(-4)) and probably CN. Deuterons increased XTT activity in melanized strains of both species, while the activity in non-melanized cells remained stable or decreased. For ATP levels the reverse occurred: it decreased in melanized strains, but not in non-melanized ones, after deuteron exposure. For both XTT and ATP, which reflect the metabolic activity of the cells, larger and more statistically-significant differences as a function of melanization status occurred in CN. Our data show, for the first time, that melanin protected both fast-growing and slow-growing fungi from high doses of deuterons under physiological conditions. These observations may give clues for creating melanin-based radioprotectors.

AB  - The Antarctic continent is one of the most inhospitable places on earth, where living creatures, mostly represented by microorganisms, have specific physiological characteristics that allow them to adapt to the extreme environmental conditions. These physiological adaptations can result in the production of unique secondary metabolites with potential biotechnological applications. The current study presents a genetic and antibacterial characterization of four Antarctic fungi isolated from soil samples collected in Pedro Vicente Maldonado Scientific Station, at Fort William Point, Greenwich Island, Antarctica. Based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the fungi were identified as Antarctomyces sp., Thelebolus sp., Penicillium sp., and Cryptococcus gilvescens. The antibacterial activity was assessed against four clinical bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, by a modified bacterial growth inhibition assay on agar plates. Results showed that C. gilvescens and Penicillium sp. have potential antibiotic activity against all bacterial strains. Interestingly, Thelebolus sp. showed potential antibiotic activity only against E. coli. In contrast, Antarctomyces sp. did not show antibiotic activity against any of the bacteria tested under our experimental conditions. This study highlights the importance of conservation of Antarctica as a source of metabolites with important biomedical applications.

AB  - Antarctica is one of the most stressful environments for plant life and the Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) is adapted to the hostile conditions. Plant-associated microorganisms can contribute to plant survival in cold environments, but scarce information is available on the taxonomic structure and functional roles of C. quitensis-associated microbial communities. This study aimed at evaluating the possible impacts of climate warming on the taxonomic structure of C. quitensis endophytes and at investigating the contribution of culturable bacterial endophytes to plant growth at low temperatures. The culture-independent analysis revealed changes in the taxonomic structure of bacterial and fungal communities according to plant growth conditions, such as the collection site and the presence of open-top chambers (OTCs), which can simulate global warming. Plants grown inside OTCs showed lower microbial richness and higher relative abundances of biomarker bacterial genera (Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Aeromicrobium, Aureimonas, Hymenobacter, Novosphingobium, Pedobacter, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas) and fungal genera (Alternaria, Cistella, and Vishniacozyma) compared to plants collected from open areas (OA), as a possible response to global warming simulated by OTCs. Culturable psychrotolerant bacteria of C. quitensis were able to endophytically colonize tomato seedlings and promote shoot growth at low temperatures, suggesting their potential contribution to plant tolerance to cold conditions.

AB  - Our understanding of the diversity and community dynamics of soil fungi has increased greatly through the use of DNA-based identification. Community characterization of metabolically active communities via RNA sequencing has previously revealed differences between 'active' and 'total' fungal communities, which may be influenced by the persistence of DNA from nonactive components. However, it is not known how fungal traits influence their prevalence in these contrasting community profiles. In this study, we coextracted DNA and RNA from soil collected from three Antarctic islands to test for differences between total and active soil fungal communities. By matching these geographically isolated fungi against a global dataset of soil fungi, we show that widely dispersed taxa are often more abundant in the total community, whilst taxa restricted to Antarctica are more likely to have higher abundance in the active community. In addition, we find that active communities have lower richness, and show a reduction in the abundance of the most dominant fungi, whilst there are consistent differences in the abundances of certain taxonomic groups between the total and active communities. These results suggest that the views of soil fungal communities offered by DNA- and RNA-based characterization differ in predictable ways.

AB  - L-Asparaginase (L-asparagine aminohydrolase, E. C. 3.5.1.1) has been proven to be competent in treating Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL), which is widely observed in paediatric and adult groups. Currently, clinical L-Asparaginase formulations are derived from bacterial sources such as Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. These formulations when administered to ALL patients lead to several immunological and hypersensitive reactions. Hence, additional purification steps are required to remove toxicity induced by the amalgamation of other enzymes like glutaminase and urease. Production of L-Asparaginase that is free of glutaminase and urease is a major area of research. In this paper, we report the screening and isolation of fungal species collected from the soil and mosses in the Schirmacher Hills, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, that produce L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. A total of 55 isolates were obtained from 33 environmental samples that were tested by conventional plate techniques using Phenol red and Bromothymol blue as indicators. Among the isolated fungi, 30 isolates showed L-Asparaginase free of glutaminase and urease. The L-Asparaginase producing strain Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1, which showed the highest zone index, was then optimized with a Taguchi design. Optimum enzyme activity of 20.57 U mL(-1) was obtained at a temperature of 30 degrees C and pH of 7.0 after 60 hours. Our work suggests that isolation of fungi from extreme environments such as Antarctica may lead to an important advancement in therapeutic applications with fewer side effects.

AB  - During three austral summer seasons, dust and soil from clothes, boots and equipment of members of scientific expeditions and tourists visiting the Polish Antarctic Station Henryk Arctowski were collected and analysed for the presence of fungal propagules. Of a total of 60 samples, 554 colonies of fungi belonging to 19 genera were identified. Colonies of the genus Cladosporium, Penicillium and non-sporulating fungus (Mycelia sterilia) dominated in the examined samples. The microbiological assessment of air for the presence of fungi was also conducted at two points in the station building and two others outside the station. A total of 175 fungal colonies belonging to six genera were isolated. Colonies of the genus Penicillium were the commonest in the air samples. The potential epidemiological consequences for indigenous species as a result of unintentional transport of fungal propagules to the Antarctic biome are discussed in the light of rapid climate change in some parts of the Antarctic and adaptation of fungi to extreme conditions.

AB  - Although dark septate fungal endophytes (DSE) occur widely in association with plant roots in cold-stressed habitats, little is known of the taxonomic status of DSE in Antarctica. Here we investigate the phylogenetic affinities of DSE colonising the roots of Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, the two maritime Antarctic vascular plant species. Two hundred and forty-three DSE were isolated from roots collected from 17 sites across a 1470 km transect through maritime and sub-Antarctica. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene cluster of representative isolates was sequenced, and the sequences were recovered in 10 sequence groups and sub-groups. Nine of the sequence groupings could be placed in the Helotiales and the remaining one showed high homology to a large number of currently unassigned anamorphic ascomycete sequences. Of the Helotiales, Leptodontidium orchidicola, Rhizoscyphus ericae and species of Tapesia and Mollisia could be confidently identified. This study demonstrates that members of the Helotiales, including several widely-recognised DSE genera, commonly colonise the roots of C. quitensis and D. antarctica in the Antarctic.

AB  - Results of a study on the diffusion of keratinophilic fungi in an Antarctic environment are given. Nine soil samples collected from as many sites along the coast of Ross Sea, and six dust samples inside the Italian scientific base were examined by direct inoculation and hair baiting methods for soil samples and plate dilution method for dust samples. As regards the variety of species isolated and the counting of the numbers of colonies, plate dilution method proved to be very effective. Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium sp., Dematiaceae, Fusarium sp., Geomyces pannorum v. pannorum, G. pannorum v. vinaceus, Mycelia sterilia, Penicillium spp. were isolated from soil. From the dust the following moulds were isolated: Aphanoascus fulvescens, Aspergillus sp., Beauveria sp., Chrysosporium carmichaelii, Dematiaceae, Geomyces pannorum v. pannorum, G. pannorum v. vinaceus, Malbranchea gypsea, Mycelia sterilia, Nectria inventa, Penicillium spp., Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Scopulariopsis sp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The presence of four colonies of Trichophyton mentagrophytes is emphasized and correlated with the anthropization process.

AB  - Species with narrow niche breadths are assumed to be more susceptible to environmental changes than those with wide niche breadths. Although information on niche properties is necessary for predicting biological responses to environmental changes, such information is largely missing for soil microbes. In this study, we present the temperature niche positions and breadths of a functionally important group of eukaryotic soil microbes, ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. We compiled high-quality EM fungal sequence data from 26 forested sites in Japan (with mean annual temperatures ranging from 1.6 to 23.6 degrees C) to create temperature niche profiles for each individual fungal species. Nested theory and a newly developed weighted-randomization null model were applied to 75 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with high occurrence records to examine potential preferences for certain temperature positions and breadths. Our analyses revealed that (a) many EM fungal OTUs were restricted to habitats with low mean annual temperatures, (b) fungal OTUs observed at colder sites exhibited narrower temperature breadths than expected by chance, (c) the composition of EM fungal OTUs exhibited a nested pattern along the temperature gradient, and (d) EM fungal richness was highest at colder sites, where the greatest degree of overlap in OTU occurrence was observed. These findings imply that future warming may limit the distribution of many EM fungal species that are currently adapted to only cold climates. This could eventually reduce EM fungal biodiversity, which is linked to forest function through symbiotic associations with trees. This study demonstrates the distribution and environmental ranges of various EM fungal species and can contribute to develop species distribution models with the aim of conserving microbes in the face of climate change.

AB  - The ste1 gene encoding a steryl esterase was isolated from the thermophilic fungus Melanocarpus albomyces. The gene has one intron, and it encodes a protein consisting of 576 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the steryl esterase was shown to be related to lipases and other esterases such as carboxylesterases. Formation of mature protein requires post-translational removal of a putative 18-amino-acid signal sequence and a 13-residue propeptide at the N-terminus. The intronless version of the Melanocarpus albomyces ste1 gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris under the inducible AOX1 promoter. The production level was low, and a large proportion of the total activity yield was found to be present intracellularly. However, the fact that steryl esterase activity was produced by P. pastoris cells carrying the expression cassette confirmed that the correct gene had been cloned. The stet gene was subsequently expressed in T reesei under the inducible cbh1 promoter, and a clearly higher production level was obtained. About 60% of the total activity was bound to the fungal mycelium or to solid components of the culture medium, or existed as aggregates. Triton X-100 was successfully used to recover this activity. The heterologous production system in T. reesei provides a means of producing M. albomyces steryl esterase STE1 reliably in large scale for future studies. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A new fungal species, Penicillium psychrofluorescens sp. nov. is described as a member of section Torulomyces. The new species is sister to P. catalonicum, and was isolated from soil collected from Robinson Ridge, East Antarctica, following enrichment cultivation under oligotrophic conditions supplemented with excess hydrogen gas. Penicillium psychrofluorescens is named for its intense autofluorescence derived from a combination of compounds that may include NADPH, porphyrins, and secondary metabolites, such as polyketides. Comparative genomics with both Antarctic and mesophilic Penicillium spp. shows that Penicillium psychrofluorescens has a wide repertoire of glycoside hydrolases, but almost no polysaccharide lyases, has comparably large effector proteins, lacks the machinery to use nitrate as an N-source, but has the genes for the assimilation of phosphorus from phosphonates via oxidative pathway. The strain was found to have 30 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), the majority of which were unrelated to known compound BGCs. Given the remarkable diversity of natural products already characterised from Penicillium spp. and the presence of >30 BGCs with low similarity to known genes, there is biotechnological potential within this novel species that is yet to be explored.

AB  - Salinization of soils is one of the main sources of soil degradation worldwide, particularly in arid and semiarid ecosystems. High salinity results in osmotic stress and it can negatively impact plant grow and survival. Some plant species, however, can tolerate salinity by accumulating osmolytes like proline and maintaining low Na+ concentrations inside the cells. Another mechanism of saline stress tolerance is the association with symbiotic microorganism, an alternative that can be used as a biotechnological tool in susceptible crops. From the immense diversity of plant symbionts, those found in extreme environments such as Antarctica seems to be the ones with most potential since they (and their host) evolved in harsh and stressful conditions. We evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a consortium of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPB) and endosymbiotic fungi isolated from an Antarctic plant on saline stress tolerance in different crops. To test this we established 4 treatments: (i) uninoculated plants with no saline stress, (ii) uninoculated plants subjected to saline stress (200 mM NaCl), (iii) plants inoculated with the microorganism consortium with no saline stress, and (iv) inoculated plants subjected to saline stress. First, we assessed the effect of symbiont consortium on survival of four different crops (cayenne, lettuce, onion, and tomato) in order to obtain a more generalized response of this biological interaction. Second, in order to deeply the mechanisms involved in salt tolerance, in lettuce plants we measured the ecophysiological performance (F-v/F-m) and lipid peroxidation to estimate the impact of saline stress on plants. We also measured proline accumulation and NHX1 antiporter gene expression (involved in Na+ detoxification) to search for possible mechanism of stress tolerance. Additionally, root, shoot, and total biomass was also obtained as an indicator of productivity. Overall, plants inoculated with microorganisms from Antarctica increased the fitness related traits in several crops. In fact, three of four crops selected to assess the general response increased its survival under salt conditions compared with those uninoculated plants. On the other hand, saline stress negatively impacted all measured trait, but inoculated plants were significantly less affected. In control osmotic conditions, there were no differences in proline accumulation and lipid peroxidation between inoculation treatments. Interestingly, even in control salinity, F-v/F-m was higher in inoculated plants after 30 and 60 days. Under osmotic stress, F-v/F-m, proline accumulation and NHX1 expression was significantly higher and lipid peroxidation lower in inoculated plants compared to uninoculated individuals. Moreover, inoculated plants exposed to saline stress had a similar final biomass (whole plant) compared to individuals under no stress. We conclude that Antarctic extremophiles can effectively reduce the physiological impact of saline stress in a salt-susceptible crops and also highlight extreme environments such as Antarctica as a key source of microorganism with high biotechnological potential.

AB  - The search for traces of extinct or extant life in extraterrestrial environments is one of the main goals for astrobiologists; due to their ability to withstand stress producing conditions, extremophiles are perfect candidates for astrobiological studies. The BIOMEX project aims to test the ability of biomolecules and cell components to preserve their stability under space and Mars-like conditions, while at the same time investigating the survival capability of microorganisms. The experiment has been launched into space and is being exposed on the EXPOSE-R2 payload, outside of the International Space Station (ISS) over a time-span of 1.5 years. Along with a number of other extremophilic microorganisms, the Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 has been included in the experiment. Before launch, dried colonies grown on Lunar and Martian regolith analogues were exposed to vacuum, irradiation and temperature cycles in ground based experiments (EVT1 and EVT2). Cultural and molecular tests revealed that the fungus survived on rock analogues under space and simulated Martian conditions, showing only slight ultra-structural and molecular damage.

AB  - Despite over two centuries of fairly intensive study, the lichen flora of Central European countries is still incompletely known. Based on revision of herbarium material and new field work, we report thirty-four species from the Czech Republic for the first time, and twenty-two from Slovakia. Caloplaca brachyspora, Micarea confuse and Sclerophora amabilis are new to Central Europe. Caloplaca alaskensis is reported outside the Arctic for the first time. Other noteworthy records worth of mention are e.g. Arthonia incarnate, Bacidina etayana, Biatora pontica, Bryoria furcellata, Candelariella lutella, C. viae-lactae, Metamelanea caesiella, Peccania cernohorskyi, Rhizoplaca melanophthahna, Thelocarpon imperceptum,Verrucaria ulmi and Xanthoria papillifera. Eight species (mainly from lowland forests) have not been found over 70 or more years from the territory of the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Four species were reported in the past but were omitted from the current national checklists. Other species new to the explored countries are Bacidia pycnidiata, Bacidina brandii, B. saxenii, B. sulphurella, Buellia arborea, Caloplaca arcis, C. dichroa, C. tominii, C. xerica, Candelaria pacifica, Candelariella plumbea, Catillaria fungoides, Cladonia novochlorophaea, Collolechia caesia, Dendrographa decolorans, Fellhanera viridisorediata, Lecania sordida, Lecidea sphaerella, L. strasseri, Lecidella albida, Leptogium intermedium, Micarea globulosella, M nowakii, Normandina acroglypta, Peltigera extenuate, Reichlingia leopoldii, Rhizocarpon timdalii, Rhizoplaca subdiscrepans, Rinodina capensis, Schismatomma umbrinum, Sclerococcum griseisporodochium, Thelocarpon citrum, Verrucaria beltraminiana, V breussii, V fuscovelutina, V phloeophila, and Xylographa pallens. ITS rDNA was used to confirm the identity of Caloplaca alaskensis and C. arcis. The lichen diversity of Central European countries and their phytogeographical connections are briefly discussed.

AB  - Basal ice formation in the terrestrial snow cover is a common phenomenon in northern circumpolar areas, onehaving significant impacts on ecosystems, vegetation, animals and human activities. There is limited knowledge on the spatial and temporal occurrence of basal ice formation because of the sparse observation network and challenges involved in detecting formation events. We present a unique dataset on the annual extent of ice formation events in northern Finland between 1948 and 2016 based on reindeer herders' descriptions of the cold season in their management reports. In extreme years, basal ice can form over wide geographical extents. In approximately half of the herding districts studied, it occurred more frequently in the period 1983-2016 than in the period 1948-1982. Furthermore, five out of seven of the most extensive basal ice formation events (90th percentile) occurred between 1991 and 2016. Themost commonly reported processes related to ice formation were thaw or rain-on-snow events followed by freezing of the snow cover. Years with extensive basal ice formation were often characterized by above-average October-December air temperatures, air temperature variations around 0 degrees C and relatively high precipitation. However, basal ice did not occur during all warm and wet early winters, and formation events were generally weakly linked to the large-scale atmospheric teleconnections. Another risk factor for reindeer grazing associated with warm and rainy earlywinters is the growth of mycotoxin-producing molds below the snow. Approximately 24% of all reported mold formation events co-occurred with basal ice formation. The prevalence and frequency of basal ice formation events can be assessed based on our results. Ourwork contributes to understanding long-term fluctuations and changes in snow and ice conditions and the impacts of this variability in circumpolar areas.

AB  - Twenty-seven strains of basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia spp. were collected from lake sediment and soil surrounding the lakes in the Skarvsnes area, East Antarctica. Based on sequence similarity of their ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions and D1/D2 domains, the isolated strains were classified into three species; Mrakia blollopis (18 strains), M. gelida (7 strains), and M. robertii (2 strains). All of the strains produced ethanol from glucose at 10 degrees C. Six strains selected from the 27 isolates were then tested for ethanol fermentation and ethanol tolerance at 100 g/l glucose. Mrakia blollopis SK-4 and M. blollopis NRI-4 completely consumed the glucose within 13 d and 6 d of fermentation respectively, and demonstrated high ethanol yields and ethanol tolerance. In contrast, M. blollopis AGK-3 and M. blollopis TKG1-2 exhibited low ethanol yields and poor ethanol tolerance. These results indicate that ethanol yields of different Mrakia species may depend on ethanol tolerance in individual strains. (C) 2015 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the extensive use of plastics, their quantity in the environment is constantly increasing, which creates a global problem. In the present study, we sought to isolate, test and identify Antarctic microorganisms which possess the ability to biodegrade bioplastics such as poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) and poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA) at low temperatures. 161 bacterial and 38 fungal isolates were isolated from 22 Antarctic soil samples. Among them, 92.16% of bacterial and 77.27% of fungal isolates formed a clear zone on emulsified PBSA, 98.04% and 81.82% on PBS and 100% and 77.27% on PCL as an additive to minimal medium at 20 degrees C.
   Based on the 16S and 18S rRNA sequences, bacterial strains were identified as species belonging to Pseudomonas and Bacillus and fungal strains as species belonging to Geomyces, Sclerotinia, Fusarium and Mortierella, while the yeast strain was identified as Hansenula anomala. In the biodegradation process conducted under laboratory conditions at 14, 20 and 28 degrees C, Sclerotinia sp. B11IV and Fusarium sp. B30M strains showed the highest biodegradation activity at 20 degrees C (49.68% for PBSA and 33.7% for PCL, 45.99% for PBSA and 49.65% for PCL, respectively). The highest biodegradation rate for Geomyces sp. B10I was noted at 14 degrees C (25.67% for PBSA and 5.71% for PCL), which suggested a preference for lower temperatures (at 20 degrees C the biodegradation rate was only 11.34% for PBSA, and 4.46% for PCL). These data showed that microorganisms isolated from Antarctic regions are good candidates for effective plastic degradation at low temperatures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The search for life beyond Earth currently hinges on the detection of biosignatures that are indicative of current or past life, with terrestrial life being the sole known example. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which acts as the long-term storage of genetic information in all known organisms, is considered a biosignature of life. Techniques like the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) are particularly useful as they allow for the amplification of DNA fragments, allowing the detection of even trace amounts of genetic material. This study aimed to detect DNA extracted from colonies of an Antarctic black fungus both when (i) alone and (ii) mixed with a Sulfatic Mars Regolith Simulant (S-MRS), after exposure to increasing doses of Fe ions (up to 1 kGy). PCR-based amplification methods were used for detection. The findings of this study revealed no DNA amplification in samples mixed with Sulfatic Mars Regolith Simulant, providing important insights into the potential application of these techniques for in situ DNA detection during future space exploration missions or for their application on the Mars sample return program; it also gives input in the planetary protection discussions.

AB  - Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems are largely dominated by lichens, while shallow coastal environments are mainly covered by macroalgae. The aim of this study was to isolate and to evaluate the diversity of yeasts in different species of macroalgae and lichens collected in South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. A total of 405 yeasts were recovered (205 from macroalgae and 200 from lichens). The yeast community from macroalgae was most diversity than the yeast community from lichen. The dominance index was similar for both substrates. A total of 24 taxa from macroalgae and 18 from lichens were identified, and only 5 were common to both substrates. Metschnikowia australis, Mrakia sp., Rhodotorula glacialis and Glaciozyma litorale were the most abundant yeasts in macroalgae and Cryptococcus victoriae, Rhodotorula laryngis, Rhodotorula arctica, Trichosporon sp. 1 and Mrakia sp. were the most abundant in lichens. Based on molecular and phylogenetic analyses, four yeast from macroalgae and six from lichens were considered potential new species. This is the first study to report the yeast communities from the Antarctic macroalgae Himantothallus grandifolius and lichen Ramalina terebrata. Results suggest that Antarctic phyco and lichensphere represent a huge substrate for cold-adapted yeasts and enhanced the knowledge of the microbiota from extreme environments.

AB  - In the multifaceted soil habitat, predation is one of the most successful strategies for obtaining food. An example of prokaryotic predators is myxobacteria. Although the prey spectra of some myxobacteria have been the subject of numerous studies, these myxobacteria are usually rare in soils compared to other myxobacterial families. Consequently, predation assays featuring easily cultivable myxobacteria provide only limited information on the myxobacterial potential and their interactions with organisms in the soil. Therefore, the prey spectrum of representatives of more common families was tested and compared with members of the model family Myxococcaceae. In a newly developed assay, the extent of lysis was tested against various Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, as well as four yeasts. It was shown that Kofleria flava and Haliangium ochraceum have an equally diverse prey spectrum as the model genera Myxococcus and Corallococcus. However, less well-studied myxobacteria often lyse the prey colonies to a larger extent. Yeasts were lysed just as efficiently as bacteria. Furthermore, it was tested whether different myxobacteria can inhibit the growth of filamentous fungi. Almost every strain was able to prevent the spread of at least one fungus. H. ochraceum showed the highest activity and inhibited all fungi, including plant pathogenic Fusarium. These multiple interactions together with the high relative abundance in situ, suggest that myxobacteria, especially understudied families, could have a more important role in the soil food web than previously thought. The individual interaction spectra of the different myxobacteria provide only a glimpse at the complex relationships between the organisms in soil, which still remain understudied.

AB  - We assessed soil fungal diversity at two sites on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica using DNA metabarcoding analysis. The first site was a relatively undisturbed area, and the second was much more heavily impacted by research and tourism. We detected 346 fungal amplicon sequence variants dominated by the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota and Chytridiomycota. We also detected taxa belonging to the rare phyla Mucoromycota and Rozellomycota, which have been difficult to detect in Antarctica by traditional isolation methods. Cladosporium sp., Pseudogymnoascus roseus, Leotiomycetes sp. 2, Penicillium sp., Mortierella sp. 1, Mortierella sp. 2, Pseudogymnoascus appendiculatus and Pseudogymnoascus sp. were the most dominant fungi. In addition, 440,153 of the total of 1,214,875 reads detected could be classified only at the level of Fungi. In both sampling areas the DNA of opportunistic, phytopathogenic and symbiotic fungi were detected, which might have been introduced by human activities, transported by birds or wind, and/or represent resident fungi not previously reported from Antarctica. Further long-term studies are required to elucidate how biological colonization in the island may be affected by climatic changes and/or other anthropogenic influences.

AB  - Diversity of microorganisms plays an important role in the functioning of ecosystems and their response to large-scale environmental changes. Microbial soil communities from virgin Haswell Island, Antarctica, were studied using the serial dilution-spread plate method at two different temperatures. Microorganisms were identified by sporulation, morphological, chemotaxonomic assessment. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and microalgae prevailed in the samples. Representatives of Chamaesiphon, Dermocarpa, Fischerella, Oscillatoria, Prochlrococcus, Synechococcus, Chlorophyta were detected. Fungal assemblages comprised Aspergillus nidulans, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Alternaria alternata, Mortierella ramanniana, Penicillium verrucosum, Scopulariopsis fusca, Cladophialophora minutissima, Chaetomium gracile, Phoma herbarum, Phialophora fastigiata, Ulocladium consortiale and Candida sp. Actinomycetes were identified by morphological and chemotaxonomic assessment of cell-wall aminoacids and sugars as Streptomyces, Nocardia and Geodermatophilus. Some of the isolated microorganisms formed extracellular enzymes, others biosynthesized substances with antifungal and antibacterial activities. Single psychrotrophic strains have an ability to grow on n-paraffins and naphthalene, and thin-layer chromatographic analyses showed that they synthesized glycolipids. Assays for sugar moiety revealed that they contained different pentoses such as arabinose, xylose or deoxyhexose as rhamnose.

AB  - Aerobiological sampling was conducted year-round at three sites on Signy Island, maritime Antarctic, between December 1992 and January 1994, and during the summer at a fourth coastal site. The concentrations of keratinaceous particles were monitored. Feather fragments were the most abundant of all particle types trapped. Seal hairs were also common, particularly on the coast. Numbers of both particle types were most common in the air in summer. The Antarctic soil fungus Geomyces pannorum, which is able to utilize keratin-based substrates, was also present in aerobiological samples on Signy Island. G. pannorum was only found during early winter on the year-round sampling sites. It was more abundant during summer in the air at the coastal site, which was more heavily influenced by seals, birds and humans. Skuas were swabbed when they returned to the island early in summer. G. pannorum was recovered in culture, suggesting that these birds may act as vectors for the transport of microorganisms between Antarctica and more northern landmasses. Organic material deposited on snow was concentrated on the soil at the edge of the ice cap by melt wash, making additional keratin and other organic substrates available to soil microorganisms.

AB  - Aspergillus fumigatus is a common opportunistic pathogen in different animals, including birds such as penguins. For the first time, a fungal strain identified as A. fumigatus was isolated from soil in the nests of gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua, on Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands (maritime Antarctica). This isolate (A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829) displayed a series of potentially pathogenic characteristics in vitro. We evaluated its detailed molecular taxonomy and submitted the A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829 Antarctic strain to in vivo pathogenic modelling. The isolate was confirmed to represent A. fumigatus morphological and phylogenetic analysis showed that it was closely related to A. fumigatus sequences reported from animals, immunosuppressed humans, storage grains, plants and soils. The strain displayed the best mycelial growth and conidia production at 37 degrees C; however, it was also able to grow and produce conidia at 15 degrees, demonstrating its capability to survive and colonize penguin nest at least in the summer season in maritime Antarctica. In pathogenicity tests, healthy mice did not showed symptoms of infection; however, 50% lethality was observed in immunosuppressed mice that were inoculated with 106 and 107 spores. Lethality increased to 100% when inoculated with 108 spores. Our data highlight the potential pathogenicity of opportunistic A. fumigatus that may be present in the Antarctic, and the risks of both their further transfer within Antarctica and outwards to other continents, risks which may be exacerbated due global climatic changes.

AB  - We assessed the diversity of culturable fungi associated with rocks of continental Antarctica to evaluate their physiological opportunistic virulence potential in vitro. The seventy fungal isolates obtained were identified as nine species of Acremonium, Byssochlamys, Cladosporium, Debaryomyces, Penicillium, and Rhodotorula. Acremonium sp., D. hansenii, P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, P. tardochrysogenum, and R. mucilaginosa were able to grow at 37 degrees C; in addition, B. spectabilis displayed a high level of growth at 37 and 45 degrees C. Thirty-one isolates of P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, and P. tardochrysogenum were able to produce partial haemolysis on blood agar at 37 degrees C. Acremonium sp., P. citrinum, and P. tardochrysogenum showed spore sizes ranging from 2.81 to 5.13 mu m diameters at 37 degrees C. Of these, P. chrysogenum and P. tardochrysogenum displayed macro- and micro morphological polymorphism. Our results suggest that rocks of the ultra-extreme cold and dry environment of Antarctica harbour cryptic fungi phylogenetically close to opportunistic pathogenic and mycotoxigenic taxa with physiologic virulence characteristics in vitro.

AB  - Fungi isolated from environmentally challenging habitats can have adaptations of potential value when developed as insect pest-controls. Fungal isolates collected from Antarctica, Geomyces sp. I, Geomyces sp. II, Mortierella signyensis and M. alpina, were investigated for (i) growth characteristics at 0-35 degrees C, (ii) spore production at 10 and 20 degrees C, (iii) viability following exposure to freezing temperatures, and (iv) insecticidal activity against waxmoths (Galleria mellonella L.), houseflies (Musca domestica L.), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.) and black vine weevils (Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fabricius). All isolates showed growth between 5-20 degrees C, with some showing growth outside this range. Geomyces isolates sporulated over a wider range of conditions than the Mortierella isolates. Spore germination at 10 degrees C was higher for Geomyces sp. II when this isolate was produced at 10 compared to 20 degrees C (greatest difference 74.6 vs 32.7%). All isolates grew, with the exception of M. alpina, following exposure to -20 degrees C for 4 weeks. Insecticidal investigations showed M. alpina and M. signyensis caused significant mortality of waxmoth and housefly larvae via injection and soil inoculation, and M. alpina caused significant mortality of housefly larvae via baiting; the Geomyces isolates had little lethal effect.

AB  - Isolation and extreme environmental conditions have significantly impacted terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity in Antarctica, with glacial cycles further limiting animal diversity to a small number of species. Among these, springtails are relatively abundant, though their taxonomic diversity remains low. Antarctic glaciers may serve as major dispersal barriers, leading to high levels of genetic divergence among isolated populations. In Victoria Land (continental Antarctica), the Tucker Glacier has been proposed as an example of such a barrier; however, different species or taxa may respond differently to the same geographical features. In this study, we tested whether geographic distance, major glacier tongues, and seawater channels influence the distribution of Kaylathalia klovstadi (Collembola; Isotomidae) in Northern Victoria Land. We conducted mitochondrial DNA haplotype analysis on fragments of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and ATP synthase 6 (atp6) in 62 individuals from six K. klovstadi populations. Our analysis provides new insights into the genetic diversity and distribution patterns of K. klovstadi by incorporating additional sampling sites, specimens, and molecular markers. We challenge previous views regarding the role of the Tucker Glacier as a significant physical barrier to springtail dispersal in Northern Victoria Land. Our findings suggest that the impact of physical barriers on the genetic diversity of Antarctic Collembola, including the species studied here, requires a more careful evaluation.
   L'isolamento e le condizioni ambientali estreme hanno avuto un impatto significativo sulla biodiversit & agrave; degli invertebrati terrestri in Antartide, con i cicli glaciali che hanno ulteriormente limitato la diversit & agrave; animale a un numero ridotto di specie. Tra queste, i collemboli sono relativamente abbondanti, sebbene la loro diversit & agrave; tassonomica rimanga bassa. I ghiacciai antartici possono fungere da barriere significative per la dispersione delle specie, portando a livelli elevati di divergenza genetica tra popolazioni isolate. Nella Terra di Vittoria (Antartide continentale), il Ghiacciaio Tucker & egrave; stato proposto come esempio di tali barriere; tuttavia, specie diverse di collemboli potrebbero essere influenzate in modo diverso dalle stesse caratteristiche geografiche. In questo studio, abbiamo valutato se la distanza geografica, i principali ghiacciai e i canali d'acqua marina influenzano la distribuzione di Kaylathalia klovstadi (Collembola; Isotomidae) nella parte settentrionale della Terra di Vittoria. Abbiamo condotto un'analisi aplotipica del DNA mitocondriale su frammenti della subunit & agrave; 1 della citocromo c ossidasi (cox1) e della ATP sintasi 6 (atp6) in 62 esemplari provenienti da sei popolazioni di K. klovstadi. La nostra analisi fornisce nuove informazioni sulla diversit & agrave; genetica e sui modelli di distribuzione di K. klovstadi, incorporando siti di campionamento aggiuntivi, nuovi esemplari e marcatori molecolari. I risultati mettono in discussione il ruolo del Ghiacciaio Tucker come barriera fisica significativa per la dispersione di alcune specie di collemboli nella parte settentrionale della Terra di Vittoria. I nostri risultati suggeriscono che l'impatto delle barriere fisiche sulla diversit & agrave; genetica dei collemboli antartici, inclusa la specie studiata in questo caso, debba essere valutato pi & ugrave; accuratamente.

AB  - Aims The control of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri), causal agent of citrus canker, relies heavily on integrated agricultural practices involving the use of copper-based chemicals. Considering the need for alternatives to control this disease and the potential of fungi from extreme environments as producers of bioactive metabolites, we isolated and identified a bioactive compound from Penicillium sp. CRM 1540 isolated from Antarctica marine sediment. Methods and Results The potential of compound as an antibacterial agent against X. citri was assessed through in vitro and greenhouse experiments. Molecular taxonomy indicates that this fungus is a possible new species of Penicillium. Results revealed 90% bacterial inhibition in vitro at 25 mu g ml(-)(1) and a decrease in 75.37% of citrus canker symptoms emergency in vivo in treated leaves of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck considering the number of lesions per cm(2) (p < 0.05) in comparison with the control. The structure of the active agent was identified as penicillic acid based on a detailed spectroscopic analysis. Conclusion Penicillic acid can be an alternative against citrus canker. Significance and Impact of Study Research into extremophile micro-organisms can identify molecules with biotechnological potential and alternatives to current agricultural practices.

AB  - Pseudomonas putida MCCC 1A00316 was originally isolated from an Antarctic soil and has demonstrated potential nematicidal activity. Thus, it has promising applications for the biological control of Meloidogyne incognita. The larval mortality and egg-hatching inhibition rates of M. incognita will increase with the rising concentration of culture filtrates of P. putida MCCC 1A00316 and the duration of exposure. Thus, this study aimed to separate, purify, and identify nematicidal compounds from P. putida MCCC 1A00316 and to validate their anti-M. incognita activities. Compounds were purified through silica gel column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Structural identification was conducted through liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, C-13-NMR, and Marfey's method. The isolated compounds were identified as cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) on the basis of the results of the above analyses and previously reported data. The effects of various concentrations of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) on the mortality rates of second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. incognita were investigated. Results showed that HPLC-purified cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) displayed nematicidal activities. The mortality rate of M. incognita J2 reached 84.3% after 72 h of exposure to 67.5 mg/L cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu). The lowest egg-hatching rate (9.74%) was observed after 8 days of incubation with 2000 mg/L cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu). An egg-hatching rate of 53.11% was obtained under the control treatment (sterile distilled water). However, cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) did not elicit chemotaxis activity to M. incognita. This is the first work to investigate the anti-M. incognita characteristics of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu).

AB  - A wide diversity of micromycetes from various taxonomic groups in acidic and neutral soils is known from the literature data. In the present work, the fungi isolated from these soils and capable of growth at high pH are analyzed. The fungi were isolated from acidic sod-podzol and neutral cultivated soils by plating on alkaline agar (pH 10.0-10.5). Their identification was carried out using morphological, cultural, and molecular genetic criteria. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and the rates of linear growth within a broad pH range (4.0-10.4) were determined. The isolates represented a polyphyletic group of ascomycetes (Sordariomycetes), which included members of Plectosphaerellaceae (5 species) and various families of Hypocreales (4 species). The most common species were Gibellulopsis nigrescens, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus, Chordomyces antarcticum, and Plectosphaerella spp. Investigation of fungal growth at different pH values revealed all isolates to be alkalitolerant, with no alkaliphilic fungi isolated from acidic sod-podzol and neutral cultivated soils. Although the group of isolates was polyphyletic and its members originated from different ecological and trophic niches, most alkalitolerant isolates exhibited common morphological traits with acremonium- and verticillium-like conidial spore formation, abundant slime formation, and a tendency for aggregation of their mycelium in bundles. Our research confirmed the presence of fungi with alkalitolerant adaptation to external pH in the sod-podzolic and cultivated soils of the Moscow region.

AB  - Extremely acidic soils (pH < 3) harbour mycobiota that are different from less acidic habitats and are dominated by a small number of fungal species. During investigation of the mycobiota of highly acidic soils in the Czech Republic and Iceland, a group of melanised fungal isolates was obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS region, SSU, LSU), the isolates were accommodated by three phylogenetic lineages within the family Teratosphaeriaceae (Capnodiales, Dothideomycetes). The first lineage is here described as a new acidotolerant genus and species Acidiella bohemica gen. nov. et sp. nov. The most closely related species to this new clade are other extremotolerant fungi isolated from rocks and lichens collected in the Alps and Antarctica as well as leaf-spotting species and opportunistic human pathogens. The isolates belonging to the second and the third lineages were identified as the recently described acidophilic fungi Acidomyces acidophilus and Teratosphaeria acidotherma, respectively. The taxonomic status of both sister species is discussed and the latter species is ascribed here to the genus Acidomyces.

AB  - Two species of coniferous silicified wood are described from the El Freno Formation (Lower Jurassic) at Cerro La Brea, on the southern margin of the Atuel River, southern Mendoza Province, Argentina. Agathoxylon liguaensis Torres and Philippe (Araucariaceae) and the new species Podocarpoxylon atuelensis sp. nov. (Podocarpaceae) were described based on a detailed description of the secondary xylem. Wood specimens are well preserved, although some sections display variably decaying cell-walls typical of white-rotting by extant fungi. Vegetative and sexual structures in the degraded areas are identifiable as basidiomycetes. This is consistent with fungal saprotrophism and supports the role of fungi in the recycling of the organic matter in Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems. Considering the available geochronologic and biostratigraphic data and the current lithostratigraphic settings proposed for the unit, the age of the El Freno Formation at the studied locality can be constrained to the Hettangian-Sinemurian.

AB  - In northern forests, belowground sequestration of nitrogen (N) in complex organic pools restricts nutrient availability to plants. Oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi may aid plant N acquisition by providing access to N in macromolecular complexes. We test the hypotheses that ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species produce Mn-dependent peroxidases, and that the activity of these enzymes declines at elevated concentrations of inorganic N.
   In a boreal pine forest and a sub-arctic birch forest, Cortinarius DNA was assessed by 454-sequencing of ITS amplicons and related to Mn-peroxidase activity in humus samples with- and without previous N amendment. Transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes was investigated in field samples. Phylogenetic analyses of Cortinarius peroxidase amplicons and genome sequences were performed.
   We found a significant co-localization of high peroxidase activity and DNA from Cortinarius species. Peroxidase activity was reduced by high ammonium concentrations. Amplification of mRNA sequences indicated transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes under field conditions. The Cortinarius glaucopus genome encodes 11 peroxidases - a number comparable to many white-rot wood decomposers.
   These results support the hypothesis that some ectomycorrhizal fungi - Cortinarius species in particular - may play an important role in decomposition of complex organic matter, linked to their mobilization of organically bound N.

AB  - The Antarctic fungus Cadophora malorum produces previously undescribed cyclic heptapeptides (cadophorin A and B) containing an anthranilic acid residue. The planar structure of these peptides was determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry combined with extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of the amino acids was determined by Marfey's method, with HPLC analysis of FDVA (N alpha-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorphenyl)-L-valinamide) derivatives making use of a PFP column. Remarkably, cadophorin 2 possesses both the uncommon D-Ile and D-allo-Ile in its structure. The peptides have metal binding properties as shown by LCMS with post column addition of metal salt solutions. These results were supported by DFT calculations.

AB  - We characterized the fungal community found in the winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula. From the samples of snow, 234 fungal isolates were obtained and could be assigned to 51 taxa of 26 genera. Eleven yeast species displayed the highest densities; among them, Phenoliferia glacialis showed a broad distribution and was detected at all sites that were sampled. Fungi known to be opportunistic in humans were subjected to antifungal minimal inhibition concentration. Debaryomyces hansenii, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium sp. 3, and Penicillium sp. 4 displayed resistance against the antifungals benomyl and fluconazole. Among them, R. mucilaginosa isolates were able to grow at 37 degrees C. Our results show that the winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula contains a diverse fungal community dominated by cosmopolitan ubiquitous fungal species previously found in tropical, temperate, and polar ecosystems. The high densities of these cosmopolitan fungi suggest that they could be present in the air that arrives at the Antarctic Peninsula by air masses from outside Antarctica. Additionally, we detected environmental fungal isolates that were resistant to agricultural and clinical antifungals and able to grow at 37 degrees C. Further studies will be needed to characterize the virulence potential of these fungi in humans and animals.

AB  - Three new indolyl diketopiperazine derivatives, penillines A and B (1 and 3), isopenilline A (2), together with seven known alkaloid compounds (E)-3-(1H-imidazole-4-yimethylene)-6-(1H-indl-3-ylmethyl)-2,5-piperazinediol (4), penilloid A (5), meleagrin (6), neoxaline (7), questiomycin A (8), N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-acetamide (9), 2-benzoxazolinone (10), were isolated from the Antarctic soil-derived fungus Penicillium sp. SCSIO 05705. The new structures of 1-3 were elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR, mass spectra, CD spectra, and quantum chemical calculations. All the isolated compounds were tested for their antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2), antituberculosis, antibacterial, and cytotoxic activities. Among them, compounds 6-8 had significant in vitro cytotoxicities against the K562, MCF-7, A549, U937, Hela, DU145, HL60, and HT29 cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 2.73 to 17.7 mu M. In addition, compound 8 showed potent antituberculosis activity with an MIC value of 3.91 mu M, and the inhibition effect was close to the positive control INH (isoniazid, MIC 2.04 mu M). A possible biogenesis pathway for compounds 1-7 was proposed.

AB  - Extremely acidic soils (pH < 3) harbour poorly diversified mycobiota that are very different from less acidic habitats. During investigations of the mycobiota from several highly acidic soils in the Czech Republic and a coastal site in the Antarctic Peninsula, a group of hyaline fungal isolates was obtained. Based on phenotype and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS region, SSU, LSU), the isolates belonged to three phylogenetic lineages within two different classes, Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes (Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). The first lineage is described here as a new genus and species Acidothrix acidophila gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Amplistromataceae, Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota). The most closely related species to this new clade are wood-inhabiting fungi. The isolates belonging to the second and the third lineages are also described as two new genera and species Acidea extrema gen. nov. et sp. nov. and Soosiella minima gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Helotiales, Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota). Their position and the relationships within Helotiales are discussed. Soosiella minima was acidotolerant, Acidothrix acidophila and Acidea extrema exhibited both acidotolerant and acidophilic characteristics. All the species were slightly halophilic. The adaptation of hyaline fungi from mesophilic lineages to highly acidic environments has been revealed. The association between highly acidic and Antarctic habitats is discussed.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated with high frequency from samples of ornithogenic soil collected from an Adelie penguin rookery at Hallet Station, Antarctica. While A. fumigatus has been well documented as the principal incitant of aspergillosis among penguins in captivity, this represents the 1st report of its presence in antarctic materials. A. flavus and A. ustus were also found in the Hallett samples. In a comparable number of soil and guano samples from isolated Adelie rookeries on Foyn Island and Possession Island, these fungi were not encountered. Their presence at Hallett Station may be the result of human contamination. A brief consideration of epidemiological implications is given.

AB  - . We expanded our knowledge of the Cladonia cariosa group by seeking out and sequencing squamulose epodetiate Cladonia specimens in western North America. Cladonia galindezii, a species in the Cladonia cariosa group with large squamules forming thick mats and often containing porphyrilic acid, as in the type specimen from Antarctica, was found in several western states, new to the United States. In the same clade were specimens with atranorin only or atranorin with norstictic acid. We also establish Cladonia andereggii as another species in the C. cariosa group, from Idaho and Washington, based on sequencing new specimens from near the type locality. Although C. andereggii resembles C. symphycarpa in having norstictic acid-containing medium-sized squamules, ITS sequences of C. andereggii showed that it is more closely related to C. cariosa than to C. symphycarpa. We also demonstrated chemical diversity in the remainder of the C. cariosa group in western North America, with five chemotypes, all with atranorin, most frequently with atranorin only, less frequently with porphyrilic acid, homosekikaic acid, norstictic acid, or fumarprotocetraric acid, some of these in combination with rangiformic acid. While C. andereggii consistently contained norstictic acid and atranorin, C. galindezii and the remainder of C. cariosa s.l. varied in major substances.

AB  - Lipases have applications for the industrial processing of lipids, including concentrating and/or modifying fish oil derived omega-3 fatty acids, widely used as nutritional supplement and functional food ingredients. A range of para-nitrophenol (pNP) acyl esters were synthesised as a means to rapidly screen lipases for fatty acid selectivity using spectrophotometric detection. The chosen esters were based primarily on the most abundant fatty acids present in anchovy and tuna oils. pNP derivatives of C16:1 n-7, C18:1 n-9 (OA), C18:2 n-6 (LA), C18:3 n-3 (ALA), C20:5 n-3 (EPA) and C22:6 n-3 (DMA) were synthesised. Storage stability of these pNP derivatives was shown to be at least 6 months and all pNP derivatives, including those of EPA and DHA, were shown to be stable throughout the conditions of the assay. We applied the new assay substrates for the determination of fatty acid selectivity of five widely utilised lipases. Results showed that the lipase from Candida rugosa was the most selective in terms of omega-3 specificity, preferentially hydrolysing all other medium long-chain substrates. Lipases from Rhizomucor miehei and Thermomyces lanuginosa also showed selectivity, with a significant preference for saturated fatty acids. Candida antarctica lipase B and Aspergillus niger lipase were the least selective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Antarctic cryptoendolithic fungi of the ice-free desert could have evolved genetically and geographically isolated since the separation of the Continent from the Gondwanaland. The resulting harsh environmental conditions due to the migration of Antarctica to the South Pole led to a strong selective pressure possibly promoting adaptive radiation and speciation. Microorganisms evolved during this unique process are adapted to colonize what is known as the closest Martian environment on Earth. For this reason they have been already suggested as the best eukaryotic model for exobiological speculations. The results on freeze and thawing, UV exposure and osmotic stress tolerance here reported highlight an uncommon ability of surviving under these external pressures. Studies on their ability to withstand space conditions are in progress in view of the opportunity of direct space exposure on the International Space Station. The results could give new tools to solve the conflict concerning the Panspermia hypothesis. (c) 2007 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dust has been widely recognised as an important source of nutrients in the marine environment and as a vector for transporting pathogenic microorganisms. Disturbingly, in the wake of a dust storm event along the eastern Australian coast line in 2009, the Continuous Plankton Recorder collected masses of fungal spores and mycelia (~150,000 spores/m(3)) forming a floating raft that covered a coastal area equivalent to 25 times the surface of England. Cultured A. sydowii strains exhibited varying metabolite profiles, but all produced sydonic acid, a chemotaxonomic marker for A. sydowii. The Australian marine fungal strains share major metabolites and display comparable metabolic diversity to Australian terrestrial strains and to strains pathogenic to Caribbean coral. Secondary colonisation of the rafts by other fungi, including strains of Cladosporium, Penicillium and other Aspergillus species with distinct secondary metabolite profiles, was also encountered. Our bioassays revealed that the dust-derived marine fungal extracts and known A. sydowii metabolites such as sydowic acid, sydowinol and sydowinin A adversely affect photophysiological performance (F-v/F-m) of the coral reef dinoflagellate endosymbiont Symbiodinium. Different Symbiodinium clades exhibited varying sensitivities, mimicking sensitivity to coral bleaching phenomena. The detection of such large amounts of A. sydowii following this dust storm event has potential implications for the health of coral environments such as the Great Barrier Reef.

AB  - Increasing interest in the ecological roles, conservation and biotechnological potential of Antarctic microbiota has focused attention on their biodiversity and evolutionary origins. Antarctic microbial ecosystems provide useful models for general questions in evolutionary ecology given the relative isolation of the South Polar Region, the severe biological constraints imposed by the polar environment, and the absence of higher plants and animals in some Antarctic habitats. Sealed environments such as Lake Vostok and the overlying East Antarctic ice sheet provide unique, natural culture collections for studying microorganisms that have been isolated from the global gene pool over timescales of evolutionary significance. Most Antarctic environments, however, continue to receive microbial propagules from outside the region, as indicated by spore trap data, the microflora found in Antarctic snow and ice, the colonising taxa at geothermal sites, and the high frequency of apparently cosmopolitan species in most habitats. Differences in environmental stability and selection pressure among environments are likely to influence the degree of adaptive radiation and microbial endemism. The latter seems greater in the Southern Ocean by comparison with non-marine ecosystems of Antarctica, although there is some evidence of endemic species in highly specialised niches on the continent such. as in the endolithic habitat and saline lakes. Analytical techniques such as 16S rDNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridisation are beginning to provide new insights into the genetic affinities and biodiversity of Antarctic microbiota, and are leading to a more rigorous evaluation of microbial endemism.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) is frequently used to infer distributions of microorganisms in Antarctica. Their distributions relative to environmental variables are, in turn, sometimes used to infer their physiological range (and a relationship between the two is generally assumed for conservation purposes). We sought to determine whether ecological inferences based on distributions accurately reflect tolerances of the organisms concerned, using 249 legacy non-marine samples from a latitudinal gradient between 72 and 86 degrees S, Antarctica. A cyanobacterium, a heterotrophic bacterium, two eukaryotic algae, two fungi, and a moss were isolated into culture, and their field distributions inferred using eDNA analysis of the samples above. Tolerances of each organism with respect to environmental predictors were then inferred from the eDNA distribution and metadata using Generalised Additive Models. We then measured growth of the cultured isolates in response to a set of these predictors. Laboratory responses were then compared to inferences from the eDNA/metadata. Predictions from eDNA/metadata agreed with the results of physiological laboratory experiments for strains that were detected at high taxonomic resolution in the field samples. However, errors were never completely eliminated, and direct contradictions occurred when strains were represented at lower taxonomic resolution in the field data. We found that accurate ecological inference from eDNA studies would be best achieved via maximising both taxonomic resolution (through marker choice/read length) and ecological signal (through careful sampling design and rigorous metadata collection).

AB  - The Antarctic continent harbors unique ecosystems, including diverse microbial communities inhabiting rocky substrates. Despite extensive research on Antarctic microbial ecology, a gap in knowledge persists regarding the comparative analysis of microbial communities associated with Antarctic granite rocks and the microenvironment created by the thalli of the epilithic lichens growing on them. The present study addresses this gap. Using high-throughput sequencing approaches we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of fungal and bacterial communities colonizing endolithic and epilithic niches on granites in Antarctica. Our results revealed distinct differences between endolithic and epilithic communities in terms of diversity and composition. Lecanoromycetes was the most frequent fungal class in both groups, which accounts for 78.5% in the endolithic and 53.5% in the epilithic samples, respectively. The prevalence of lichenized fungi in both habitats suggests their pivotal role in shaping the diversity and composition of the Antarctic microbial communities. Endolithic communities exhibited higher bacterial diversity, most probably influenced by a combination of environmental factors and the complex interplay between lichens and other microorganisms. Stress-resistant bacterial taxa, as the radioresistant Truepera and Rubrobacter species were specifically found in the endolithically colonized specimens, suggesting that the endolithic lifestyle promotes a more specific ability to adapt throughout environmental extremes. Moreover, the endolithic niche in granites seems to positively select cyanobacteria, as they were found to play a significant role in endolithic communities, demonstrating their adaptability to low-light conditions and their importance in nutrient cycling. Overall, our findings shed light on the ecological dynamics of microbial communities in extreme environments and highlight the importance of further research to elucidate their roles in Antarctic ecosystems.

AB  - The surface temperatures of Antarctic soils and bryophyte colonies can fluctuate from close to freezing point to approximately 20 degrees C under clear skies around solar noon during midsummer. However, whether diurnally fluctuating temperatures influence the growth and metabolic activities of fungi inhabiting these substrates remains unknown. Here, 10 isolates of Pseudogymnoascus roseus, an ascomycete that is widespread in Antarctica, were exposed in vitro to temperatures fluctuating daily from 2 degrees C to 15-24 degrees C. Relative to controls incubated at the constant mean temperature of each treatment, temperatures fluctuating from 2 degrees C to >= 18 degrees C inhibited the growth of all isolates by 10-51% at 24 h and 48 h, and by up to 79% for individual isolates. Over a period of 21 days, all fluctuating temperature treatments reduced mean growth rates by between 3% and 48%, but had few effects on specific (-glucosidase activity, a proxy measure for metabolic activity. It is concluded that temperatures fluctuating diurnally to >= 18 degrees C during summer in mesic Antarctic soils and bryophyte colonies, exacerbated by the occurrence of climate-change associated heatwaves, are likely to inhibit the growth of P. roseus and perhaps also other ecologically important fungi.

AB  - We characterized the diversity of cultivable fungal assemblages associated with the bryospheres of the bipolar mosses Polytrichastrum alpinum and Polytrichastrum juniperinum resident in King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctica. From different parts of the mosses, 160 fungal isolates were obtained and identified using molecular biology methods as 43 taxa of 28 distinct genera. Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Mrakia gelida, Pseudogymnoascus sp., Melanodiplodia sp., and Vishniacozyma victoriae were the dominant taxa and displayed the highest values of frequency. Ecological diversity indices showed that the fungal assemblages were high but ranged among the mosses. Fungi of the bryospheres of both mosses showed different colonization patterns. Only A. psychrotrophicus, M. gelida, Pseudogymnoascus sp., and Leotiomycetidae sp. occurred as endophytes, epiphytes, and in the rhizoidosphere of P. alpinum. In contrast, the bryosphere of P. juniperinum did not show a single common fungus across its different portions. Our results show that the bryosphere of the bipolar Antarctic mosses seem to represent an interesting hostspot of fungal diversity dominated by cosmopolitan cold-adapted and endemic species recognized as symbionts and decomposer species. The high fungal diversity detected suggests that the Antarctic mosses may offer a protected microhabitat (bryosphere) favorable for the survival, dispersal, and colonization of symbionts and decomposer fungi in the different extreme environments of Antarctica.

AB  - Multiple drivers shape the spatial distribution of species, including dispersal capacity, niche incumbency, climate variability, orographic barriers, and plate tectonics. However, biogeographic patterns of fungi commonly do not fit conventional expectations based on studies of animals and plants. Fungi, in general, are known to occur across exceedingly broad, intercontinental distributions, including some important components of biological soil crust communities (BSCs). However, molecular data often reveal unexpected biogeographic patterns in lichenized fungal species that are assumed to have cosmopolitan distributions. The lichen-forming fungal species Psora decipiens is found on all continents, except Antarctica and occurs in BSCs across diverse habitats, ranging from hot, arid deserts to alpine habitats. In order to better understand factors that shape population structure in cosmopolitan lichen-forming fungal species, we investigated biogeographic patterns in the cosmopolitan taxon P. decipiens, along with the closely related taxa P. crenata and P. saviczii. We generated a multi-locus sequence dataset based on a worldwide sampling of these taxa in order to reconstruct evolutionary relationships and explore phylogeographic patterns. Both P. crenata and P. decipiens were not recovered as monophyletic; and P. saviczii specimens were recovered as a monophyletic clade closely related to a number of lineages comprised of specimens representing P. decipiens. Striking phylogeographic patterns were observed for P. crenata, with populations from distinct geographic regions belonging to well-separated, monophyletic lineages. South African populations of P. crenata were further divided into well-supported sub-clades. While well-supported phylogenetic substructure was also observed for the nominal taxon P. decipiens, nearly all lineages were comprised of specimens collected from intercontinental populations. However, all Australian specimens representing P. decipiens were recovered within a single well-supported monophyletic clade consisting solely of Australian samples. Our study supports up to 10 candidate species-level lineages in P. decipiens, based on genealogical concordance and coalescent-based species delimitation analyses. Our results support the general pattern of the biogeographic isolation of lichen-forming fungal populations in Australia, even in cases where closely related congeners have documented intercontinental distributions. Our study has important implications for understanding factors influencing diversification and distributions of lichens associated with BSC.

AB  - Psychrotrophic yeasts were isolated from Antarctic soils, selected based on their ability to grow in apple juice at low temperatures, and were evaluated as potential biocontrol agents for the management of postharvest diseases of apple during cold storage. Among the species recovered, an isolate of Leucosporidium scottii, designated At17, was identified as a good biocontrol agent for blue and gray mold of two apple cultivars. The selected isolate produced soluble and volatile antifungal substances that were inhibitory to apple pathogens. Siderophore production was also demonstrated, but it did not appear to play a role in pathogen inhibition. The selected yeast had the capacity to form a biofilm when grown in apple juice, which is considered an important attribute of postharvest antagonists to successfully colonize wounds and intact fruit surfaces. At17 was resistant to commonly used postharvest fungicides, so application of a combination of low-dose fungicide along with the biocontrol agent could be used as an integrated management practice.

AB  - Ash from combustion of biofuels, for example wood chips, is often deposited as waste, but due to its high content of essential plant nutrients and alkalinity, it has been proposed to recycle ash as a fertilizer and liming agent in biofuel production forest. However, current legislation sets rather strict limitations for wood-ash application in biofuel production systems. The soil microfood web, that is microorganisms and their microfaunal grazers, protozoa and nematodes, is pivotal for essential ecosystem processes such as decomposition and plant nutrient release. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the impacts on microfood web structure and functioning must precede actions towards raising the currently allowed application rates. In a Danish Norway spruce plantation, we evaluate the impact of wood ash applied at dosages from 0 to the extreme case of 90 t ash ha(-1) on the microfood web, the bacterial community structure, soil content of inorganic nitrogen, organic matter, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we disentangled the direct effect of the disturbance imposed by ash per se, the associated pH increase and changes in prey abundance on individual organism groups in the microfood web. The SEM showed that the pH rise was the main driver of increasing abundances of culturable heterotrophic bacteria with increasing ash doses, and via trophical transfer, this also manifested as higher abundances of bacterial grazers. Fungal-feeding nematodes were unaffected by ash, whereas carnivorous/omnivorous nematodes decreased due to the direct effect of ash. Increasing ash doses enhanced the difference between bacterial communities of control plots and ash-amended plots. The ash-induced stimulation of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and bacterial grazers increased inorganic nitrogen availability at ash doses of 9 t ha(-1) and above. Hence, raised limits for ash application may potentially benefit tree growth via enhanced N mineralization activity of the soil food web.

AB  - The evaluation of fungal root endophytes of two multizonal mountain plant species (Soldanella carpatica and Homogyne alpine) in relation to altitude was conducted. The comparison of root colonization by coarse arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM F) and the fine AMF endophyte (Glomus tenue), as well as the presence of dark septate endophytes (DSE) were assessed along altitudinal gradients (1000-2050 m a.s.l.) oil calcareous and non-calcareous substrata in the Tatra Mts. (Western Carpathians). Additionally, AMF species composition in the rhizosphere of the investigated plants was determined. Coarse AMIF dominated over the fine endophyte in roots of S. carpatica and H. alpina, In the case of S. carpatica, there was a tendency for coarse AMF colonization decline with increasing altitude, while the reverse trend wits observed for the fine endophyte. In contrast, the altitudinal patterns of the two types were opposite in H. alpina. Fifteen AMF species associated with the rhizosphere of'S. carpatica were identified at the sites located in the Western Tatra Mountains, whereas spores of only our species were isolated from the rhizosphere of H. alpina in the High Tatra Mountains. None of the identified AMF species was observed to occur both in the High and Western Tatra Mts. DSE accompanied AMF in the roots of S. carpatica and H. alpina at each site: however, the root colonization by this group Of fungi was low. The DSE colonization did not have a consistent relationship with altitude in both plant species. The results suggest that at the investigated altitudes factors such as the type Of Substrata, host plants, and local plant species composition may play a more important role in determining root colonization as well as the establishment of a local AMF Community than the climatic changes with increasing elevation above sea level.

AB  - We evaluated the diversity and distribution of viable fungi present in permafrost and active layers obtained from three islands of Maritime Antarctica. A total of 213 fungal isolates were recovered from the permafrost, and 351 from the active layer, which were identified in 58 taxa; 27 from permafrost and 31 from the active layer. Oidiodendron, Penicillium, and Pseudogymnoascus taxa were the most abundant in permafrost. Bionectriaceae, Helotiales, Mortierellaceae, and Pseudeurotium were the most abundant in the active layer. Only five shared both substrates. The yeast Mrakia blollopis represented is the first reported on Antarctic permafrost. The fungal diversity detected was moderate to high, and composed of cosmopolitan, cold-adapted, and endemic taxa, reported as saprobic, mutualistic, and parasitic species. Our results demonstrate that permafrost shelters viable fungi across the Maritime Antarctica, and that they are contrasting to the overlying active layer. We detected important fungal taxa represented by potential new species, particularly, those genetically close to Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which can cause extinction of bats in North America and Eurasia. The detection of viable fungi trapped in permafrost deserves further studies on the extension of its fungal diversity and its capability to expand from permafrost to other habitats in Antarctica, and elsewhere.

AB  - Endophytic fungi form mutualistic associations with plant roots which can increase plant survival and resistance to stress. Recently, it has been proposed that endophytic fungi from Antarctica should be used to facilitate reintroduction and establishment of native plants in xeric environments of northern Chile. In this note, we suggest this is a risky proposition and may lead to biological invasions. It is difficult to predict which endophytic fungi will become invasive, where they will invade, or what their impacts will be. Organisms that move across continents may or may not become invasive depending on the interaction between the species and the invaded community; unexpected outcomes may occur due to adaptation and novel interactions of the introduced species in the new environment. The fact that these endophytes are mutualistic does not imply that they will not have negative effects on the recipient community, since they might promote invasion of other non-native species or may change the competitive relationships among native species. Further, taxonomically uncharacterized fungal isolates from plant roots are likely to contain non-beneficial species. The fact that these endophytic fungi species are from Antarctica does not ensure that they cannot invade elsewhere. It should be recognized that invasive microorganisms are extremely difficult to control. We strongly suggest that the further translocation, use and spread of endophytes from Antarctica should be halted until a risk assessment is undertaken. Biosecurity measures must be taken when considering transcontinental experiments. Based on previous experiences, it is likely that the risk and potential costs of introducing these new species significantly exceed any potential benefits of their introductions.

AB  - Fungi and yeasts isolated in pure culture from Antarctic permafrost collected at different depths in the McMurdo Dry Valleys were identified with cultural, physiological and molecular methods. Fungi belonged to the genera Penicillium, Eurotium, Cladosporium, Alternaria, Engyodonthium, Aureobasidium, Cordyceps, Rhizopus and yeasts to the genera Cryptococcus and Sporidiobolus. All the strains can be defined as mesophilic psychrotolerant. The molecular analyses revealed that these fungal genotypes do not deviate from the global gene pool of fungi commonly spreading worldwide at present, but possible ancestral strains have been found on the base of metabolic profiles.

AB  - Jurassic hot-spring chert deposits in the Deseado Massif, Patagonia, Argentina, have been known for over two decades, but the associated biota has only begun to be documented recently, and thus far only from a small number of localities. Here we report the discovery of a large complex of well-exposed Upper Jurassic epithermal siliceous deposits represented by organic-rich cherts preserved within the geothermal system from La Bajada, Santa Cruz, Argentina. The chert samples analyzed so far contain exceptionally well-preserved, in situ and transported, tri-dimensionally silicified plants, animals and microorganisms. Plants include equisetaleans (Equisetum thermale), ferns and gymnosperms. Among them, well-preserved in situ osmundaceous rhizomes in different developmental stages are the dominant component of the taphoflora. Conifers are represented by wood, seeds, leaves and pollen tentatively assigned to the families Araucariaceae and Cheirolepidiaceae. The assemblage also contains vegetative and reproductive structures of fungi, oomycetes, cyanobacteria, algae, testate amoebas, ciliates and numerous remains of unresolved taxonomic affinity. Microorganisms are preserved isolated in the chert matrix or directly associated with plants and other organic remains in mutualistic, parasitic and saprotrophic engagements. Also present are numerous coprolites and arthropod remains that, along with the named microorganisms, are indicative of trophic relationships in the ecosystem. Altogether, this fossil assemblage suggests that distal paleoenvironments within the geothermal system are preserved at La Bajada. The diversity, abundance, and exceptional preservation of fossils in the La Bajada ecosystem provides a unique window into the geological past that offers a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of middle Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Natural pigments have received special attention from the market and industry as they could overcome the harm to health and the environmental issues caused by synthetic pigments. These pigments are commonly extracted from a wide range of organisms, and when added to products they can alter/add new physical-chemical or biological properties to them. Fungi from extreme environments showed to be a promising source in the search for biomolecules with antimicrobial and antiparasitic potential. This study aimed to isolate fungi from Antarctic soils and screen them for pigment production with antimicrobial and antiparasitic potential, together with other previously isolated strains A total of 52 fungi were isolated from soils in front of the Collins Glacier (Southeast border). Also, 106 filamentous fungi previously isolated from the Collins Glacier (West border) were screened for extracellular pigment production. Five strains were able to produce extracellular pigments and were identified by ITS sequencing as Talaromyces cnidii, Pseudogymnoascus shaanxiensis and Pseudogymnoascus sp. All Pseudogymnoascus spp. (SC04.P3, SC3.P3, SC122.P3 and ACF093) extracts were able to inhibit S. aureus ATCC6538 and two (SC12.P3, SC32.P3) presented activity against Leishmania (L.) infantum, Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanossoma cruzii. Extracts compounds characterization by UPLC-ESI-QToF analysis confirmed the presence of molecules with biological activity such as: Asterric acid, Violaceol, Mollicellin, Psegynamide A, Diorcinol, Thailandolide A. In conclusion, this work showed the potential of Antartic fungal strains from Collins Glacier for bioactive molecules production with activity against Gram positive bacteria and parasitic protozoas.

AB  - We characterized the diversity, distribution, systematic colonization, and xerophilic capabilities of fungi associated with the Antarctic angiosperms Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica collected at different sites of the South Shetlands Islands, Antarctic Peninsula. A total of 684 fungal isolates were obtained and identified into 67 taxa from 32 genera. The highest fungal diversity and richness were obtained from the rhizosphere, roots, and leaves, in order, and only 11 taxa shared between both plants. Penicillium and Pseudogymnoascus were the dominant fungal genera. However, the rarefaction curves for plant fungal assemblages did not reach a plateau, suggesting that these Antarctic plants may host more fungi in their tissues and rhizospheres. A total of 460 isolates grew at water activity (a(w)) = 0.95, 200 at 0.90, 110 at 0.81, and 47 at 0.66. Antarctomyces, Cladosporium, Mortierella, Leptosphaeria, Penicillium, Pseudogymnoascus, and Thelebolus taxa grew at a(w) = 0.81 and 0.66 and considered highly xerophilic. In addition, specific isolates of Penicillium and Thelebolus exhibited the highest mycelial growth at a(w) = 0.66. Our results show that the internal tissues and rhizosphere of Antarctic angiosperms host rich and diverse fungal communities dominated by cold-adapted and endemic taxa, which seem to coexist as symbionts and decomposer fungi. In addition, specific fungi are able to colonize different parts of the plant, suggesting a high ecological relationship with their hosts. Finally, different fungi living in the rhizosphere displayed remarkable xerophilic tolerance, representing promising candidates for further biotechnological studies, including identification of genes for applications in industry and agriculture.

AB  - Melanised fungi were isolated from rock surfaces in the Central Mountain System of Spain. Two hundred sixty six isolates were recovered from four geologically and topographically distinct sites. Microsatellite-primed PCIR techniques were used to group isolates into genotypes assumed to represent species. One hundred and sixty three genotypes were characterised from the four sites. Only five genotypes were common to two or more sites. Morphological and molecular data were used to characterise and identify representative strains, but morphology rarely provided a definitive identification due to the scarce differentiation of the fungal structures or the apparent novelty of the isolates. Vegetative states of fungi prevailed in culture and in many cases could not be reliably distinguished without sequence data. Morphological characters that were widespread among the isolates included scarce micronematous conidial states, endoconidia, mycelia with dark olive-green or black hyphae, and mycelia with torulose, isodiametric or monifiform hyphae whose cells develop one or more transverse and/or oblique septa. In many of the strains, mature hyphae disarticulated, suggesting asexual reproduction by a thallic micronema:our conidiogenesis or by simple fragmentation. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2) and 5.8S rDNA gene were employed to investigate the phylogenetic affinities of the isolates. According to ITS sequence alignments, the majority of the isolates could be grouped among four main orders of Pezizomycotina: Pleosporales, Dothideales, Capnodiales, and Chaetothyriales. Ubiquitous known soil and epiphytic fungi species were generally absent from the rock surfaces. In part, the mycota of the rock surfaces shared similar elements with melanised fungi from plant surfaces and fungi described from rock formations in Europe and Antarctica. The possibility that some of the fungi were lichen mycobionts or lichen parasites could not be ruled out.

AB  - The filamentous fungus Phoma herbarum CCFEE 5080 isolated from continental Antarctica soil was tested for exopolysaccharide (EPS) production. The fungus grew and produced EPS (up to 13.6 g/l) on a variety of carbon sources among which sorbitol was best, particularly at the concentration of 60 g/l. EPS production was maximum when the nitrogen source was NaNO3 (3 g/l) and the incubation temperature was 28 degreesC. The polysaccharide was purified by repeated precipitation in ethanol and gel filtration and characterized as a homopolymer of glucose having a molecular weight of 7.412 x 10(6); structural analysis indicated the presence of beta-1,3 and beta-1,6 linkages only. After repeated freezing and thawing of the fungal biomass in the presence of EPS, the mycelial growth was much higher than that observed after freezing in the absence of EPS and the difference increased with the number of freeze-thaw cycles. It is hypothesized that the adaptation of P. herbarum CCFEE 5080 to the Antarctic soil microclimatic conditions, characterized by low temperature, high thermal fluctuations and repeated freeze-thaw cycles, might be related to the EPS production ability.

AB  - Acremonium is acknowledged as a highly ubiquitous genus including saprobic, parasitic, or endophytic fungi that inhabit a variety of environments. Species of this genus are extensively exploited in industrial, commercial, pharmaceutical, and biocontrol applications, and proved to be a rich source of novel and bioactive secondary metabolites. Acremonium has been recognised as a taxonomically difficult group of ascomycetes, due to the reduced and high plasticity of morphological characters, wide ecological distribution and substrate range. Recent advances in molecular phylogenies, revealed that Acremonium is highly polyphyletic and members of Acremonium s. lat. belong to at least three distinct orders of Sordariomycetes, of which numerous orders, families and genera with acremonium-like morphs remain undefined. To infer the phylogenetic relationships and establish a natural classification for acremonium-like taxa, systematic analyses were conducted based on a large number of cultures with a global distribution and varied substrates. A total of 633 cultures with acremonium-like morphology, including 261 ex-type cultures from 89 countries and a variety of substrates including soil, plants, fungi, humans, insects, air, and water were examined. An overview phylogenetic tree based on three loci (ITS, LSU, rpb2) was generated to delimit the orders and families. Separate trees based on a combined analysis of four loci (ITS, LSU, rpb2, tef-1a) were used to delimit species at generic and family levels. Combined with the morphological features, host associations and ecological analyses, acremonium-like species evaluated in the present study are currently assigned to 63 genera, and 14 families in Cephalothecales, Glomerellales and Hypocreales, mainly in the families Bionectriaceae, Plectosphaerelaceae and Sarocladiaceae and five new hypocrealean families, namely Chrysonectriaceae, Neoacremoniaceae, Nothoacremoniaceae, Pseudoniessliaceae and Valsonectriaceae. Among them, 17 new genera and 63 new combinations are proposed, with descriptions of 65 new species. Furthermore, one epitype and one neotype are designated to stabilise the taxonomy and use of older names. Results of this study demonstrated that most species of Acremonium s. lat. grouped in genera of Bionectriaceae, including the type A. alternatum. A phylogenetic backbone tree is provided for Bionectriaceae, in which 183 species are recognised and 39 well-supported genera are resolved, including 10 new genera. Additionally, rpb2 and tef-1a are proposed as potential DNA barcodes for the identification of taxa in Bionectriaceae.

AB  - Describing the total biodiversity of an environmental metacommunity is challenging due to the presence of cryptic and rare species and incompletely described taxonomy. How many samples to collect is a common issue that faces ecologists when designing fieldwork sampling. Nowadays, high-throughput sequencing allows examination of large numbers of samples enabling comprehensive biodiversity assessments. In this study, we sought to estimate how the scale of sampling affects accuracy of community diversity description in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Southern Victoria Land) in Antarctica accounted as the closest Martian analogue on Earth, exhibiting extreme conditions such as low temperatures, wide thermal fluctuations, low nutrient availability and high UV radiation. We found that sampling effort, based on accumulation curves and statistical analysis, had a considerable impact on assessing species richness and composition in these ecosystems, confirming that a sampling as large as nine rock specimens was necessary to detect almost all fungal species present, but was not sufficient to capture whole bacterial assemblage. The sampling would require approximately four times more effort (40 samples) for a comprehensive description of bacterial diversity. Our findings will be helpful to develop strategies to exhaustively describe the microbial diversity of Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities.

AB  - This article presents the results of microscopic fungi complexes in the areas of five Russian polar stations in East Antarctica and the Subantarctic. A total of 104 microfungal species have been identified. Seventy-seven fungal species have been detected in samples of soils and anthropogenic materials from polar stations of East Antarctica (Progress, Mirny, Molodezhnaya, and Druzhnaya 4) using mycological methods while, in the Bellingshausen station (Subantarctic), we have isolated 87 micromycete species. The number of fungi in soils varies from individual propagules in control soils to 94000 per 1 g of soil in contaminated areas. The largest number of species is represented by the genus Penicillium (26 species). Fungal species that form the core of mycobiota in most of the studied habitats have been identified. For soils of East Antarctica, it is formed by species of the genera Aureobasidium, Cadophora, Pseudogymnoascus (Geomyces), Thelebolus, and Phoma. Significant differences are established between the mycobiota of East Antarctica and that of the Subantarctic. At the same time, a general trend towards an increase in fungal species diversity and number in the areas of polar stations compared to the control (clean) sites for all studied areas is recorded. These data indicate that a significant part of micro-mycetes is introduced into the Antarctic by humans (anthropogenic invasion).

AB  - During a survey of the culturable soil fungal population in samples collected in Taylor Valley, South Victoria Land, Antarctica, 13 basidiomycetous yeast strains with orange-coloured colonies were isolated. Phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial LSU rRNA gene sequences showed that the strains belong to the Dioszegia clade of the Tremellales (Tremellomycetes, Agaricomycotina), but did not correspond to any of the hitherto recognized species. Two novel species, Dioszegia antarctica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-116(T) =CBS 10920(T) =PYCC 5970(T)) and Dioszegia cryoxerica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-071(T) =CBS 10919(T) =PYCC 5967(T)), are described to accommodate ten and three of these strains, respectively. Analysis of ITS sequences demonstrated intrastrain sequence heterogeneity in D. cryoxerica. The latter species is also notable for producing true hyphae with clamp connections and haustoria. However, no sexual structures were observed. The two novel species can be considered obligate psychrophiles, since they failed to grow above 20 degrees C and grew best between 10 and 15 degrees C.

AB  - A variety of culturing techniques were employed to isolate fungi from maritime Antarctic lakes. Although aquatic hyphomycetes were absent from all samples, several soil hyphomycetes were isolated. A variety of yeasts (mainly non-fermenting basidiomycetous forms) were also regularly encountered in all lake types investigated. Neither hyphomycetes nor yeasts were present in exceptional numbers despite the high counts previously recorded from surrounding catchment vegetation. In contrast, aquatic  phycomycetes were regularly encountered and appear to be present in substantial numbers, at least in the shallow margins of the lakes. A variety of forms were identified, comprising one hyphochytridiomycete, four genera of chytridiomycete and two oomycetes. All the fungi isolates obtained appeared to be psychotrophic. Results from this preliminary study are discussed in conjunction with data from previous Antarctic studies.

AB  - Amino acids play an important role in ecology as essential nutrients for animals and as currencies in symbiotic associations. Here we present a new approach to tracing the origins of amino acids by identifying unique patterns of carbon isotope signatures generated by amino acid synthesis in plants, fungi, and bacteria ("C-13 fingerprints''). We measured amino acid delta C-13 from 10 C-3 plants, 13 fungi, and 10 bacteria collected and isolated from a boreal forest in interior Alaska, USA, using gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). Microorganisms were cultured under amino-acid-free conditions and identified based on DNA sequences. Bacteria, fungi, and plants generated consistent, unique C-13 fingerprints based on the more complex amino acids (five or more biosynthetic steps) that are classified as essential for animals. Linear discriminant analysis classified all samples correctly with >99% certainty and correctly classified nearly all insect samples from a previous study by diet. Our results suggest that delta C-13 fingerprints of amino acids could provide a powerful in situ assay of the biosynthetic sources of amino acids and a potential new tool for understanding nutritional linkages in food webs.

AB  - Biomass productivity of black spruce trees is strongly limited by soil nitrogen (N) in shallow active layer on permafrost. Trees and mycorrhizal roots are known to absorb amino acids to bypass slow N mineralization in Nlimited boreal forest soils. However, amino acid uptake strategy of tree roots cannot fully explain their advantages in competition for soil N with other plants and microbes. We investigated the potentials of tree roots to absorb urea as well as amino acids and inorganic N, using tracer experiments of 13C, 15N-labelled glutamic acid and urea and 15N-labelled ammonium nitrate in black spruce forests growing on permafrost-affected soils with different permafrost table depths in the eastern edge of the Mackenzie river delta (northwest Canada). We demonstrated that black spruce roots have potentials to absorb intact urea but only in soils with shallow permafrost, where urea accumulates due to limited microbial mineralization activity. This contrasts with soils with deep permafrost table, where roots absorb amino acids and inorganic N. Allocation of fine roots to colder subsoil above permafrost provides advantages for trees monopolizing urea-N. Despite lower energy efficiency of urea utilization compared to inorganic N and amino acids, urea uptake is one of N acquisition strategies for spruce growing on N-limited subarctic soil.

AB  - The ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are dominated by nutrient-poor mineral soil and rocky outcrops. The principal habitat for microorganisms is within rocks (endolithic). In this environment, microorganisms are provided with protection against sub-zero temperatures, rapid thermal fluctuations, extreme dryness, and ultraviolet and solar radiation. Endolithic communities include lichen, algae, fungi, and a diverse array of bacteria. Chloroflexota is among the most abundant bacterial phyla present in these communities. Among the Chloroflexota are four novel classes of bacteria, here named Candidatus Spiritibacteria class. nov. (=UBA5177), Candidatus Martimicrobia class. nov. (=UBA4733), Candidatus Tarhunnaeia class. nov. (=UBA6077), and Candidatus Uliximicrobia class. nov. (=UBA2235). We retrieved 17 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that represent these four classes. Based on genome predictions, all these bacteria are inferred to be aerobic heterotrophs that encode enzymes for the catabolism of diverse sugars. These and other organic substrates are likely derived from lichen, algae, and fungi, as metabolites (including photosynthate), cell wall components, and extracellular matrix components. The majority of MAGs encode the capacity for trace gas oxidation using high-affinity uptake hydrogenases, which could provide energy and metabolic water required for survival and persistence. Furthermore, some MAGs encode the capacity to couple the energy generated from H2 and CO oxidation to support carbon fixation (atmospheric chemosynthesis). All encode mechanisms for the detoxification and efflux of heavy metals. Certain MAGs encode features that indicate possible interactions with other organisms, such as Tc-type toxin complexes, hemolysins, and macroglobulins.IMPORTANCEThe ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the coldest and most hyperarid desert on Earth. It is, therefore, the closest analog to the surface of the planet Mars. Bacteria and other microorganisms survive by inhabiting airspaces within rocks (endolithic). We identify four novel classes of phylum Chloroflexota, and, based on interrogation of 17 metagenome-assembled genomes, we predict specific metabolic and physiological adaptations that facilitate the survival of these bacteria in this harsh environment-including oxidation of trace gases and the utilization of nutrients (including sugars) derived from lichen, algae, and fungi. We propose that such adaptations allow these endolithic bacteria to eke out an existence in this cold and extremely dry habitat.

AB  - Ochrathinols A and B ((+/-)-1 and (+/-)-2), two undescribed sulfur-containing racemates, and ochracids A and B (3 and 4), two unprecedented pyrrolizidine alkaloids, were isolated from an Antarctic soil-derived fungus Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis SCSIO 05702. Their structures including absolute configurations were determined through extensive spectroscopic analysis, chiral-phase HPLC analysis, quantum ECD calculations, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. Ochrathinols A and B are unprecedented sulfur natural products featuring a novel 3-methylhex-ahydro-2H-cyclopenta [b]thiophene core. Interestingly, ochrathinol A ((+/-)-1) outstandingly suppressed the release of LPS-induced IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha inflammatory cytokines with concentration of 10 mu M and alleviated the unbalanced NAD+/NADH ratio caused by LPS in RAW264.7 macrophages.

AB  - Saxicolous rock ripe lichens that grow on rocks in the East Antarctic fellfields were sampled for phylotypic characterization of its constituent mycobionts (fungi) and photobionts (algae and cyanobacteria). The rock tripe lichen-forming fungal and algal phylotypes were classified under the common lichen-forming genera of ascomycetes, namely, Umbilicaria, and green algae, namely, Trebouxia and Coccomyxa. However, phylotypes of the green algal chloroplasts and the lichen-associated cyanobacteria showed unexpectedly high diversity. The detected chloroplast phylotypes were not fully affiliated with the green algal genera Trebouxia or Coccomyxa. The predominant chloroplast phylotype demonstrated maximum resemblance to Neglectella solitaria, which is neither a known Antarctic species nor a typical lichen photobiont. Another dominant chloroplast phylotype belonged to the atypical Antarctic green algae family. Cyanobacterial phylotypes were dominated by those affiliated with the Microcoleus species rather than the well-known lichen-associates, Nostoc species. The occurrences of these Microcoleus-affiliated cyanobacterial phylotypes were specifically abundant within the Yukidori Valley site, one of the Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA). The ASPA site, along with another 50 km-distant site, yielded most of the cryptic diversity in the phylotypes of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, which may contribute to the phenotypic variability within the rock tripe lichen photobionts.

AB  - A total of 564 isolates of endophytic fungi were recovered from the plants Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis collected from Antarctica. The isolates were screened against parasites Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi and against the human tumour cell lines. Of the 313 fungal isolates obtained from D. antarctica and 251 from C. quitensis, 25 displayed biological activity. Nineteen extracts displayed leishmanicidal activity, and six inhibited the growth of at least one tumour cell line. These fungi belong to 19 taxa of the genera Alternaria, Antarctomyces, Cadophora, Davidiella, Helgardia, Herpotrichia, Microdochium, Oculimacula, Phaeosphaeria and one unidentified fungus. Extracts of 12 fungal isolates inhibited the proliferation of L. amazonesis at a low IC50 of between 0.2 and 12.5 mu g ml(-1). The fungus Phaeosphaeria herpotrichoides displayed only leishmanicidal activity with an IC50 of 0.2 mu g ml(-1), which is equivalent to the inhibitory value of amphotericin B. The extract of Microdochium phragmitis displayed specific cytotoxic activity against the UACC-62 cell line with an IC50 value of 12.5 mu g ml(-1). Our results indicate that the unique angiosperms living in Antarctica shelter an interesting bioactive fungal community that is able to produce antiprotozoal and antitumoral molecules. These molecules may be used to develop new leishmanicidal and anticancer drugs.

AB  - Here we report the characterization of fungi from 10 accretion ice sections (3300-5100 y old) as well as two deep glacial ice sections that are close to the bottom of the glacier (1 000 000-2 000 000 y old) from the Vostok, Antarctica, 5G ice core. Fungi were characterized by fluorescence microscopy Culturing and sequence analyses of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers. A total of 270 fungal colonies were cultured from the accretion ice of subglacial Lake Vostok and an additional 14 from the glacial ice immediately above the accretion ice. Mean concentrations were 0-4.42 cells mL(-1) ice meltwater of which 0-100% exhibited viability (as determined by fluorescence microscopy). Thirty-one unique fungal ribosomal DNA sequences (28 from accretion ice and three from glacial ice) were determined and compared to recent taxa. The results, plus tests for growth at low temperatures, indicated that Lake Vostok contains a mixture of heterotrophic psychrotolerant fungal species. This indicates that the lake is not sterile but contains a unique ecosystem.

AB  - Soil fungal diversity plays a fundamental role in delivering key ecosystem goods and services. This article assesses diversity of saprobic soil and litter microfungi, as taxonomical and functional components which affect above- and below-ground relationships within Alpine and Mediterranean regions of Italy. We highlighted biodiversity high spots focusing on four research topics that have been developed over time and are currently in progress in Italy. Preliminary quantitative data concerning soil microfungi in the Raethian Alps showed a strong reduction of Colony Forming Unit (CFU)s with altitude. Keratinophilic microfungi in natural and anthropogenic environments were widespread among filamentous fungi and 121 species have been isolated in Italy since 1960. Heat stimulated microfungi in Mediterranean region soils showed high values both in abundance and species density even two years after the experimental fire, with Neosartorya spp. playing a pivotal role. The diversity of microfungi of Quercus ilex (150 species), in the Mediterranean region, higher than that in leaf litter of other species, was explained mainly by different forms of growth and the phytoclimatic characters of the areas under study.

AB  - Unraveling functional genes related to biodegradation of organic compounds has profoundly improved our understanding of biological remediation processes, yet the ecology of such genes is only poorly understood. We used a culture-independent approach to assess the abundance and diversity of bacteria catalyzing the degradation of n-alkanes with a chain length between C(5) and C(16) at a forest site co-contaminated with mineral oil hydrocarbons and metals for nearly 60 years. The alkB gene coding for a rubredoxin-dependent alkane monooxygenase enzyme involved in the initial activation step of aerobic aliphatic hydrocarbon metabolism was used as biomarker. Within the area of study, four different zones were evaluated: one highly contaminated, two intermediately contaminated, and a noncontaminated zone. Contaminant concentrations, hydrocarbon profiles, and soil microbial respiration and biomass were studied. Abundance of n-alkane-degrading bacteria was quantified via real-time PCR of alkB, whereas genetic diversity was examined using molecular fingerprints (T-RFLP) and clone libraries. Along the contamination plume, hydrocarbon profiles and increased respiration rates suggested on-going natural attenuation at the site. Gene copy numbers of alkB were similar in contaminated and control areas. However, T-RFLP-based fingerprints suggested lower diversity and evenness of the n-alkane-degrading bacterial community in the highly contaminated zone compared to the other areas; both diversity and evenness were negatively correlated with metal and hydrocarbon concentrations. Phylogenetic analysis of alkB denoted a shift of the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community from Gram-positive bacteria in the control zone (most similar to Mycobacterium and Nocardia types) to Gram-negative genotypes in the contaminated zones (Acinetobacter and alkB sequences with little similarity to those of known bacteria). Our results underscore a qualitative rather than a quantitative response of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria to the contamination at the molecular level.

AB  - Fungi are known to produce a range of extracellular enzymes and other secondary metabolites. Investment in extracellular enzyme production may be an important element of the survival strategy of these fungi in maritime Antarctic soils. This study focuses on fungi that were isolated from ornithogenic, undisturbed and human-impacted soils collected from the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, during the austral summer in February 2007. We (1) describe fungal diversity based on molecular approaches, (2) describe the thermal characteristics of the fungal isolates, and (3) screen extracellular hydrolase enzyme production (amylase and cellulase) by the isolates. Soil samples were cultured using the Warcup soil plating technique and incubated at 4 and 25 degrees C to allow basic thermal classification. In total, 101 isolates were obtained. All the isolates were screened at culture temperatures of 4 and 25 degrees C in order to detect activity of extracellular hydrolase enzymes. At 25 degrees C, ornithogenic penguin rookery soils recorded the lowest diversity of fungi, with little difference in diversity apparent between the other soils examined. At 4 degrees C, an undisturbed site recorded the lowest and a human-impacted site the highest diversity of fungi. The majority of the fungi identified in this study were in the mesophilic thermal class. Six strains possessed significant activity for amylase and 13 for cellulase at 25 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, four strains showed significant amylase and 22 significant cellulase activity. The data presented increase our understanding of microbial responses to environmental temperature.

AB  - Data are rather lacking on the diversity of microfungi associated with exotic plant substrates transported to continental Antarctica. We examined the diversity and species composition of microfungi associated with withering woody shoots of saplings of Salix spp. (willows) transplanted and in ground contact near Syowa Station, East Antarctica for more than 40 years. The willow saplings originated from Hokkaido, Northern Japan, and were experimentally transplanted in 1967-1968, but died within a few years. Dead willow shoots, unbranched and standing on bare ground for approximately 50 years, were used for the isolation of fungi with the surface disinfection method. A total of 43 isolates were retrieved from 32 (78 %) of the 41 shoots tested. The fungal isolates were classified into 18 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) based on the similarity of rDNA ITS sequences at the 97 % criterion. Leotiomycetes was the most common class in terms of the number of isolates and MOTUs, followed by Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes. Molecular phylogenetic affinities suggested that the closest relatives of the MOTUs were saprobic and root-associated fungi. The result of the present study suggested that Cadophora luteo-olivacea is widespread in soils throughout Antarctica and likely indigenous.

AB  - Fungi isolated from the leafy liverwort Cephaloziella exiliflrora collected in Australia and continental Antarctica were compared with Hymenoscyphus ericae using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region DNA sequences. The isolates displayed < 2.1% sequence divergence within the ITS region, indicating that the endophytes from C. exiliflora are probably H. ericae. The data significantly extend the known host range and geographical distribution of H. ericae and indicate that the fungus has a global distribution.

AB  - For the first time, a mycological analysis of outdoor urban environment (air, leaves, sealed surfaces) was carried in the cities of subarctic (Murmansk) and temperate (Moscow) climatic zones. The chemical composition of dust deposited on leaves of dominant tree species was taken as an indicator of the air quality. Assessment of the complex impact of factors (climate zone, type of substrate, anthropogenic load) on the quantitative and qualitative parameters of mycobiome was performed. Compared to Moscow, Murmansk was characterized by an increased number and concentrations of pollutants in the deposited dust. The number of culturable airborne fungi in Murmansk was substantially lower than in Moscow. Half of the species belonged to the opportunistic in both cities. Most dangerous opportunistic fungi were absent in the air of recreational zones but present on leaves surface and in road dust in all assessed zones of the cities. Dust chemical composition affected the diversity of fungi species. While the relationship of biological parameters with concentration of potentially toxic metals was generally negative, Cd increased the fraction of opportunistic fungi in road dust. The study revealed an importance of substrate in determining the sensitivity of outdoor mycobiome to pollution and highlighted its biological characteristics sensitive to climate.

AB  - One of the primary current astrobiological goals is to understand the limits of microbial resistance to extraterrestrial conditions. Much attention is paid to ionizing radiation, since it can prevent the preservation and spread of life outside the Earth. The aim of this research was to study the impact of accelerated He ions (150 MeV/n, up to 1 kGy) as a component of the galactic cosmic rays on the black fungusC. antarcticuswhen mixed with Antarctic sandstones-the substratum of its natural habitat-and two Martian regolith simulants, which mimics two different evolutionary stages of Mars. The high dose of 1 kGy was used to assess the effect of dose accumulation in dormant cells within minerals, under long-term irradiation estimated on a geological time scale. The data obtained suggests that viable Earth-like microorganisms can be preserved in the dormant state in the near-surface scenario for approximately 322.000 and 110.000 Earth years within Martian regolith that mimic early and present Mars environmental conditions, respectively. In addition, the results of the study indicate the possibility of maintaining traces within regolith, as demonstrated by the identification of melanin pigments through UltraViolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometric approach.

AB  - We studied the molecular taxonomy and diversity of cultivable rock fungi from Antarctic islands. From 50 rock samples, 386 fungal isolates were obtained and identified as 33 taxa of 20 genera. The genera Cladophialophora, Cladosporium, Cyphellophora, Eichleriella, Paracladophialophora, and Penicillium displayed the highest densities. Ecological diversity indices showed that the fungalassemblages are diverse and rich with low dominance. The genera Cladophialophora, Cladosporium, and Penicillium showed a broad distribution from rocks of the various islands. One hundred and fifty-nine fungi, grown at 37 degrees C, were identified as Penicillium chrysogenum, Fusarium sp., and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. One hundred and three fungi displayed haemolytic activity, 81 produced proteinase, 9 produced phospholipase, and 25 presented dimorphism and a spore diameter <= 4 mu m. The Antarctic Peninsula region appears to be under the effects of global climate changes, which may expose and accelerate the rock's weathering processes, and expose and release cryptic fungi and other microbes, especially those with innate pathogenic potential, previously arrested in rocks. Consequently, these rocks and their particles may represent a vehicle for the dispersal of microbial propagules, including those able to spread pathogens, along, across, and out of Antarctica.

AB  - Antarctica is one of the most suitable locations for the bioprospecting of psychrotrophic fungi, which play a key role in the nutrient cycle and organic material mineralization in cold environments. These actions mainly take place via the production of several cold-active extracellular enzymes. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of filamentous fungi from King George Island (25 De Mayo Island), Antarctica and their ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes at low temperatures. A total of 51 fungal isolates were obtained from 31 samples. Twelve genera were identified, with seven among the Ascomycota (Cadophora, Helotiales, Monographella, Oidodendron, Penicillium, Phialocephala, Phialophora, Phoma and Pseudogymnoascus), one Basidiomycota (Irpex) and two Mucoromycota (Mortierella and Mucor). Monographella lycopodina and Mucor zonatus, not previously reported in Antarctica, were identified. Nine isolates could not be identified to genus level and may represent novel species. Most of the studied fungi were psychrotrophic (76.5%). Nevertheless, only five isolates were able to grow at 35 degrees C, 15 degrees C being the optimal growth temperature for 65% of the fungal isolates. Results from enzyme production at low temperature revealed that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse fungi, which represent potential tools for biotechnological applications in cold regions.

AB  - During investigation of the mycobiota in the Sea of Okhotsk, three new Penicillium species were isolated from subaqueous soils collected in the Sakhalin Gulf and in the northeastern part of the Sakhalin shelf, near the Piltun Bay. According to Raper and Thom's classification, the newly described species P. piltunense, P. ochotense, and P. attenuatum belong to subsection Divaricata. Two analyses were performed to reveal the phylogenetic relationships of the putative new species with other Penicillium species. Phylogenetically, the new species are related to the members of the P. canescens group and share some morphological and physiological features with them. However, they differ in having a larger colony diameter that makes them similar to P. atrovenetum, P. coralligerum, and P. antarcticum. A detailed analysis based on ITS, combined beta-tubulin and calmodulin datasets, and morphological features revealed that the new species formed a distinct group inside the P. atrovenetum subclade. Moreover, P. attenuatum differs from the other two species macro- and micromorphologically and may represent a distinct phylogenetic lineage.

AB  - Fungi with dematiaceous septate hyphae, termed dark septate endophytes (DSE), are common in plant roots, particularly in cold-stressed habitats, but their effects on their host plants remain obscure. Here, we report a study that assessed the effects of six DSE on the growth and nutrient balance of Deschampsia antarctica when plants were supplied with the same amount of nitrogen in organic (casein hydrolysate) or inorganic (ammonium sulphate) form under controlled conditions. After 60 days, the DSE, that had each been isolated from D. antarctica and which analyses of internal transcribed spacer and large subunit regions indicated were similar to members of the Helotiales (Oculimacula yallundae, Mollisia and Tapesia spp.) and unassigned anamorphic ascomycetes, typically had no effect on, or reduced by 33-71%, shoot and root dry weights relative to uninoculated controls when plants had been supplied with nitrogen in inorganic form. In contrast, the DSE usually enhanced shoot and root dry weights by 51-247% when plants had been supplied with organic nitrogen. In the presence of inorganic nitrogen, only sporadic effects of DSE were recorded on shoot and root nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations, whereas in the presence of organic nitrogen, three to six of the DSE isolates increased shoot and root nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Most of the isolates decreased the phosphorus concentrations of shoots and roots when plants had been supplied with nitrogen in organic form. Our data suggest that DSE are able to mineralise peptides and amino acids in the rhizosphere, making nitrogen more freely available to roots.

AB  - At present, reforestation has focused on native forests with anthropogenic intervention and eroded soils. There is interest in producing Nothofagus seedlings which can overcome adverse conditions encountered on reforestation sites. It is necessary to find new fungi that can be utilized as mycorrhizal inoculants and that enable the seedlings to increase their tolerance to adverse conditions. Two ectomycorrhizal strains of the fungus Descolea antarctica (D1 and D2) were cultured at different temperatures, pH levels and the activities of amylases, cellulases, and phosphatases were determined. In greenhouse and nursery trials, the growth responses of inoculated Nothofagus obliqua seedlings were evaluated. D1 and D2 exhibited the highest growth rates at 23 C. Both strains grew at pH levels from 4 to 11. The highest enzymatic activities were registered for amylase (57.2 mg glucose/ml * g of mycelium * hr) and acid phosphatases (58.1 mg p-nitrophenol/ml * g of mycelium * hr) at 37 C, and acid phospatases (1.720 mg p-nitrophenol/ml * g of mycelium * hr) and alkaline phosphatases (1.360 mg p-nitrophenol/ml * g of mycelium * hr) at pH 4 and pH 11, respectively. We conclude that suitable N. obliqua seedlings for use in reforestation were obtained using D2 as inoculant.

AB  - Seedlings of the annual grass Vulpia ciliata ssp. ambigua were grown in sterilized sand with a dark septate root fungus, Phialophora graminicola, which had been isolated from a natural population of the grass. Tiller number and shoot, root and total biomass of seedlings grown with P. graminicola were enhanced relative to uninoculated control plants in a growth room and a glasshouse experiment. Root length of seedlings grown with P. graminicola was significantly increased, but no effects of the fungus on root diameter, number of root hairs or specific root length were recorded. Root nitrogen content and shoot, root and total phosphorus contents of seedlings grown with the fungus were enhanced, but shoot nitrogen concentration of these plants was reduced. Shoot biomass and specific root length of inoculated plants were positively associated with the number of P. graminicola colonies reisolated from roots. These data indicate that P. graminicola acts as a beneficial associate of V. ciliata ssp. ambigua seedlings under controlled conditions.

AB  - Whole genome sequences of four bacterial strains Dietzia maris SST1, Pseudomonas zhaodongensis SST2, Pseudomonas sp. SST3 and Halomonas sulfidaeris SST4, recovered from the South Shetland Trench sediment in Antarctica were analyzed using Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The respective sizes of their genomes (3.88, 4.99, 5.60 and 4.25 Mb) and GC contents (70.0, 60.3, 59.9 and 53.8%) are in agreement with these values of other strains of the species. The bacterial strains displayed promising antimicrobial activity against a number of pathogenic bacterial and fungal species. Whole genomes have been assembled and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been identified using the antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) web platform. Comparative analysis of the genome sequences revealed that the strains host abundant BGCs encoding for terpenes, siderophores, arylpolyene, bacteriocins, and lassopeptides. Furthermore, the key stress-related genes were identified and their distribution provided an insight into how these isolates adapt to key marine environmental conditions. This comprehensive study is a contribution to understanding the nature of life on the deep-sea environments.

AB  - Research on mycorrhizal symbiosis has been slowed by a lack of established study systems. To address this challenge, we have been developing Suillus, a widespread ecologically and economically relevant fungal genus primarily associated with the plant family Pinaceae, into a model system for studying ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations. Over the last decade, we have compiled extensive genomic resources, culture libraries, a phenotype database, and protocols for manipulating Suillus fungi with and without their tree partners. Our efforts have already resulted in a large number of publicly available genomes, transcriptomes, and respective annotations, as well as advances in our understanding of mycorrhizal partner specificity and host communication, fungal and plant nutrition, environmental adaptation, soil nutrient cycling, interspecific competition, and biological invasions. Here, we highlight the most significant recent findings enabled by Suillus, present a suite of protocols for working with the genus, and discuss how Suillus is emerging as an important model to elucidate the ecology and evolution of ECM interactions.

AB  - In understanding stress response mechanisms in fungi, cold stress has received less attention than heat stress. However, cold stress has shown its importance in various research fields. The following study examined the cold stress response of six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolated from various biogeographical regions through a proteomic approach. In total, 2541 proteins were identified with high confidence. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed diversity in the cold stress response pathways for all six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolates, with metabolic and translation-related processes being prominent in most isolates. 25.6% of the proteins with an increase in relative abundance were increased by more than 3.0-fold. There was no link between the geographical origin of the isolates and the cold stress response of Pseudogymnoascus spp. However, one Antarctic isolate, sp3, showed a distinctive cold stress response profile involving increased flavin/riboflavin biosynthesis and methane metabolism. This Antarctic isolate (sp3) was also the only one that showed decreased phospholipid metabolism in cold stress conditions. This work will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cold stress response and adaptation in psychrotolerant soil microfungi, with specific attention to the fungal genus Pseudogymnoascus.

AB  - During the evolution organisms are subjected to the continuous impact of environmental factors. In recent years an increasing number of studies have focused on the physicochemical limits of life on Earth such as temperature, pressure, drought, salt content, pH, heavy metals, etc. Extreme environmental conditions disrupt the most important interactions that support the function and structure of biomolecules. For this reason, organisms inhabiting extreme habitats have recently become of particularly great interest. Although filamentous fungi are an important part of the polar ecosystem, information about their distribution and diversity, as well as their adaptation mechanisms, is insufficient. In the present study, the fungal strain Penicillium griseofulvum isolated from an Antarctic soil sample was used as a study model. The fungal cellular response against short term exposure to low temperature was observed. Our results clearly showed that short-term low temperature exposure caused oxidative stress in fungal cells and resulted in enhanced level of oxidative damaged proteins, accumulation of reserve carbohydrates and increased activity of the antioxidant enzyme defence. Ultrastructural changes in cell morphology were analysed. Different pattern of cell pathology provoked by the application of two stress temperatures was detected. Overall, this study aimed to observe the survival strategy of filamentous fungi in extremely cold habitats, and to acquire new knowledge about the relationship between low temperature and oxidative stress.

AB  - Endolithic growth within rocks is a critical adaptation of microbes living in harsh environments where exposure to extreme temperature, radiation, and desiccation limits the predominant life forms, such as in the ice-free regions of Continental Antarctica. The microbial diversity of the endolithic communities in these areas has been sparsely examined. In this work, diversity and composition of bacterial assemblages in the cryptoendolithic lichen-dominated communities of Victoria Land (Continental Antarctica) were explored using a high-throughput metabarcoding approach, targeting the V4 region of 16S rDNA. Rocks were collected in 12 different localities (from 14 different sites), along a gradient ranging from 1000 to 3300 m a.s.l. and at a sea distance ranging from 29 to 96 km. The results indicate Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are the dominant taxa in all samples and defined a 'core' group of bacterial taxa across all sites. The structure of bacteria communities is correlated with the fungal counterpart and among the environmental parameters considered, altitude was found to influence bacterial biodiversity, while distance from sea had no evident influence.

AB  - A survey was undertaken to determine the extent of Leratiomyces ceres (syn. Stropharia aurantiaca sensu auct.) in soil surrounding apparently isolated occurrences of fungal fruit bodies on woodchip mulch. A molecular detection system with specific primers identified the fungus in the soil below woodchip in which fruit bodies had been noted in the previous year, and also in adjacent soil beyond the mulched area where fruiting had not been observed. The results indicate that L. ceres is widespread in the soil in the survey area, and possible reasons for this finding, and their implication for distribution studies are discussed.

T2  - MYCOPATHOLOGIA
LA  - English
AB  - Endoparasitic and predatory nematophagous fungi are widely distributed throughout the maritime Antarctic, being recorded along the Antarctic Peninsula as far south as 68.degree. S. Fungi were recorded from 71% of the sites examined with Cephalosporium balanoides and Cactylaria gracilis being the commonest recorded endoparasite and predator, respectively. Endoparasites with adhesive and nematode-attracting conidia were more abundant and had a competitive advantage in the Antarctic ecosystem over those parasites requiring their conidia to be ingested before infection could occur. Predators able to form traps spontaneously on germination were far more abundant than those species with a more saprophytic mode of existence, with constricting rings being the most commonly isolated trapping mechanism. Species capturing nematodes by 3-dimensional networks were restricted to bird-associated sites indicating that they are able to grow saprophytically in such organically enriched material. Nematophagous basidiomycetes and phycomycetes were absent except for a single Myzocytium sp. isolated from heated soil.

AB  - Wildfires can negatively affect ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities. However, potential shifts in community structures due to wildfires have rarely been evaluated in the forests of eastern Eurasia, where surface fires are frequent. We investigated EM fungal communities in a Larix gmelinii-dominated forest that burned in 2003 in Zeya, in the Russian Far East. A total of 120 soil samples were collected from burned and adjacent unburned forest sites. The EM fungal root tips were morphotyped and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were obtained for fungal identification. We detected 147 EM fungal operational taxonomic units, and EM fungal richness was 25% lower at the burned site than at the unburned site. EM fungal composition was characterized by the occurrence of disturbance-adapted fungi (Amphinema and Wilcoxina) at the burned site and late-successional fungi (Lactarius, Russula and Cortinarius) at the unburned site. These findings suggest that the EM fungal communities did not recover to pre-fire levels 16 years after the fire. Suillus species were the dominant EM fungi on L. gmelinii, with greater richness and frequency at the burned site. Both Larix and Suillus exhibit adaptive traits to quickly colonize fire-disturbed habitats. Frequent surface fires common to eastern Eurasia are likely to play important roles in maintaining Larix forests, concomitantly with their closely associated EM fungi.

AB  - In the Antarctic environment, yeasts are versatile eukaryotes that have shown wide dispersion in different substrates, producing active enzymes in extreme conditions, but their relevance in biotechnological applications is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the production of extracellular hydrolases by yeasts isolated from Antarctic lichens and molecularly identify these isolates. From a total of 144 isolates on the screening, 109 (76%) produced at least one of the hydrolases tested, with most activities for proteases 59 (41%), cellulases 58 (40%), esterases 57 (39%), lipases 29 (20%), amylases 23 (16%) and pectinases 20 (14%). Among these isolates, 76 were identified, most belonged to the phylum Basidiomycota (n=73) with the dominance of Vishniacozyma victoriae (n=27), Cystobasidium alpinum (n=3), Mrakia niccombsii (n=3), Cystobasidium laryngis (n=2), Bannozyma yamatoana (n=2), Holtermanniella nyarrowii (n=2), and Glaciozyma martinii (n=2). This study is the first one reporting extracellular enzyme production by yeasts isolated from thallus of the species of Antarctic lichens Lecania brialmontii, Polycauliona candelaria, Usnea capillacea, Cladonia metacorallifera, and Polycauliona regalis. With these data, it's possible to confirm lichens as a source of hydrolase-producing yeasts, reinforcing the potential of these microorganisms in bioprospecting studies of catalytic molecules from polar regions that may be useful in promising biotechnological applications.

AB  - Coccomyxa Schmidle (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) is a genus of green microalgae that has worldwide distribution, with representatives found in a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Members of this taxon can be free-living and/or associated with other organisms, establishing different types of relationships (e.g. parasitic, symbiotic). The most frequent organisms forming associations with Coccomyxa are fungi and marine animals, most importantly mussels. Moreover, there is a well-documented association between a Coccomyxa strain and Gingko biloba and some Coccomyxa-like microalgae have been found in the bark of other trees. Here we describe a green algal strain found in association with carnivorous plants of the genus Drosera L. The systematics of Coccomyxa based only on classical methods is problematic, due to the very simple morphology of the genus and its high phenotypic plasticity. Therefore, the microalga associated with Drosera plants was isolated, maintained in culture and subjected to an integrative taxonomy approach, including morphological, ultrastructural and molecular analyses, along with ecological considerations. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the rbcL and 18S rRNA genes and molecular data obtained from the ITS2 spacer, including both sequence and secondary structure analyses, showed that the investigated microorganism belonged to a lineage distinct from those sequenced so far. An accurate taxonomic comparison between the microalga associated with Drosera and each of the species already described for the genus Coccomyxa was also carried out, considering morphology, ultrastructure and ecology. The results as a whole allowed us to erect a new species inside the genus Coccomyxa: Coccomyxa cimbrica K.Sciuto, B.Baldan & I.Moro

AB  - Six strains of black meristematic fungi were isolated from Antarctic soils, gasoline car tanks and from the marine alga Flabellia petiolata. These fungi were characterized by morphological, physiological and phylogenetic analyses. According to the maximum-likelihood analysis reconstructed with ITS and LSU sequences, these strains belonged to the genus Knufia. Knufia obscura sp. nov. (holotype CBS 148926) and Knufia victoriae sp. nov. (holotype CBS 149015) are proposed as two novel species and descriptions of their morphological, physiological and phylogenetic features are presented. Based on the maximum-likelihood analyses, K. obscura was closely related to Knufia hypolithi (99% bootstrap support), while K. victoriae clustered in the Glade of Knufia cryptophialidica and Knufia perfecta (93% bootstrap support). Knufia victoriae. recorded in Antarctic soil samples. had a psychrophilic behaviour, with optimal growth between 10 and 15 degrees C and no growth recorded at 20 degrees C. Knufia obscura, from a gasoline car tank and algae, displayed optimal growth between 20 and 25 degrees C and was more tolerant to salinity than K. victoriae.

AB  - To explore the diversity and application potential of Antarctic microorganisms, 1208 strains bacteria and fungi were isolated from 5 samples collected from the Fildes Peninsula during China's 27th and 31st Antarctic expeditions. By using 16S and ITS sequence similarity alignment, 83 strains bacteria belonging to 20 genera and 30 strains fungi belonging to 7 genera were identified. Among them, 1 strains bacteria and 6 strains fungi showed low sequence similarity to the database, suggesting that they might be novel species. Physiological-biochemical characteristics showed that the identified bacteria could utilize many kinds of carbohydrates and that the identified fungi could produce several kinds of extracellular enzymes. The fungal strain MS-19, identified asAspergillus sydowii, possesses the potential to produce antifungal activity agents based on an activity-guided approach. Further isolation yielded four polyketones: versicone A (1), versicone B (2), 4-methyl-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one (3), and (R)-(+)-sydowic acid (4). It should be noted that1displayed strong activity againstCandida albicans, with an MIC value of 3.91 mu g/mL.

AB  - Background: Antarctica has been successfully colonized by microorganisms despite presenting adverse conditions for life such as low temperatures, high solar radiation, low nutrient availability and dryness. Although these "cold-loving" microorganisms are recognized as primarily responsible for nutrient and organic matter recycling/mineralization, the yeasts, in particular, remain poorly characterized and understood. The aim of this work was to study the yeast microbiota in soil and water samples collected on King George Island.
   Results: A high number of yeast isolates was obtained from 34 soil and 14 water samples. Molecular analyses based on rDNA sequences revealed 22 yeast species belonging to 12 genera, with Mrakia and Cryptococcus genera containing the highest species diversity. The species Sporidiobolus salmonicolor was by far the most ubiquitous, being identified in 24 isolates from 13 different samples. Most of the yeasts were psychrotolerant and ranged widely in their ability to assimilate carbon sources (consuming from 1 to 27 of the 29 carbon sources tested). All species displayed at least 1 of the 8 extracellular enzyme activities tested. Lipase, amylase and esterase activity dominated, while chitinase and xylanase were less common. Two yeasts identified as Leuconeurospora sp. and Dioszegia fristingensis displayed 6 enzyme activities.
   Conclusions: A high diversity of yeasts was isolated in this work including undescribed species and species not previously isolated from the Antarctic region, including Wickerhamomyces anomalus, which has not been isolated from cold regions in general. The diversity of extracellular enzyme activities, and hence the variety of compounds that the yeasts may degrade or transform, suggests an important nutrient recycling role of microorganisms in this region. These yeasts are of potential use in industrial applications requiring high enzyme activities at low temperatures.

AB  - An analysis of the current state of knowledge of symbiotic fungal associations in 'lower' plants is provided Three fungal phyla, the Zygomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, are involved in forming these associations, each producing a distinctive suite of structural features in well-defined groups of 'lower' plants. Among the 'lower' plants only mosses and Equisetum appear to lack one or other of these types of association. The salient features of the symbioses produced by each fungal group are described and the relationships between these associations and those formed by the same or related fungi in 'higher' plants are discussed. Particular consideration is given to the question of the extent to which root-fungus associations in 'lower' plants are analogous to 'mycorrhizas' of 'higher' plants and the need for analysis of the functional attributes of these symbioses is stressed.
   Zygomycetous fungi colonize a wide range of extant lower land plants (hornworts, many hepatics, lycopods, Ophioglossales, Psilotales and Gleicheniaceae), where they often produce structures analogous to those seen in the vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizas of higher plants, which are formed by members of the order Glomales. A preponderance of associations of this kind is in accordance with palaeobotanical and molecular evidence indicating that glomalean fungi produced the archetypal symbioses with the first plants to emerge on to land.
   It is shown, probably for the first time, that glomalean fungi forming typical VA mycorrhiza with a higher plant (Plantago lanceolata) can colonize a thalloid liverwort (Pellia epiphylla), producing arbuscules and vesicles in the hepatic. The extent to which these associations, which are structurally analogous to mycorrhizas, have similar functions remains to be evaluated.
   Ascomycetous associations are found in a relatively small number of families of leafy liverworts. The structural features of the fungal colonization of rhizoids and underground axes of these plants are similar to those seen in mycorrhizal associations of ericaceous plants like Vaccinium. Cross inoculation experiments have confirmed that a typical mycorrhizal endophyte of ericaceous plants, Hymenoscyphus ericae, will form associations in liverworts which are structurally identical to those seen in nature. Again, the functional significance of these associations remains to be examined.
   Some members of the Jungermanniales and Metzgeriales form associations with basidiomycetous fungi. These produce intracellular coils of hyphae, which are similar to the pelotons seen in orchid mycorrhizas, which also involve basidiomycetes. The fungal associates of the autotrophic Aneura and of its heterotrophic relative Cryptothallus mirabilis have been isolated. In the latter case it has been shown that the fungal symbiont is an ectomycorrhizal associate of Betula, suggesting that the apparently obligate nature of the association between the hepatic and Betula in nature is based upon requirement for this particular heterotroph.

AB  - Mt. Erebus, Antarctica, is the southernmost active volcano in the world and harbors diverse geothermally unique ecosystems, including "Subglacial" and "Exposed" features, surrounded by a vast desert of ice and snow. Previous studies, while limited in scope, have highlighted the unique and potentially endemic biota of Mt. Erebus. Here, we provide an amplicon-based biodiversity study across all domains of life and all types of geothermal features, with physicochemical and biological data from 48 samples (39 Exposed and 9 Subglacial) collected through various field seasons. We found potentially high taxonomic novelty among prokaryotes and fungi, supporting past hypotheses of high endemism due to the distinctive and isolated environment; in particular, the large number of taxonomically divergent fungal sequences was surprising. We found that different site types had unique physicochemistry and biota; Exposed sites were warmer than Subglacial (median: 40 degrees C versus 10 degrees C for Exposed and Subglacial, respectively) and tended to have more photosynthetic organisms ( Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta). Subglacial sites had more Actinobacteriota, correlated with greater concentrations of Ca and Mg present. Our results also suggest potential human impacts on these remote, highly significant sites, finding evidence for fungal taxa normally associated with wood decay. In this study, we provide a blueprint for future work aimed at better understanding the novel biota of Mt. Erebus.

AB  - The use of yeasts has been explored as an efficient alternative to fungicide application in the treatment and prevention of post-harvest fruit deterioration. Here, we evaluated the biocontrol abilities of the Antarctic yeast strain Debaryomyces hansenii UFT8244 against the post-harvest phytopathogenic fungi Botrytis cinerea and Rhizopus stolonifer for the protection and preservation of strawberry fruit. The strongest inhibition of germination of B. cinerea (57%) was observed at 0 degrees C, followed by 40% at 25 degrees C. In addition, germ tubes and hyphae of B . cinerea were strongly surrounded and colonized by D. hansenii. . Production of the enzymes beta-1,3-glucanase, chitinase and protease by D. hansenii was detected in the presence of phytopathogenic fungus cell walls. The activity of beta-1,3-glucanase was highest on day 12 of incubation and remained high until day 15. Chitinase and protease activities reached their highest levels on the day 15 of incubation. D. hansenii additionally demonstrated the ability to resist oxidative stress. Our data demonstrated that the main biocontrol mechanisms displayed by D. hansenii were the control of phytopathogenic fungal spore germination, production of antifungal enzymes and resistance to oxidative stress. We conclude that isolate D . hansenii UFT8422 should be further investigated for use at commercial scales at low temperatures.

AB  - Beneficial plant-associated microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes, are key partners that normally improve plant survival under different environmental stresses. It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species.

AB  - Although many advances have been achieved to treat aggressive tumours, cancer remains a leading cause of death and a public health problem worldwide. Among the main approaches for the discovery of new bioactive agents, the prospect of microbial secondary metabolites represents an effective source for the development of drug leads. In this study, we investigated the actinobacterial diversity associated with an endemic Antarctic species, Deschampsia antarctica, by integrated culture-dependent and culture-independent methods and acknowledged this niche as a reservoir of bioactive strains for the production of antitumour compounds. The 16S rRNA-based analysis showed the predominance of the Actinomycetales order, a well-known group of bioactive metabolite producers belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum. Cultivation techniques were applied, and 72 psychrotolerant Actinobacteria strains belonging to the genera Actinoplanes, Arthrobacter, Kribbella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pilimelia, Pseudarthrobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptacidiphilus, Streptomyces and Tsukamurella were identified. The secondary metabolites were screened, and 17 isolates were identified as promising antitumour compound producers. However, the bio-guided assay showed a pronounced antiproliferative activity for the crude extracts of Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1527 and Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1653. The TGI and LC50 values revealed the potential of these natural products to control the proliferation of breast (MCF-7), glioblastoma (U251), lung/non-small (NCI-H460) and kidney (786-0) human cancer cell lines. Cinerubin B and actinomycin V were the predominant compounds identified in Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1527 and Streptomyces sp. CMAA 1653, respectively. Our results suggest that the rhizosphere of D. antarctica represents a prominent reservoir of bioactive actinobacteria strains and reveals it as an important environment for potential antitumour agents.

AB  - Since ice-free areas in Antarctica are predicted to increase by up to 25% before the end of this century, lichens such as the genus Placopsis will be important colonizers of these newly available grounds and will still be present in later successional stages of the lichen community. The main symbionts of Placopsis species are examined for 56 specimens collected from the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica using molecular (fungal and algal nrITS, fungal RPB1, algal rbcL sequences) and morphological methods. The specimens were collected from soils with different deglaciation times. Eight uni-algal photobiont cultures were obtained and analysed from two specimens. Placopsis antarctica and P. contortuplicata proved to be monophyletic and are sister species, only the former producing vegetative diaspores (soredia). Both share the same photobiont pool and are lichenized with two closely related species, Stichococcus antarcticus and S. allas. Two haplotypes of S. antarcticus are restricted to areas deglaciated for more than 5000 years and the volcanic Deception Island indicating a shift in the photobionts of Placopsis in the course of the soil and lichen community development. These photobiont haplotypes exhibit different ecological preferences, possibly leading to adaptation of the symbiotic entity to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Two Gram-variable, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped, endospore-forming bacterial strains, M4-2(T) and M4-1, were isolated from soil samples collected from Oblast Magadan, Russian Far East, as micro-organisms antagonistic to the psychrophilic phytopathogenic fungus Typhula ishikariensis. Strains M4-2(T) and M4-1 were identified as members of the genus Paenibacillus by phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. The strains contained anteiso-C-15:0 as the major fatty acid (63.0-64.7%) and MK-7 as the major isoprenoid quinone. The DNA G+C contents were 42.8 and 41.7 mol%, respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strains M4-2(T) and M4-1 exhibited high similarities with Paenibacillus macquariensis DSM 2(T) (99.5 and 99.7%, respectively) and Paenibacillus antarcticus LMG 22078(T) (99.4 and 99.5%, respectively). There were no clear differences in the phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data between the novel isolates and P. macquariensis DSM 2(T). DNA-DNA hybridization experiments between strain M4-2(T) and P. macquariensis DSM 2(T) and P. antarcticus LMG 22078(T) revealed reassociation values of 56 and 49%, respectively. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed the differences between the new isolates and reference strains that were observed with the DNA-DNA hybridization studies. On the basis of the results described above, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel subspecies of P. macquariensis, Paenibacillus macquariensis subsp. defensor subsp. nov. The type strain is M4-2(T) (=JCM 14954(T)=NCIMB 14397(T)).

AB  - We describe the application of molecular biological techniques to estimate eukaryotic diversity (primarily fungi, algae, and protists) in Antarctic soils across a latitudinal and environmental gradient between approximately 60 and 87degreesS. The data were used to (i) test the hypothesis that diversity would decrease with increasing southerly latitude and environmental severity, as is generally claimed for "higher" faunal and plant groups, and (ii) investigate the level of endemicity displayed in different taxonomic groups. Only limited support was obtained for a systematic decrease in diversity with latitude, and then only at the level of a gross comparison between maritime (Antarctic Peninsula/Scotia Arc) and continental Antarctic sites. While the most southerly continental Antarctic site was three to four times less diverse than all maritime sites, there was no evidence for a trend of decreasing diversity across the entire range of the maritime Antarctic (60 to 72degreesS). Rather, we found the reverse pattern, with highest diversity at sites on Alexander Island (ca. 72degreesS), at the southern limit of the maritime Antarctic. The very limited overlap found between the eukaryotic biota of the different study sites, combined with their generally low relatedness to existing sequence databases, indicates a high level of Antarctic site isolation and possibly endemicity, a pattern not consistent with similar studies on other continents.

TI  - NEMATOPHAGOUS FUNGI FROM THE MARITIME ANTARCTIC - FACTORS AFFECTING DISTRIBUTION
T2  - MYCOPATHOLOGIA
LA  - English
AB  - Soil collected from throughout the maritime antarctic was analyzed to determine the effects of a range of abiotic and biotic soil parameters on the distribution of nematophagous fungi. Endoparasites were far more abundant than predatory fungi due to the greater efficiency of endoparasites in attracting and infecting nematodes, which resulted in a rapid completion of the infection cycle. This allowed endoparasites to colonize even the most exposed soil habitats where conditions favorable for  nematode activity were restricted to only a few hours daily. Seventy-six percent of all endoparasites isolated formed adhesive conidia. The success of this group of endoparasites was due to the ability of the conidia to attract nematodes. Spontaneous trap forming predators were far more abundant than nonspontaneous trap formers. The former have a clear competitive advantage over the latter, as they are able to attract nematodes to the conidia which subsequently germinate and form traps only  when induced by direct chemical stimulation of nematodes. These predators are able to use internal reserves only and so rapidly respond to short periods when the soil is unfrozen and the nematodes are active. Although nematodes were utilized by all the species isolated, many were also capable of using Protozoa and Rotifera as a food source. While endoparasites were capable of infecting Rotifera, they were never observed infecting, or were isolated from soil containing, Protozoa. The  distribution of endoparasites and spontaneous trap forming predators was largely independent of abiotic soil parameters. They were, however, significantly associated with the presence and abundance of suitable prey. These species survive solely on nematodes and therefore do not require prolonged periods of suitable soil conditions in order to produce vegetative mycelium to adsorb nutrients saprophytically from the soil, which is a significant ecological advantage over the other groups of  microfungi found in the Antarctic.

AB  - Located 1140 km from the South American coastline in the South Atlantic Ocean and with an age of 4 million years, Trindade Island is the most recent volcanic component of Brazilian territory. Its original native vegetation has been severely damaged by human influence, in particular through the introduction of exotic grazing animals such as goats. However, since the complete eradication of goats and other feral animals in the late 1990s, the island's vegetation has been recovering, and even some endemic species that had been considered extinct have been rediscovered. In this study, we set out to characterize the contemporary cryptic diversity in soils of the recovering native forest of Trindade Island using metabarcoding by high throughput sequencing (HTS). The sequence diversity obtained was dominated by microorganisms, including three domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) and five kingdoms (Fungi, Metazoa, Protozoa, Chromista, and Viridiplantae). Bacteria were represented by 20 phyla and 116 taxa, with Archaea by only one taxon. Fungi were represented by seven phyla and 250 taxa, Viridiplantae by five phyla and six taxa, Protozoa by five phyla and six taxa, Metazoa by three phyla and four taxa and Chromista by two phyla and two taxa. Even after the considerable anthropogenic impacts and devastation of the island's natural forest, our sequence data reveal the presence of a rich and complex diversity of microorganisms, invertebrates, and plants and provide important baseline biodiversity information that will contribute to ecological restoration efforts on the island.

AB  - The development of cold-active biofertilizers and biopesticides could help improve sustainable agriculture in mountainous regions. With this aim, both psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microorganisms have been prospected in cold regions around the world and tested for their plant-growth promoting (PGP) effects. Interestingly, very little is known about the PGP effects of polar microorganisms in commercial crops. This study aimed at isolating cold-active plant-growth promoting Pseudomonas spp. from Antarctic soils and testing their PGP effects, both in vitro and on wheat (Triticum aestivum). Twenty-five Pseudomonas spp. strains isolated from Antarctic soils at Greenwich Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctic Peninsula) were tested. The isolates grew well at temperatures ranging from 4 to 30 A degrees C and were therefore considered as eury-psychrophiles. The isolates solubilized tri-calcium phosphate at 8 and 16 A degrees C in the presence of different sugars as sole carbon sources. Besides producing indole-acetic acid, siderophores and hydrogen cyanide, several isolates inhibited growth of three plant pathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium ultimum and Phytophtora infestans) by means of both soluble- and volatile-secondary metabolites. Bacterization of T. aestivum seeds with selected isolates significantly enhanced root elongation. Moreover, when grown in sterile soil and in a temperature-controlled growth chamber at 14 +/- 1 A degrees C, inoculated T. aestivum seedlings showed a significant increase in their root- and shoot-lengths compared to untreated controls. Overall, the results suggest that some of these Antarctic Pseudomonas spp. isolates could act as cold-active biofertilizers.

AB  - With the simultaneous growth in interest from the mycological community to discover fungal species and classify them, there is also an important need to assemble all taxonomic information onto common platforms. Fungal classification is facing a rapidly evolving landscape and organizing genera into an appropriate taxonomic hierarchy is central to better structure a unified classification scheme and avoid incorrect taxonomic inferences. With this in mind, the Outlines of Fungi and fungus-like taxa (2020, 2022) were published as an open-source taxonomic scheme to assist mycologists to better understand the taxonomic position of species within the Fungal Kingdom as well as to improve the accuracy and consistency of our taxonomic language. In this paper, the third contribution to the series of Outline of Fungi and fungus-like taxa prepared by the Global Consortium for the Classification of Fungi and fungus-like taxa is published. The former is updated considering our previous reviews and the taxonomic changes based on recent taxonomic work. In addition, it is more comprehensive and derives more input and consensus from a larger number of mycologists worldwide. Apart from listing the position of a particular genus in a taxonomic level, nearly 1000 notes are provided for newly established genera and higher taxa introduced since 2022. The notes section emphasizes on recent findings with corresponding references, discusses background information to support the current taxonomic status and some controversial taxonomic issues are also highlighted. To elicit maximum taxonomic information, notes/taxa are linked to recognized databases such as Index Fungorum, Faces of Fungi, MycoBank and GenBank, Species Fungorum and others. A new feature includes links to Fungalpedia, offering notes in the Compendium of Fungi and fungus-like Organisms. When specific notes are not provided, links are available to webpages and relevant publications for genera or higher taxa to ease data accessibility. Following the recent synonymization of Caulochytriomycota under Chytridiomycota, with Caulochytriomycetes now classified as a class within the latter, based on formally described and currently accepted data, the Fungi comprises 19 Phyla, 83 classes, 1,220 families, 10,685 genera and ca 140,000 species. Of the genera, 39.5% are monotypic and this begs the question whether mycologists split genera unnecessarily or are we going to find other species in these genera as more parts of the world are surveyed? They are 433 speciose genera with more than 50 species. The document also highlights discussion of some important topics including number of genera categorized as incertae sedis status in higher level fungal classification. The number of species at the higher taxonomic level has always been a contentious issue especially when mycologists consider either a lumping or a splitting approach and herein we provide figures. Herein a summary of updates in the outline of Basidiomycota is provided with discussion on whether there are too many genera of Boletales, Ceratobasidiaceae, and speciose genera such as Colletotrichum. Specific case studies deal with Cortinarius, early diverging fungi, Glomeromycota, a diverse early divergent lineage of symbiotic fungi, Eurotiomycetes, marine fungi, Myxomycetes, Phyllosticta, Hymenochaetaceae and Polyporaceae and the longstanding practice of misapplying intercontinental conspecificity.
   The outline will aid to better stabilize fungal taxonomy and serves as a necessary tool for mycologists and other scientists interested in the classification of the Fungi.

AB  - This article provides an outline of the classification of the kingdom Fungi (including fossil fungi. i.e. dispersed spores, mycelia, sporophores, mycorrhizas). We treat 19 phyla of fungi. These are Aphelidiomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiobolomycota, Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Calcarisporiellomycota, Caulochytriomycota, Chytridiomycota, Entomophthoromycota, Entorrhizomycota, Glomeromycota, Kickxellomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Mortierellomycota, Mucoromycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Olpidiomycota, Rozellomycota and Zoopagomycota. The placement of all fungal genera is provided at the class-, order- and family-level. The described number of species per genus is also given. Notes are provided of taxa for which recent changes or disagreements have been presented. Fungus-like taxa that were traditionally treated as fungi are also incorporated in this outline (i.e. Eumycetozoa, Dictyosteliomycetes, Ceratiomyxomycetes and Myxomycetes). Four new taxa are introduced: Amblyosporida ord. nov. Neopereziida ord. nov. and Ovavesiculida ord. nov. in Rozellomycota, and Protosporangiaceae fam. nov. in Dictyosteliomycetes. Two different classifications (in outline section and in discussion) are provided for Glomeromycota and Leotiomycetes based on recent studies. The phylogenetic reconstruction of a four-gene dataset (18S and 28S rRNA, RPB1, RPB2) of 433 taxa is presented, including all currently described orders of fungi.

AB  - Soil food webs of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica are simple. These include primary trophic levels of mosses, algae, cyanobacteria, bacteria, archaea, and fungi, and their protozoan and metazoan consumers (including relatively few species of nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, and microarthropods). These biota are patchily distributed across the landscape, with greatest faunal biodiversity associated with wet soil. Understanding trophic structure is critical to studies of biotic interactions and distribution; yet, McMurdo Dry Valley soil food web structure has been inferred from limited laboratory culturing and microscopic observations. To address this, we measured stable isotope natural abundance ratios of C (C-13/C-12) and N (N-15/N-14) for different metazoan taxa (using whole body biomass) to determine soil food web structure in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Nitrogen isotopes were most useful in differentiating trophic levels because they fractionated predictably at higher trophic levels. Using N-15/N-14, we found that three trophic levels were present in wet soil habitats. While cyanobacterial mats were the primary trophic level, the nematode Plectus murrayi, tardigrade Acutuncus antarcticus, and rotifers composed a secondary trophic level of grazers. Eudorylaimus antarcticus had a N-15/N-14 ratio that was 2-4 parts per thousand higher than that of grazers, indicating that this species is the sole member of a tertiary trophic level. Understanding the trophic positions of soil fauna is critical to predictions of current and future species interactions and their distributions for the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica.

AB  - Five new highly oxygenated alpha-pyrone merosesquiterpenoids, ochraceopones A-E (1-5), together with one new double bond isomer of asteltoxin, isoasteltoxin (6), and two known asteltoxin derivatives, asteltoxin (7) and asteltoxin B (8), were isolated from an Antarctic soil-derived fungus, Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis SCSIO 05702. Their structures were determined through extensive spectroscopic analysis, CD spectra, quantum mechanical calculations, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. Ochraceopones A-D (1-4) are the first examples of alpha-pyrone merosesquiterpenoids possessing a linear tetracyclic carbon skeleton, which has not been previously described. All the isolated compounds were tested for their antiviral, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antitubercular activities. Among these compounds, ochraceopone A (1), isoasteltoxin (6), and asteltoxin (7) exhibited antiviral activities against the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses with IC50 values of >20.0/12.2 +/- 4.10, 0.23 +/- 0.05/0.66 +/- 0.09, and 0.54 +/- 0.06/0.84 +/- 0.02 mu M, respectively. A possible biosynthetic pathway for ochraceopones A-E (1-5) was proposed.

AB  - Glomus kerguelense sp. nov. was isolated from a gravelly mineral soil at Kerguelen Islands, in association with the rhizosphere. of introduced Agrostis stolonifera, Poaceae. This golden yellow spored species is distinguished from other Glomeraceae species by the granular ornamentation of the interior surface of the inner spore wall layer, and by a spongy zone gradually developed within the middle spore wall layer. The isolate differentiated vesicles and arbuscles inside Allium porrum roots and sporulated profusely in pot cultures. Glomus kerguelense is, with G. antarcticum, the second Glomales species described originally from the Antarctic region.

AB  - Oil spillage on the moist coastal soils of the Ross Sea region of Antarctica can impact on populations of microbial heterotrophs in these soils, as determined by viable plate counts and a most probable number technique. Elevated numbers of culturable hy hydrocarbon degraders. bacteria and fungi were detected in surface and subsurface soils from oil-contaminated sites. compared with nearby control sites. Culturable yeasts were not detected in soil from coastal control sites, yet reached > 10(5) organisms g(-1) dry weight in contaminated soils. The presence of hydrocarbons in soils resulted in a shift in the genera of culturable filamentous fungi. Chrysosporium dominated control soils, yet Phialophora was more abundant in oil-contaminated soils. Hydrocarbon degraders are most likely bacteria; however, fungi could play a role in degradation of hydrocarbons or their metabolites. Depleted levels of nitrate detected in some contaminated soils and decreased pH may be the result of growth of hydrocarbon de-graders. Numbers and diversity of culturable microbes from Antarctic soil varied depending on whether a pristine site or a human-impacted (in this case, by fuel spills) site is studied.

AB  - A range of measures of microbial biomass were compared for their effectiveness and internal consistency in characterizing omithogenic soils. Excellent correspondences (r = 0.86-0.94, slope = 0.84-1.12) were found between four measures of total biomass (ATP, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis rate, substrate induced respiration rate and algal + bacterial biomass) when they were compared using regression analysis. Bacterial numbers, estimated from agar plate counts, were found to be highly correlated with microscopy counts and total biomass measurements, though the best-fit relationship was curvilinear rather than linear.
   Measurement of the procaryotic and eucaryotic components of the soil microbiota by selective antibiotic inhibition was found to be unreliable. Other problems were noted when assay units were converted into microbial C using multiplication factors published in the literature. The substrate-induced-respiration method overestimated the bacterial biomass of occupied penguin colony soil by at least 4-fold when the standard conversion factor (1 mg C = 25 mul CO2 h-1) was used. Total biomass was also overestimated when fluorescein-diacetate-hydrolysis rates were converted to microbial C. While all four approaches could provide relative measures of the biomass of the Antarctic microbiota, it was concluded that they should not be employed in isolation but always in parallel when such soils are initially analysed.

T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The linear growth rates of fungal isolates were measured on agar plates at temperatures ranging from 4.degree. to 35.degree. C. Fungi tested included the major fungal colonizers of leaves and litter of the three dominant plant species on subantarctic Macquarie Island, and major fungal species associated with plant and soil communities near Australia''s Casey Station on the Antarctic Continent. All fungi grew at 4.degree. C and were classified as psychrotrophs. Maximum growth rates were recorded at temperatures of 10.degree. to 20.degree. C for 13 of the 15 isolates from Macquarie Island and for all six isolates from Casey. Most of the leaf colonizing fungi from Macquarie Island had optimum growth temperatures of 15.degree. C whereas all litter fungi from Macquarie Island and Casey fungi except Thelebolus microsporus had optimum growth temperatures of 20.degree. C or above. Maximum growth of all species was at temperatures above those normally prevailing in their natural enviroments, with most species growing at 4.degree. C at between 10% and 30% of their maximum rates. However, microclimatic effects have resulted at times in temperatures near their growth optima. The highest growth rates at 4.degree. C were recorded for Phoma spp. 1 and 2, Phoma exigua and Mortierella gamsii from Macquarie Island and Mortierella sp. 1 from Casey. Thelebolus microsporus and sterile sp. G from Casey also grew relatively fast at 4.degree.C, and these species, and Phoma sp. 3 and Phoma exigua from Macquarie Island had the lowest Q-10 values for the temperature range 4.degree. to 15.degree. C.

AB  - Aims Citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri) is a disease of economic importance. Control of this disease includes the use of metallic copper, which is harmful to the environment and human health. Previous studies showed that the crude extract from the fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. LAMAI 2784 isolated from Antarctic soil had in vitro antibacterial action against X. citri. The aim of the present study was to expand the applications of this extract.Methods and results In greenhouse assays, the crude extract was able to reduce bacterial infection on citrus leaves from 1.55 lesions/cm2 (untreated plants) to 0.04 lesions/cm2. Bisdechlorogeodin was identified as the main compound of the bioactive fraction produced by Pseudogymnoascus sp. LAMAI 2784, which inhibited bacterial growth in vitro (IC90 approximate to 156 mu g ml-1) and permeated 80% of X. citri cells, indicating that the membrane is the primary target.Conclusion The present results showed that the bioactive fraction of the extract is mainly composed of the compound bisdechlorogeodin, which is likely responsible for the biological activity against X. citri, and the main mechanism of action is the targeting of the cell membrane. This study indicates that bisdechlorogeodin has valuable potential for the control of X. citri.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementClimate change is predicted to increase drought and soil salinity in Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), posing a significant threat to global food security. Genetic modification of crops to counteract this threat is expensive and has not met with universal support, and alternatives are hence needed to enhance crop production in MTEs. Here, fungal endophytes from the Atacama Desert, High Andes and Antarctica inoculated onto three crops were found to alleviate the negative effects of drought and salinity on plant performance. The study concludes that extremophile endophytes might be used to enhance crop performance as the climate of MTEs changes over future decades.SummaryClimate change will curtail the ability to provide sufficient food for our rapidly expanding population. Improvements to crop production in changing environments, particularly Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), which are increasingly subjected to drought and salinisation, are hence urgently needed. Here, we explored the possibility that fungal endophytes from extreme environments can be used to enhance crop yield, survival and tolerance to environmental stresses.Plants of lettuce, tomato and bell pepper were inoculated with up to six species of endophytic fungi isolated from the Atacama Desert, the High Andes and Antarctica. They were then exposed in the field for up to 120 days in each of three summers to current climatic conditions or to a future climate scenario simulating increased drought and soil salinisation.Compared with uninoculated plants, the yield and survival of inoculated crops were increased by up to two-fold under the future climate scenario. These effects were in part attributable to the improved water balance of inoculated crops exposed to drought and salinisation. The inocula also increased the concentrations of total phenols and proline in leaves and decreased lipid peroxidation when plants were subjected to increased aridity and salinity. A mixed inoculum of six endophytes from the extreme environments conferred the most beneficial effects on crop performance, with a commercially available inoculum having fewer positive effects on crops.We conclude that the inoculation of crops with endophytes from extreme environments may be a viable solution to sustaining crop production in MTEs exposed to rapid climate change.
   Climate change is predicted to increase drought and soil salinity in Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), posing a significant threat to global food security. Genetic modification of crops to counteract this threat is expensive and has not met with universal support, and alternatives are hence needed to enhance crop production in MTEs. Here, fungal endophytes from the Atacama Desert, High Andes and Antarctica inoculated onto three crops were found to alleviate the negative effects of drought and salinity on plant performance. The study concludes that extremophile endophytes might be used to enhance crop performance as the climate of MTEs changes over future decades.image

AB  - Antarctica offers a range of extreme climatic conditions, such as low temperatures, high solar radiation and low nutrient availability, and constitutes one of the harshest environments on Earth. Despite that, it has been successfully colonized by 'cold-loving' fungi, which play a key role in decomposition cycles in cold ecosystems. However, knowledge about the ecological role of yeasts in nutrient or organic matter recycling/mineralization remains highly fragmentary. The aim of this work was to study the yeast microbiota in samples collected on 25 de Mayo/King George Island regarding the scope of their ability to degrade polyphenolic substrates such as lignin and azo dyes. Sixty-one yeast isolates were obtained from 37 samples, including soil, rocks, wood and bones. Molecular analyses based on rDNA sequences revealed that 35 yeasts could be identified at the species level and could be classified in the genera Leucosporidiella, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus, Bullera and Candida. Cryptococcus victoriae was by far the most ubiquitous species. In total, 33% of the yeast isolates examined showed significant activity for dye decolorization, 25% for laccase activity and 38% for ligninolytic activity. Eleven yeasts did not show positive activity in any of the assays performed and no isolates showed positive activity across all tested substrates. A high diversity of yeasts were isolated in this work, possibly including undescribed species and conspicuous Antarctic yeasts, most of them belonging to oligotrophic, slow-growing and metabolically diverse basidiomycetous genera.

AB  - The inactivation of quorum sensing signals, a phenomenon known as quorum quenching, has been described in diverse microorganisms, though it remains almost unexplored in yeasts. Beyond the well-known properties of these microorganisms for the industry or as eukaryotic models, the role of yeasts in soil or in the inner tissues of a plant is largely unknown. In this report, the wider survey of quorum quenching activities in yeasts isolated from Antarctic soil and the inner tissues of sugarcane, a tropical crop, is presented. Results show that, independently of their niche, quorum quenching activities are broadly present in unicellular fungi. Although yeasts showing a broad range of quorum quenching activity are present in the two niches, at the same time specific AHL inactivation profiles can also be found. Furthermore, yeasts from both sampling sites show quorum quenching activities compatible with lactonase-like and acylase-like inactivations of AHLs. Interestingly, the characterization of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa 7Apo1 showed that the presence of a particular AHL does not interfere with the quenching of a second molecule. Evidence suggests that yeasts could play a role in the modulation of the quorum sensing activity of bacteria. The relationship among phylogeny, sampling sites and yeast quorum quenching activities of the isolates is analyzed. (C) 2017 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A comparative study of the bacteria occurring in soils of montane grasslands, montane forests, subalpine forests and alpine tundra habitats was conducted to ascertain the types of bacterial metabolic or enzymatic activities in the soils of these ecosystems. Elevation substantially affected taxa isolated. Amylolytic, cellulolytic and pectinolytic activity was observed in cultured isolates from all areas. Proteolytic activity was not observed in isolates from alpine tundra but was observed in cultures isoalted from all other areas. Microbial population sizes remained constant with increased elevation but organismic diversity decreased. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria were isolated from all ecosystems studied. Free-living N-fixing organisms were isolated in large numbers from all areas except the alpine tundra. Rapid degradation of cellulose seems to be the result of a cooperative effect between bacteria and fungi in alpine tundra soils.

AB  - Knowledge of the relationships and thus the classification of fungi, has developed rapidly with increasingly widespread use of molecular techniques, over the past 10-15 years, and continues to accelerate. Several genera have been found to be polyphyletic, and their generic concepts have subsequently been emended. New names have thus been introduced for species which are phylogenetically distinct from the type species of particular genera. The ending of the separate naming of morphs of the same species in 2011, has also caused changes in fungal generic names. In order to facilitate access to all important changes, it was desirable to compile these in a single document. The present article provides a list of generic names of Ascomycota (approximately 6500 accepted names published to the end of 2016), including those which are lichen-forming. Notes and summaries of the changes since the last edition of 'Ainsworth & Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi' in 2008 are provided. The notes include the number of accepted species, classification, type species (with location of the type material), culture availability, life-styles, distribution, and selected publications that have appeared since 2008. This work is intended to provide the foundation for updating the ascomycete component of the "Without prejudice list of generic names of Fungi'' published in 2013, which will be developed into a list of protected generic names. This will be subjected to the XIXth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen in July 2017 agreeing to a modification in the rules relating to protected lists, and scrutiny by procedures determined by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (NCF). The previously invalidly published generic names Barriopsis, Collophora (as Collophorina), Cryomyces, Dematiopleospora, Heterospora (as Heterosporicola), Lithophila, Palmomyces (as Palmaria) and Saxomyces are validated, as are two previously invalid family names, Bartaliniaceae and Wiesneriomycetaceae. Four species of Lalaria, which were invalidly published are transferred to Taphrina and validated as new combinations. Catenomycopsis Tibell & Constant. is reduced under Chaenothecopsis Vain., while Dichomera Cooke is reduced under Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not. (Art. 59).

AB  - In cold environments, biodegradation of organic pollutants and heavy metal bio-conversion requires the activity of cold-adapted or cold-tolerant microorganisms. In this work, the ability to utilize phenol, methanol and n-hexadecane as C source, the tolerance to different heavy metals and growth from 5 to 30 degrees C were evaluated in cold-adapted yeasts isolated from Antarctica. Fifty-nine percent of the yeasts were classified as psychrotolerant as they could grow in all the range of temperature tested, while the other 41% were classified as psychrophilic as they only grew below 25 degrees C. In the assimilation tests, 32, 78, and 13% of the yeasts could utilize phenol, n-hexadecane, and methanol as C source, respectively, but only 6% could assimilate the three C sources evaluated. In relation to heavy metals ions, 55, 68, and 80% were tolerant to 1 mM of Cr(VI), Cd(II), and Cu(II), respectively. Approximately a half of the isolates tolerated all of them. Most of the selected yeasts belong to genera previously reported as common for Antarctic soils, but several other genera were also isolated, which contribute to the knowledge of this cold environment mycodiversity. The tolerance to heavy metals of the phenol-degrading cold-adapted yeasts illustrated that the strains could be valuable as inoculant for cold wastewater treatment in extremely cold environments.

AB  - As belonging to one of the most isolated continents on our planet, the microbial composition of different environments in Antarctica could hold a plethora of undiscovered species with the potential for biotechnological applications. This manuscript delineates our discoveries after an expedition to the Bulgarian Antarctic Base "St. Kliment Ohridski" situated on Livingston Island, Antarctica. Amplicon-based metagenomics targeting the 16S rRNA genes and ITS2 region were employed to assess the metagenomes of the bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities across diverse sites within and proximal to the research station. The predominant bacterial assemblages identified included Oxyphotobacteria, Bacteroidia, Gammaprotobacteria, and Alphaprotobacteria. A substantial proportion of cyanobacteria reads were attributed to a singular uncultured taxon within the family Leptolyngbyaceae. The bacterial profile of a lagoon near the base exhibited indications of penguin activity, characterized by a higher abundance of Clostridia, similar to lithotelm samples from Hannah Pt. Although most fungal reads in the samples could not be identified at the species level, noteworthy genera, namely Betamyces and Tetracladium, were identified. Archaeal abundance was negligible, with prevalent groups including Woesearchaeales, Nitrosarchaeum, Candidatus Nitrosopumilus, and Marine Group II.

AB  - Climatic change is pointed as one of the major challenges for global food security. Based on current models of climate change, reduction in precipitations and in turn, increase in the soil salinity will be a sharp constraint for crops productivity worldwide. In this context, root fungi appear as a new strategy to improve plant ecophysiological performance and crop yield under abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the two fungal endophytes Penicillium brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum isolated from Antarctic plants on nutrients and Na+ contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency, yield and survival in tomato and lettuce, facing salinity stress conditions. Inoculation of plant roots with fungal endophytes resulted in greater fresh and dry biomass production, and an enhanced survival rate under salt conditions. Inoculation of plants with the fungal endophytes was related with a higher up/down-regulation of ion homeostasis by enhanced expression of the NHX1 gene. The two endophytes diminished the effects of salt stress in tomato and lettuce, provoked a higher efficiency in photosynthetic energy production and an improved sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles is suggested by the upregulating of the expression of vacuolar NHX1 Na+/H+ antiporters. Promoting plant-beneficial interactions with root symbionts appears to be an environmentally friendly strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change variables on crop production.

AB  - Three new species of Hyphomycetes have been found recently in the Antarctic Continent, growing on rhizosphere soil of Colobanthus quitensis (Kunth) Bartl. (Caryophyllaceae) and Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Gramineae). The new species here proposed are: Acrodontium antarcticum nov. sp., Chalara antarctica nov. sp. and Phialophora dancoii nov. sp. These new species were found during the "Campana Antartica Argentina de verano 1989" in Danco Coast, Base Primavera (64.degree. 10''S, 60.degree. 57''W). The same locality is indicated in a map by Gamundi and Spinedi (1987). The fungal isolation was carried out using the soil washing technique (Parkinson and Williams, 1961).

AB  - Bacteria associated with plants colonizing extreme environments in Chile (Atacama and Antarctic Desert soils) provide a model to study plant growth-promoting mechanisms that can be useful to improve the growth of crops such as Chenopodium quinoa Wild. (Amaranthaceae) growing under severe environmental conditions. This study aimed to determine the tolerance of extremophile rhizobacteria to multiple metal(loid)s and evaluate the effects of formulated consortia in seed germination and growth-promotion of C. quinoa. In our work, five rhizobacteria were isolated and classified into the bacteria genera Streptomyces, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. The five bacteria showed optimum growth at 26 degrees C, pH 6, and 1% NaCl. In addition, the isolated were resistant to arsenic, manganese, zinc, copper, chromium and showed plant growth-promoting traits, including indole acetic acid production, siderophores production, phosphate solubilization, ACC deaminase activity, and ammonia production. According to compatibility tests, three bacterial consortia were formulated: i) consortium A (Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. (T1B41)); ii) consortium B (Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. (B2B24)); and iii) consortium C (Streptomyces sp., Bacillus sp. (B2B24) and Bacillus sp. (T3B45)). In vitro antagonism against phytopathogenic fungi showed that Bacillus sp. (B2B24) and Bacillus sp. (T3B45) have a significant level of antagonism (up to 18.7 and 6.8%, respectively) and consortia were the most effective against B. cinerea (up to 100%). Consortia B and C significantly improved the germination rate (%) of C. quinoa seeds (86 +/- 3.3 and 77 +/- 1.7, respectively) and the number of leaves, wet stem weight, length stem length, wet root weight, and root diameter in the presence of metal(loid)s. Our results showed that rhizobacterial consortia based on extremophile microorganisms can enhance the growth of C. quinoa seedlings under metal(loid) stress, demonstrating beneficial characteristics that may be key in the early stages of development.

AB  - L-asparaginase (L-asparagine aminohydrolase, E.C. 3.5.1.1, ASNase) is an enzyme that is used primarily for the production of anti-neoplastic to treat Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Current formulations of the enzyme are highly bacterial in nature which have resulted in adverse reactions. The current paper focusses on production of glutaminase and urease free ASNase in a laboratory scale bioreactor using two fungal species and their efficiency in the scaling up process. The isolated species are Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 and Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1 isolated from wheat bran and Antarctic moss respectively. The experiments were conducted under different conditions known as initial, optimized and immobilized. Enzyme activity at these conditions for Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 were found to be 10.85, 13.56, 17.18 U mL(-1) respectively and for Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1 were found to be 13.97, 19.53, 21.98 U mL(-1) respectively in laboratory scale. The consistency of the scale-up data from the shake flask level to the laboratory scale level was found to be greater than 90% efficiency. It was also observed that aeration condition had an impact on the enzyme production with maximum enzyme activity of 13.48 U mL(-1) for the Rhizopus microsporus IBBL-2 and 19.95 U mL(-1) for Trichosporon asahii IBBLA1 being reported at an aeration rate of 1 Lpm. The above results proved that laboratory scale production of ASNase has shown consistency and efficiency with respect to the flask-scale studies.

AB  - Worldwide glaciers are annually retreating due to global overheating and this phenomenon determines the potential lost of microbial diversity represented by psychrophilic microbial population sharing these peculiar habitats. In this context, yeast strains, all unable to grow above 20A degrees C, consisting of 42 strains from Antarctic soil and 14 strains isolated from Alpine Glacier, were isolated and grouped together based on similar morphological and physiological characteristics. Sequences of the D1/D2 and ITS regions of the ribosomal DNA confirmed the previous analyses and demonstrated that the strains belong to unknown species. Three new species are proposed: Mrakia robertii sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8912), Mrakia blollopis sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8921) and a related anamorphic species Mrakiella niccombsii sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8917). Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region revealed that the new proposed species were closely related to each other within the Mrakia clade in the order Cystofilobasidiales, class Tremellomycetes. The Mrakia clade now contains 8 sub-clades. Teliospores were observed in all strains except CBS 8918 and for the Mrakiella niccombsii strains.

AB  - Surfactants are used to enhance the bioavailability of recalcitrant residual petroleum contamination during bioremediation. However, surfactants in some cases inhibit biodegradation, which is often attributed to their toxicity. Herein, we showthat a rhamnolipid biosurfactant likely served as a carbon source and exhibited physiological inhibition on petroleum biodegradation. The addition of biosurfactants in mixed, batch, slurry bioreactors with soils from a petroleum-contaminated site led to a dose-dependent shift in the microbial community with a decrease in diversity and increase in population size and delayed biodegradation. Microbial community analysis indicated the enrichment of Alphaproteobacteria affiliated taxa such as Sphingomonadaceae in systems amended with biosurfactant. The diversitywas significantly lower in systemswith higher doses of biosurfactants compared to systems without biosurfactant. Droplet Digital PCR indicated a 30-90 fold increase in 16S rRNA copy numbers in systemswith higher doses of biosurfactant than control systemswithout surfactant and nutrients, whereas the nutrient amendment alone led to a two-fold increase in population size. Total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis showed that the biodegradation extent was negatively impacted by rhamnolipid at the highest dose compared to lower doses (23% vs. 40%) or without the biosurfactant. Indigenous isolates cultivated from the oil-amended soil exhibited growth on rhamnolipid as a sole carbon source. A novel insight gained is how dose-dependent responses of microbial communities to biosurfactants alter the biodegradation time profile of hydrocarbons. The study highlights the significance ofmicrobial assessment prior to surfactant-mediated bioremediation practices. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recirculation of wood ash from energy production to forest soil improves the sustainability of this energy production form as recycled wood ash contains nutrients that otherwise would be lost at harvest. In addition, wood-ash is beneficial to many soils due to its inherent acid-neutralizing capabilities. However, wood ash has several ecosystem-perturbing effects like increased soil pH and pore water electrical conductivity both known to strongly impact soil bacterial numbers and community composition. Studies investigating soil bacterial community responses to wood ash application remain sparse and the available results are ambiguous and remain at a general taxonomic level. Here we investigate the response of bacterial communities in a spruce forest soil to wood ash addition corresponding to 0, 5, 22, and 167 t wood ash ha(-1). We used culture-based enumerations of general bacteria, Pseudomonas and sporeforming bacteria combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to valuate soil bacterial responses to wood ash application. Results showed that wood ash addition strongly increased soil pH and electrical conductivity. Soil pH increased from acidic through neutral at 22 t ha(-1) to alkaline at 167 t ha(-1). Bacterial numbers significantly increased up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha(-1) followed by significant decrease at 167 t ha(-1) wood ash. The soil bacterial community composition changed after wood ash application with copiotrophic bacteria responding positively up to a wood ash dose of 22 t ha(-1) while the adverse effect was seen for oligotrophic bacteria. Marked changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a wood ash dose of 167 t ha(-1) with a single alkaliphilic genus dominating. Additionally, spore-formers became abundant at an ash dose of 167 t ha(-1) whereas this was not the case at lower ash doses. Lastly, bacterial richness and diversity strongly decreased with increasing amount of wood ash applied. All of the observed bacterial responses can be directly explained by the wood ash induced changes in pH, electrical conductivity and the addition of wood ash inherent nutrients.

AB  - Microfungi were isolated from soils, mosses, algae and lichens in the Windmill Islands region of Antarctica. From a total of 1,228 isolates, 22 genera were identified. The most frequently isolated fungi from mosses were Mycelia sterilia (47% of total isolates), Phoma spp. (18%), Penicillium spp. (11%), Chrysosporium spp. (7%) and Thelebolus microsporus (6%). Mycelia sterilia, Penicillium spp., Mortierella spp., Chrysosporium cf. pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were also frequently isolated from algae. Fungal distribution and diversity were poor in samples of lichens, compared to samples from mosses and algae. The frequency of occurrence of microfungi was most often associated with strong biotic influence. There was a marked increase in fungal diversity in human-disturbed sites. Twelve taxa were restricted to soils from near the Australian Casey Station, suggesting significant introduction of fungi into this environment by human activities. Away from the station, fungal distribution appeared to be related to substrata and nutrient status rather than dispersal opportunities. Suggestions for future research and the need for constant monitoring to clarify the role of human disturbance on Antarctic fungi are discussed.

LA  - English
AB  - The fungal floras of plant communities and mineral soils were determined at locations both close to and away from sites of human activity. Petroleum contaiminated soils and discarded wood which occur near Stations were also studied, the former for bacterial as well as fungal colonization. The fungal floras of uncontaminated natural communities comprised relatively few species, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum and Thelebolus microsporus being the most common, together with Epicoccum nigrum at Mawson. P. herbarum dominated the fungal floras of mosses at Mossell Lake but E. nigrum was also common in Mawson mossbeds. G. pannorum was widespread and colonized a range of different habitats, particularly in the Vestfold Hills. T. microsporus was also widespread particularly at sites frequented by birds and seals. Phialophora fastigiata was common around the Stations, especially Davis Station, in soils including those contaminated with oil and in wood, and is thought to have been introduced with softwood packing crates. A greater range of taxa including Mortierella, Mucor, Penicillium and Cladosporium spp. was recorded from Mawson Station than from other sites, and this was attributed to the effects of human activity. Few fungi but a range of bacteria were isolated from the petroleum contaminated soils. A high percentage of these soils contained bacteria which could utilize hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source. Some of these bacteria showed a strong degradative potential, namely Flavobacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp. and an isolate from the family Enterobacteriaceae. One isolate of Corynebacterium and the Enterobacteriaceae isolate were active hydrocarbon degraders at 1.degree. C. Hormoconis resinae, the imperfect state of Amorphotheca resinae was only isolated from oil spill soils and then only from sites of recent spills. Geomyces pannorum and Thelebolus microsporus were less common in oil contaminated soils than in uncontaminated soils.

AB  - Holocene climate records from northern Europe improve our understanding of important North Atlantic ocean and atmospheric circulation systems to long-term insolation-driven changes, as well as more rapid forcing and feedback mechanisms. Here we assess Holocene climate and environmental changes in northern Norway based on the analysis of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, and plant wax biomarkers from a high latitude ombrotrophic bog. We define the extent and thickness of Hollabattjonnen Bog (0.16 km(2)), which is located 10 km north of Tromso. Several cores were analyzed, including a 5.16-m core that spans the last 9.5 cal ka BP. Vegetation changes from several sites were reconstructed and the distribution and hydrogen isotopic composition (delta D) ofn-alkanes (C-21-C-33) were analyzed. Our data show several distinct climate intervals that primarily indicate changes in bog surface moisture. In the early Holocene (c. 9.5-7.7 cal ka BP), wetter conditions are defined by the presence of wetland sedges and grasses, higher concentrations of mid-chain lengthn-alkanes, and a similarity in delta D values among homologs. A dry mid-Holocene (c. 7.7-3.8 cal ka BP) is inferred from the presence of a heath shrubland, low peat accumulations rates, and significant differences between delta D values of mid- and long-chain lengthn-alkanes. The late Holocene (c. 3.8 cal ka BP-present) is marked by the onset of wetter conditions, lateral bog expansion, and an increase in sedges and grasses. The Hollabattjonnen Bog record is also significant because its margins were an important location for human settlement. We correlate early Holocene environmental conditions with changes in Stone Age structures recently excavated, and we identify the occurrence of coprophilous fungi, such asSporormiellaandSordaria, likely associated with reindeer grazing activity beginning c. 1 cal ka BP. This site therefore provides important regional paleoclimate information as well as context for evaluating local prehistoric human-environment interactions.

AB  - A November-December 1984 expedition to the Socompa Volcano in the Andes (24-degrees-25'S) rediscovered and described six complex autotrophic communities on geothermal warmspots near the summit at 5750 to 6060 m. These complex communities are unique in terms of their isolation, altitude, and biota, and are considered highly fragile. Environmental parameters were measured and standardized germination trials were used as bioassays of microclimate. Observations were performed on two successive ascents at a 7-d interval, with a total of 8 d recorded.
   The communities were composed mainly of mosses and liverworts, but included also algae, fungi, and lichens. In all, 36 taxa of bryophytes and lichens have been recognized in less than 400 m2 of vegetation. The communities formed dense patches of up to 200 m2 on warm soils (22 to 31-degrees-C at -10 cm depth) around steam vents and at cave entrances emitting vapor (9-37-degrees-C). Insects, a bird (Sicalis olivaceus), and a rodent (Phyllotis darwini rupestris) were also present. Air temperatures during the visit fluctuated between -12.1 and +9.0-degrees-C, with a daily mean of -5.5-degrees-C and a relative humidity mean of 78%. Diurnal temperature amplitude near the surface outside warmspots was up to 31-degrees-C at +2 cm and 56-degrees-C at 0 cm. The mean vapor pressure deficit at +60 cm was 1.1 mbar with an absolute maximum of 5.5 mbar. Pan-evaporation registered over 3.5 mm d-1, but soils were moist below the surface gravel and moist up to the surface at warmspots. This characterizes a cold environment with high surface temperature amplitudes and moderate to high moisture. Hundreds of kilometers separate these patches from any possible source of diaspores, at least for most of their components.

AB  - Winter CO, emissions from soil and snow-covered surfaces can represent a significant fraction of the annual carbon cycle in cool-temperate broad-leaved deciduous forests. The sources of this CO2 production are, however, poorly understood. To clarify the role of saprophytic microorganisms in the carbon cycle during the winter (December-April), mass loss rates of organic substrates (leaf litter and cellulose sheets), and microbial activity and fungal biomass in the litter layer of a cool-temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest in Japan were investigated. The mass loss rate of leaves reached 13%, which accounted for 26% of the annual mass loss. Microbial respiration in the leaf litter, measured in the laboratory. was detected even at -2 degrees C. The ergosterol content (an indicator of fungal biomass) of the cellulose sheets increased significantly in the snow-covered season. Seven genera of fungi including Varicosporium elodeae, Epicoccum purpurascens and Cylindrocarpon destructans were isolated from leaf litter collected from under snow cover. Microbial respiration during the winter was estimated based on the relationships between the amount of leaf litter available, the temperature dependency of microbial respiration and the temperature in the litter layer. The 2 microorganisms in the litter layer emitted 31 gCO(2)-C m(-2), which accounts for 38% of the total CO2 efflux during the winter. These results suggest that through soil respiration, microorganisms in the litter layer play an important role in the carbon cycle during the winter. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ice free areas of continental Antarctica are among the coldest and driest environments on Earth, and yet, they support surprisingly diverse and highly adapted microbial communities. Endolithic growth is one of the key adaptations to such extreme environments and often represents the dominant life-form. Despite growing scientific interest, little is known of the mechanisms that influence the assembly of endolithic microbiomes across these harsh environments. Here, we used metagenomics to examine the diversity and assembly of endolithic bacterial communities across Antarctica within different rock types and over a large elevation range. While granite supported richer and more heterogeneous communities than sandstone, elevation had no apparent effect on taxonomic richness, regardless of rock type. Conversely, elevation was clearly associated with turnover in community composition, with the deterministic process of variable selection driving microbial assembly along the elevation gradient. The turnover associated with elevation was modulated by geology, whereby for a given elevation difference, turnover was consistently larger between communities inhabiting different rock types. Overall, selection imposed by elevation and geology appeared stronger than turnover related to other spatially structured environmental drivers. Our findings indicate that at the cold-arid limit of life on Earth, geology and elevation are key determinants of endolithic bacterial heterogeneity. This also suggests that warming temperatures may threaten the persistence of such extreme-adapted organisms.

AB  - The diversity of lichen-associated bacteria from lichen taxa Cetraria, Cladonia, Megaspora, Pseudephebe, Psoroma, and Sphaerophorus was investigated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Physiological characteristics of the cultured bacterial isolates were investigated to understand possible roles in the lichen ecosystem. Proteobacteria (with a relative abundance of 69.7-96.7%) were mostly represented by the order Rhodospirillales. The 117 retrieved isolates were grouped into 35 phylotypes of the phyla Actinobacteria (27), Bacteroidetes (6), Deinococcus-Thermus (1), and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria (53), Betaproteobacteria (18), and Gammaproteobacteria (12)). Hydrolysis of macromolecules such as skim milk, polymer, and (hypo)xanthine, solubilization of inorganic phosphate, production of phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid, and fixation of atmospheric nitrogen were observed in different taxa. The potential phototrophy of the strains of the genus Polymorphobacter which were cultivated from a lichen for the first time was revealed by the presence of genes involved in photosynthesis. Altogether, the physiological characteristics of diverse bacterial taxa from Antarctic lichens are considered to imply significant roles of lichen-associated bacteria to allow lichens to be tolerant or competitive in the harsh Antarctic environment.

AB  - To understand fully the risk of biological invasions, it is necessary to quantify propagule pressure along all introduction pathways. In the Antarctic region, importation of fresh produce is a potentially high risk, but as yet unquantified pathway. To address this knowledge gap, >11,250 fruit and vegetables sent to nine research stations in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands, were examined for associated soil, invertebrates and microbial decomposition. Fifty-one food types were sourced from c. 130 locations dispersed across all six of the Earth's inhabited continents. On average, 12% of food items had soil on their surface, 28% showed microbial infection resulting in rot and more than 56 invertebrates were recorded, mainly from leafy produce. Approximately 30% of identified fungi sampled from infected foods were not recorded previously from within the Antarctic region, although this may reflect limited knowledge of Antarctic fungal diversity. The number of non-native flying invertebrates caught within the Rothera Research Station food storage area was linked closely with the level of fresh food resupply by ship and aircraft. We conclude by presenting practical biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of non-native species introductions to Antarctica associated with fresh foods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are a cold hyperarid polar desert that present extreme challenges to life. Here, we report a culture-independent survey of multidomain microbial biodiversity in McKelvey Valley, a pristine example of the coldest desert on Earth. We demonstrate that life has adapted to form highly-specialized communities in distinct lithic niches occurring concomitantly within this terrain. Endoliths and chasmoliths in sandstone displayed greatest diversity, whereas soil was relatively depauperate and lacked a significant photoautotrophic component, apart from isolated islands of hypolithic cyanobacterial colonization on quartz rocks in soil contact. Communities supported previously unreported polar bacteria and fungi, but archaea were absent from all niches. Lithic community structure did not vary significantly on a landscape scale and stochastic moisture input due to snowmelt resulted in increases in colonization frequency without significantly affecting diversity. The findings show that biodiversity near the cold-arid limit for life is more complex than previously appreciated, but communities lack variability probably due to the high selective pressures of this extreme environment.

AB  - Ambrosia beetles from the scolytine tribe Xyleborini (Curculionidae) are important to the decomposition of woody plant material on every continent except Antarctica. These insects farm fungi on the walls of tunnels they build inside recently dead trees and rely on the fungi for nutrition during all stages of their lives. Such ambrosia fungi rely on the beetles to provide appropriate substrates and environmental conditions for growth. A small minority of xyleborine ambrosia beetle-fungal partnerships cause significant damage to healthy trees. The xyleborine beetle Coptoborus ochromactonus vectors a Fusarium (Hypocreales) fungus that is lethal to balsa (Ochroma pyramidale (Malvaceae)) trees in Ecuador. Although this pathogenic fungus and its associated beetle are not known to be established in the United States, several other non-native ambrosia beetle species are vectors of destructive plant diseases in this country. This fact and the acceleration of trade between South America and the United States demonstrate the importance of understanding fungal plant pathogens before they escape their native ranges. Here we identify the fungi accompanying Coptoborus ambrosia beetles collected in Ecuador. Classification based ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS) sequences revealed the most prevalent fungi associated with Coptoborus are Fusarium sp. and Graphium sp. (Microascales: Microascaceae), which have been confirmed as ambrosia fungi for xyleborine ambrosia beetles, and Clonostsachys sp. (Hypocreales), which is a diverse genus found abundantly in soils and associated with plants. Phylogenetic analyses of the Fusarium strains based on ITS, translation elongation factor (EF1-alpha), and two subunits of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2) identified them as Fusarium sp. AF-9 in the Ambrosia Fusarium Clade (AFC). This Fusarium species was previously associated with a few xyleborine ambrosia beetles, most notably the species complex Euwallacea fornicatus (Eichhoff 1868) (Curculionidae: Scolytinae: Xyleborini). Examination of ITS and EF1-alpha sequences showed a close affinity between the Graphium isolated from Coptoborus spp. and other xyleborine-associated Graphium as well as the soil fungus Graphium basitruncatum. This characterization of ambrosia fungi through DNA sequencing confirms the identity of a putative plant pathogen spread by Coptoborus beetles and expands the documented range of Fusarium and Graphium ambrosia fungi.

AB  - The spatial patterns of plant and soil N-15 and associated processes in the N cycle were investigated at a forest-grassland boundary in northern Mongolia. Needles of Larix sibirica Ledeb. and soils collected from two study areas were analysed to calculate the differences in N-15 between needle and soil (N-15). N-15 showed a clear variation, ranging from -8 parts per thousand in the forest to -2 parts per thousand in the grassland boundary, and corresponded to the accumulation of organic layer. In the forest, the separation of available N produced in the soil with N-15-depleted N uptake by larch and N-15-enriched N immobilization by microorganisms was proposed to cause large N-15, whereas in the grassland boundary, small N-15 was explained by the transport of the most available N into larch. The divergence of available N between larch and microorganisms in the soil, and the accumulation of diverged N in the organic layer control the variation in N-15.

AB  - Soil health is focused on intensively managed (IM) soils (often farmed soils), by-passing extensively managed (EM) soils (range lands, deserts, shrub lands, tundra). High economic value products are generated by IM systems. Many EM lands are of cultural, recreational, scenic, or scientific value. However, and despite the fact that they provide forage for domestic and wild animals, they are not always of high economic value. IM and EM soils are evaluated on the same health scales. The contention herein is all soils formed under soil state conditions under the absence of human interventions are inherently healthy. But a given soil has dynamic properties that determine its management as IM or EM. An EM sagebrush steppe soil may be deemed unhealthy as a result of low organic matter and short growing season. An IM grassland steppe soil is healthy as a result of high organic matter and a long growing season. The sagebrush soil, however, provides habitat for culturally important sage grouse. The grassland soil may provide, when plowed, habitat for economically important soybeans. Soil taxonomies can be used to establish inherent health of undisturbed soils. Determining a soil's dynamic nature is a different construct. Here, four different sets of EM soils were evaluated to showcase their diversity, evaluate levels of health and display their often-unconventional dynamic characteristics. An argument is made that a soil's health, an inherent condition, is not the same as its dynamic condition (potential to produce goods and services). Soil health changes are usually slowly driven by soil state factors but can be dramatically changed by humans. Otherwise, soil health can be viewed as a near constant ecosystem attribute. The dynamic nature of soils change according to needs placed by humans. EM soils may be healthy but lack attention since their dynamic nature is not traditional and often of low economic value. Evaluation of soil health and dynamic value on EM lands is often exacerbated by information absence. Strategies to circumvent this include sampling design, reference sites and standardized ways of EM soil health determination. A case is made that baselines of soil health can be taken from soil surveys, taxonomic names, and soil data from map units, where such information exists. Certified supplementary information is ambiguously available, but may be crucial. Outdoor living laboratories that feature inherent soil health and dynamic soil alternatives may help circumvent information voids.

AB  - Bulk paleosol samples collected from a Middle to Early Miocene moraine in the New Mountain area of the Dry Valleys, Antarctica, yielded Coleoptera exoskeletons and occasional endoskeletons showing considerable diagenetic effects along with several species of bacteria, all lodged in a dry-frozen but salt-rich horizon at shallow depth to the land surface. The till is at the older end of a chronologic sequence of glacial deposits, thought to have been deposited before the transition from wet-based to cold-based ice (similar to 15 Ma), and hence, entirely weathered in contact with the subaerial atmosphere. It is possible, though not absolutely verifiable, that the skeletons date from this early stage of emplacement having undergone modifications whenever light snowmelt occurred or salt concentrations lowered the freezing temperature to maintain water as liquid. Correlation of the Coleoptera species with cultured bacteria in the sample and the likelihood of co-habitation with Beauveria bassiani found in two adjacent, although younger paleosols, leads to new questions about the antiquity of the Coleoptera and the source of N and glucose from chitinase derived from the insects. The skeletons in the 831 section may date close to the oldest preserved chitin (Oligocene) yet found on Earth. While harsh Martian conditions make it seemingly intolerable for complex, multicellular organisms such as insects to exist in the near-surface and subaerially, life within similar cold, dry paleosol microenvironments (Cryosols) of Antarctica point to life potential for the Red Planet, especially when considering the relatively diverse microbe (bacteria and fungi) population.

AB  - The effects of artificial ultraviolet radiation [UVR; 8 W m(-2) ultraviolet-A (UVA), 0.4 W m(-2) ultraviolet-B (UVB)] on photosynthetic performance, growth and the capability to synthesise mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) was investigated in the aeroterrestrial green algae Stichococcus sp. and Chlorella luteoviridis forming biofilms on building facades, and compared with the responses of two green algae, from soil (Myrmecia incisa) and brackish water (Desmodesmus subspicatus). All species exhibited decreasing quantum efficiency (F-v/F-m) after 1-3 days exposure to UVR. After 8-12 days treatment, however, all aeroterrestrial isolates exhibited full recovery under UVA and UVA/B. In contrast, D. subspicatus showed only 80% recovery after treatment with UVB. While Stichococcus sp. and C. luteoviridis exhibited a broad tolerance in growth under all radiation conditions tested, M. incisa showed a significant decrease in growth rate after exposure to UVA and UVA/B. Similarly D. subspicatus grew with a reduced rate under UVA, but UVA/B led to full inhibition. Using HPLC, an UVabsorbing MAA (324 nm-MAA) was identified in Stichococcus sp. and C. luteoviridis. While M. incisa contained a specific 322 nm-MAA, D. subspicatus lacked any trace of such compounds. UV-exposure experiments indicated that all MAA-containing species are capable of synthesizing and accumulating these compounds, thus supporting their function as an UV-sunscreen. All data well explain the conspicuous ecological success of aeroterrestrial green algae in biofilms on facades. Biosynthesis and accumulation of MAAs under UVR seem to result in a reduced UV-sensitivity of growth and photosynthesis, which consequently may enhance survival in the environmentally harsh habitat.

AB  - As Earth's climate warms, soil carbon pools and the microbial communities that process them may change, altering the way in which carbon is recycled in soil. In this study, we used a combination of metagenomics and bacterial cultivation to evaluate the hypothesis that experimentally raising soil temperatures by 5 degrees C for 5, 8, or 20 years increased the potential for temperate forest soil microbial communities to degrade carbohydrates. Warming decreased the proportion of carbohydrate-degrading genes in the organic horizon derived from eukaryotes and increased the fraction of genes in the mineral soil associated with Actinobacteria in all studies. Genes associated with carbohydrate degradation increased in the organic horizon after 5 years of warming but had decreased in the organic horizon after warming the soil continuously for 20 years. However, a greater proportion of the 295 bacteria from 6 phyla (10 classes, 14 orders, and 34 families) isolated from heated plots in the 20-year experiment were able to depolymerize cellulose and xylan than bacterial isolates from control soils. Together, these findings indicate that the enrichment of bacteria capable of degrading carbohydrates could be important for accelerated carbon cycling in a warmer world.

AB  - Soil formation is the result of a complex network of biological as well as chemical and physical processes. The role of soil microbes is of high interest, since they are responsible for most biological transformations and drive the development of stable and labile pools of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and other nutrients, which facilitate the subsequent establishment of plant communities. Forefields of receding glaciers provide unique chronosequences of different soil development stages and are ideal ecosystems to study the interaction of bacteria, fungi and archaea with their abiotic environment. In this review we give insights into the role of microbes for soil development. The results presented are based on studies performed within the Collaborative Research Program DFG SFB/TRR 38 (http://www.tu-cottbus.de/ecosystem) and are supplemented by data from other studies. The review focusses on the microbiology of major steps of soil formation. Special attention is given to the development of nutrient cycles on the formation of biological soil crusts (BSCs) and on the establishment of plant-microbe interactions.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the potential of the non-lignolytic filamentous fungus Penicillium sp. CHY-2, isolated from Antarctic soil, for the biodegradation of eight different aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as octane, decane, dodecane, ethylbenzene, butylbenzene, naphthalene, acenaphthene, and benzo[a] pyrene. Among all the compounds, CHY-2 showed the highest level of degradation for decane (49.0%), followed by butylbenzene (42.0%) and dodecane (33.0%), and lower levels of degradation for naphthalene (15.0%), acenaphthene (10.0%), octane (8.0%), ethylbenzene (4.0%), and benzo[a] pyrene (2.0%) at 20 degrees C. The addition of carbon sources such as glucose (5 g L-1) and Tween-80 (5 g L-1) enhanced decane degradation by about 1.8-fold and 1.61-fold respectively at 20 degrees C. The metabolites produced during the degradation of decane were identified by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore, the enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP) from CHY-2 was purified. MnP was found to consist of monomers with a molecular mass of 36 kDa. The purified MnP had an optimum pH of 5.0 and temperature of 30 degrees C. The K-m and V-max values of MnP towards Mn2+ were 1.31 mu M and 185.19 mu M min(-1) respectively. These results indicated that the strain CHY-2 can be used for the degradation of hydrocarbons and could have promising applications in treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated sites.

AB  - A novel actinomycete, strain W6(T), was isolated from a soil sample of Yunnan Province, China. The bacterium was aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming and Gram-stain-positive. Genetic, phenotypic and chemical properties of the isolate were studied. 16S rRNA gene sequence data suggested that the novel isolate belonged to the genus Friedmanniella and shared 98.6% sequence similarity with Friedmanniella antarctica DSM 11053(T) and Friedmanniella okinawensis DSM 21744(T), the most closely related species. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, and mycolic acids were absent. The main menaquinone was MK-9(H-4) and the predominant fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-15:0. The phospholipid profile contained phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and diphosphatidylglycerol. The DNA G+C content of strain W6(T) was 72 mol%. Strain W6(T) showed 30.0% and 28.5% DNA-DNA relatedness, respectively, to F. antarctica DSM 11053(T) and F. okinawensis DSM 21744(T). The combined genotypic and phenotypic data showed that strain W6(T) should be assigned to the genus Friedmanniella as a representative of a novel species, for which the name Friedmanniella flava sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is W6(T) (=CGMCC 4.6856(T)=JCM 17701(T)).

AB  - Fumarolic activity supports the growth of mat-like photoautotrophic communities near the summit (at 6,051 m) of Socompa Volcano in the arid core of the Andes mountains. These communities are isolated within a barren, high-elevation landscape where sparse vascular plants extend to only 4,600 m. Here, we combine biogeochemical and molecular-phylogenetic approaches to characterize the bacterial and eucaryotic assemblages associated with fumarolic and nonfumarolic grounds on Socompa. Small-subunit rRNA genes were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced from two fumarolic soil samples and two reference soil samples, including the volcanic debris that covers most of the mountain. The nonfumarolic, dry, volcanic soil was similar in nutrient status to the most extreme Antarctic Dry Valley or Atacama Desert soils, hosted relatively limited microbial communities dominated by Actinobacteria and Fungi, and contained no photoautotrophs. In contrast, modest fumarolic inputs were associated with elevated soil moisture and nutrient levels, the presence of chlorophyll a, and C-13-rich soil organic carbon. Moreover, this soil hosted diverse photoautotroph-dominated assemblages that contained novel lineages and exhibited structure and composition comparable to those of a wetland near the base of Socompa ( 3,661-m elevation). Fumarole-associated eucaryotes were particularly diverse, with an abundance of green algal lineages and a novel clade of microarthropods. Our data suggest that volcanic degassing of water and C-13-rich CO2 sustains fumarole-associated primary producers, leading to a complex microbial ecosystem within this otherwise barren landscape. Finally, we found that human activities have likely impacted the fumarolic soils and that fumarole-supported photoautotrophic communities may be exceptionally sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - The cryptic lifestyle of most fungi necessitates molecular identification of the guild in environmental studies. Over the past decades, rapid development and affordability of molecular tools have tremendously improved insights of the fungal diversity in all ecosystems and habitats. Yet, in spite of the progress of molecular methods, knowledge about functional properties of the fungal taxa is vague and interpretation of environmental studies in an ecologically meaningful manner remains challenging. In order to facilitate functional assignments and ecological interpretation of environmental studies we introduce a user friendly traits and character database FungalTraits operating at genus and species hypothesis levels. Combining the information from previous efforts such as FUNGuild and Fun(Fun) together with involvement of expert knowledge, we reannotated 10,210 and 151 fungal and Stramenopila genera, respectively. This resulted in a stand-alone spreadsheet dataset covering 17 lifestyle related traits of fungal and Stramenopila genera, designed for rapid functional assignments of environmental studies. In order to assign the trait states to fungal species hypotheses, the scientific community of experts manually categorised and assigned available trait information to 697,413 fungal ITS sequences. On the basis of those sequences we were able to summarise trait and host information into 92,623 fungal species hypotheses at 1% dissimilarity threshold.

AB  - Antarctic microorganisms have developed different strategies to live in their environments, including modifications to their membrane components to regulate fluidity and the production of photoprotective metabolites such as carotenoids. Three yeast colonies (ANCH01, ANCH06 and ANCH08) were isolated from soil samples collected at King George Island, which according to their rDNA sequence analyses, were determined to be Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. This yeast is of biotechnological interest, because it can synthesize astaxanthin as its main carotenoid, which is a powerful antioxidant pigment used in aquaculture. Then, the aim of this work was to characterize the ANCH isolates at their molecular and phenotypic level. The isolates did not display any differences in their rDNA and COX1 gene nucleotide sequences. However, ANCH01 produces approximately sixfold more astaxanthin than other wild type strains. Moreover, even though ANCH06 and ANCH08 produce astaxanthin, their main carotenoid was beta-carotene. In contrast to other X. dendrorhous strains, the ANCH isolates did not produce mycosporines. Finally, the ANCH isolates had a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids than other wild type strains. In conclusion, the reported X. dendrorhous isolates are phenotypically different from other wild type strains, including characteristics that could make them more resistant and better able to inhabit their original habitat, which may also have biotechnological potential.

AB  - Zoosporic fungi of the phylum Chytridiomycota (chytrids) regularly dominate pelagic fungal communities in freshwater and marine environments. Their lifestyles range from obligate parasites to saprophytes. Yet, linking the scarce available sequence data to specific ecological traits or their host ranges constitutes currently a major challenge. We combined 28 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with targeted isolation and sequencing approaches, along with cross-infection assays and analysis of chytrid infection prevalence to obtain new insights into chytrid diversity, ecology, and seasonal dynamics in a temperate lake. Parasitic phytoplankton-chytrid and saprotrophic pollen-chytrid interactions made up the majority of zoosporic fungal reads. We explicitly demonstrate the recurrent dominance of parasitic chytrids during frequent diatom blooms and saprotrophic chytrids during pollen rains. Distinct temporal dynamics of diatom-specific parasitic clades suggest mechanisms of coexistence based on niche differentiation and competitive strategies. The molecular and ecological information on chytrids generated in this study will aid further exploration of their spatial and temporal distribution patterns worldwide. To fully exploit the power of environmental sequencing for studies on chytrid ecology and evolution, we emphasize the need to intensify current isolation efforts of chytrids and integrate taxonomic and autecological data into long-term studies and experiments.

AB  - Shape and physico-chemical properties of the scissile fatty acid binding sites of six lipases and two serine esterases were analyzed and compared in order to understand the molecular basis of substrate specificity. All eight serine esterases and lipases have similar architecture and catalytic mechanism of ester hydrolysis, but different substrate specificities for the acyl moiety. Lipases and esterases differ in the geometry of their binding sites, lipases have a large, hydrophobic scissile fatty acid binding site, esterases like acetylcholinesterase and bromoperoxidase have a small acyl binding pocket, which fits exactly to their favorite substrates. The lipases were subdivided into three sub-groups: (1) lipases with a hydrophobic, crevice-like binding site located near the protein surface (lipases from Rhizomucor and Rhizopus); (2) lipases with a funnel-like binding site (lipases from Candida antarctica, Pseudomonas and mammalian pancreas and cutinase); and (3) lipases with a tunnel-like binding site (lipase from Candida rugosa). The length of the scissile fatty acid binding site varies considerably among the lipases between 7.8 Angstrom in cutinase and 22 Angstrom in Candida rugosa and Rhizomucor miehei lipase. Location and properties of the scissile fatty acid binding sites of all lipases of known structure were characterized. Our model also identifies the residues which mediate chain length specificity and thus may guide protein engineering of lipases for changed chain length specificity. The model was supported by published experimental data on the chain length specificity profile of various lipases and on mutants of fungal lipases with changed fatty acid chain length specificity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes at low temperature of yeasts isolated from 25 de Mayo island, Antarctica, and to identify those exhibiting one or more of the evaluated enzymatic activities. A total of 105 yeast isolates were obtained from different samples and 66 were identified. They belonged to 12 basidiomycetous and four ascomycetous genera. Most of the isolates were ascribed to the genera Cryptococcus, Mrakia, Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, Gueomyces, Phenoliferia, Leucosporidium, and Pichia. Results from enzymes production at low temperatures revealed that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse cultivable yeasts, which represent potential tools for biotechnological applications. While most the isolates proved to produce 2-4 of the investigated exoenzymes, two of them evidenced the six evaluated enzymatic activities: Pichia caribbica and Guehomyces pullulans, which were characterized as psycrotolerant and psycrophilic, respectively. In addition, P. caribbica could assimilate several n-alkanes and diesel fuel. The enzyme production profile and hydrocarbons assimilation capacity, combined with its high level of biomass production and the extended exponential growth phase make P. caribbica a promising tool for cold environments biotechnological purposes in the field of cold-enzymes production and oil spills bioremediation as well.

AB  - Fluctuations in climate and edaphic factors influence field decomposition rates and preclude a complete understanding of how microbial communities respond to plant litter quality. In contrast, laboratory microcosms isolate the intrinsic effects of litter chemistry and microbial community from extrinsic effects of environmental variation. Used together, these paired approaches provide mechanistic insights to decomposition processes. In order to elucidate the microbial mechanisms underlying how environmental conditions alter the trajectory of decay, we characterized microbial biomass, respiration, enzyme activities, and nutrient dynamics during early (<10% mass loss), mid- (10-40% mass loss), and late (>40% mass loss) decay in parallel field and laboratory litter bag incubations for deciduous tree litters with varying recalcitrance (dogwood < maple < maple-oak mixture < oak). In the field, mass loss was minimal (<10%) over the first 50 days (January February), even for labile litter types, despite above-freezing soil temperatures and adequate moisture during these winter months. In contrast, microcosms displayed high C mineralization rates in the first week. During mid-decay, the labile dogwood and maple litters in the field had higher mass loss per unit enzyme activity than the lab, possibly due to leaching of soluble compounds. Microbial biomass to litter mass (B:C) ratios peaked in the field during late decay, but B:C ratios declined between mid- and late decay in the lab. Thus, microbial biomass did not have a consistent relationship with litter quality between studies. Higher oxidative enzyme activities in oak litters in the field, and higher nitrogen (N) accumulation in the lab microcosms occurred in late decay. We speculate that elevated N suppressed fungal activity and/or biomass in microcosms. Our results suggest that differences in microbial biomass and enzyme dynamics alter the decay trajectory of the same leaf litter under field and lab conditions.

AB  - Little is known about microbial ecosystems of interior Antarctica, if indeed such ecosystems exist. Although considerable research has assessed microorganisms indigenous to coastal regions of Antarctica, particularly their lakes, ponds, and soils, to our knowledge only one characterized bacterium, a strain of Pseudomonas, has been isolated from South Pole ice or snow. Metagenomic community analyses described in this work and elsewhere reveal that a diversity of bacteria exists in inland polar snows, yet attempts to culture and characterize these microbes from this extreme environment have been few to date. In this molecular and culture-dependent investigation of the microbiology of inland Antarctica, we enriched and isolated two new strains of bacteria and one strain of yeast (Fungi) from South Pole snow samples. The bacteria were of the genera Methylobacterium and Sphingomonas, and the yeast grouped with species of Naganishia (class Tremellocytes). In addition to phylogenetic analyses, characterization of these isolates included determinations of cell morphology, growth as a function of temperature, salinity tolerance, and carbon and energy source versatility. All organisms were found to be cold-adapted, and the yeast strain additionally showed considerable halotolerance. These descriptions expand our understanding of the diversity and metabolic activities of snowbound microorganisms of interior Antarctica.

AB  - Various microbial groups are well known to produce a range of extracellular enzymes and other secondary metabolites. However, the occurrence and importance of investment in such activities have received relatively limited attention in studies of Antarctic soil microbiota. Sixty-one yeasts strains were isolated from King George Island, Antarctica which were characterized physiologically and identified at the molecular level using the D1/D2 region of rDNA. Fifty-eight yeasts (belonging to the genera Cryptococcus, Leucosporidiella, Rhodotorula, Guehomyces, Candida, Metschnikowia and Debaryomyces) were screened for extracellular amylolytic, proteolytic, esterasic, pectinolytic, inulolytic xylanolytic and cellulolytic activities at low and moderate temperatures. Esterase activity was the most common enzymatic activity expressed by the yeast isolates regardless the assay temperature and inulinase was the second most common enzymatic activity. No cellulolytic activity was detected. One yeast identified as Guehomyces pullulans (8E) showed significant activity across six of seven enzymes types tested. Twenty-eight yeast isolates were classified as oleaginous, being the isolate 8E the strain that accumulated the highest levels of saponifiable lipids (42 %).

AB  - Four Gram-positive, non-motile, aerobic actinobacteria were isolated from spiders and their webs. Their genetic, phenotypic and chemical properties were studied. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data suggested that the four novel isolates belonged to the genus Friedmanniella. Two strains (FA1(T) and FA2(T)) formed a cluster together with Friedmanniella capsulata and Friedmanniella lacustris and the other two strains (FB1(T) and FB2(T)) formed a cluster together with Friedmanniella antarctica and Friedmanniella spumicola. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-A(2)pm and mycolic acids were absent. Isoprenoid quinones were mainly composed of MK-9(H4), MK-9(H2) and MK-9 and the predominant fatty acids were 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (ai-C-15:0) and 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (i-C-15:0). The major polar lipids were phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol. In addition, strain FA1(T), FB1(T), and FB2(T) contained diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. The DNA G + C contents were: 72 mol%, 73 mol%, 74 mol% and 75 mol% for strains FA1(T), FA2(T), FB1(T), and FB2(T), respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization studies demonstrated that the novel strains showed low relatedness values to F. capsulata, F. lacustris, F. antarctica and F. spumicola. These data support the proposal that strains FA1(T), FA2(T), FB1(T) and FB2(T) represent novel species of the genus Friedmanniella. Therefore, the names Friedmanniella luteola (type strain FA1(T) =DSM 21741(T) =NBRC 104963(T)), Friedmanniella lucida (type strain FA2(T) =DSM 21742(T) =NBRC 104964(T)), Friedmanniella okinawensis (type strain FB1(T) =DSM 21744(T) =NBRC 104966(T)) and Friedmanniella sagamiharensis (type strain FB2(T) =DSM 21743(T) =NBRC 104965(T)) are proposed for these new strains.

AB  - Marine yeasts can occur in a wide range of habitats, including in marine invertebrates, in which they may play important roles; however, investigation of marine yeasts in marine invertebrates is scarce. Therefore, this study aims to explore the diversity of yeasts associated with corals and zoanthids in the Gulf of Thailand. Thirty-three coral and seven zoanthid samples were collected at two sampling sites near Mu and Khram islands. Fifty yeast strains were able to be isolated from 25 of the 40 samples collected. Identification based on sequence analyses of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rRNA gene revealed a higher number of strains in the phylum Basidiomycota (68%) than in the phylum Ascomycota. The ascomycetous yeasts comprised nine known species from four genera (Candida, Meyerozyma, Kodamaea, and Wickerhamomyces), whereas the basidiomycetous yeasts comprised 10 known species from eight genera (Vishniacozyma, Filobasidium, Naganishia, Papiliotrema, Sterigmatomyces, Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, and Rhodosporidiobolus) and one potentially new species. The species with the highest occurrence was Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) ordination, no marked differences were found in the yeast communities from the two sampling sites. The estimation of the expected richness of species was higher than the actual richness of species observed.

AB  - The quantity of industrially polluted waters is increasing everywhere, of which a significant part is occupied by a number of mono- and poly-aromatic compounds. Toxins enter the soil, sewage, and clean water by mixing with or seeping into them from industrial wastewater. By using 18S RNA and ITS sequences, the Penicillium commune AL5 strain that was isolated from Antarctic soil was identified. This study is dedicated to exploring its capacity to metabolize hazardous aromatic compounds. The strain showed very good potential in the degradation of hydroxylated monophenols and possessed exceptional abilities in terms of resorcinol degradation. The strain's ability to metabolize 0.3 g/L of p-cresol at 10 ? is notable. The strain is also capable of metabolizing LMW PAHs (naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene) and eliminating all three tested compounds under 23 ?, respectively, 77.5%, 93.8%, and 75.1%. At 10 ?, the process slowed down, but the degradation of naphthalene continued to be over 50%. The quantity of PAH and a few significant intermediary metabolites were determined using GC-MS analysis. Sequencing of the enzymes phenol hydroxylase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase revealed a close association with the genes and proteins in some fungal strains that can degrade the aromatic compounds examined thus far.

AB  - Recent work examining nematode and tardigrade gut microbiomes has identified species-specific relationships between host and gut community composition. However, only a handful of species from either phylum have been examined. How microbiomes differ among species and what factors contribute to their assembly remains unexplored. Cyanobacterial mats within Antarctic Dry Valley streams host a simple and tractable natural ecosystem of identifiable microinvertebrates to address these questions. We sampled 2 types of coexisting mats (i.e., black and orange) across four spatially isolated streams, hand-picked single individuals of two nematode species (i.e., Eudorylaimus antarcticus and Plectus murrayi) and tardigrades, to examine their gut microbiomes using 16S and 18S rRNA metabarcoding. All gut microbiomes (bacterial and eukaryotic) were significantly less diverse than the mats they were isolated from. In contrast to mats, microinvertebrates' guts were depleted of Cyanobacteria and differentially enriched in taxa of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fungi. Among factors investigated, gut microbiome composition was most influenced by host identity while environmental factors (e.g., mats and streams) were less important. The importance of host identity in predicting gut microbiome composition suggests functional value to the host, similar to other organisms with strong host selected microbiomes.

AB  - Agricultural mulch films made from biodegradable polymers (BP) have been used to decrease the burden of plastic waste recovery and recycling. However, their degradations depend largely on environmental conditions and sometimes do not proceed as desired. Yeast strains of Pseudozyma antarctica often isolated from rice husks were found to secrete an esterase to degrade BP films. Poly-butylene succinate-co-adipate (PBSA) films buried in unsterilized rice husks with 60% (w/w) moisture degraded rapidly compared to that buried in field soil. The type strain of P. antarctica JCM 10317 added as cell suspension onto sterilized rice husks with PBSA film grew rapidly forming filamentous growth on the surface of rice husks and films. BP-degrading enzyme secreted by the growing cells was adsorbed on the surface of film and decomposed the film. Addition of rice husk-derived P. antarctica strains also showed BP film degradation activity in sterilized rice husks. In the light of these findings, we suggest that techniques for disposal of used BPs which combine plastics with unutilized residual plant materials piled at the side of agricultural fields be developed.

AB  - Mats of coenocytic "snow molds" are commonly observed covering the soil and litter of alpine and subalpine areas immediately following snow melt. Here, we describe the phylogenetic placement, growth rates, and metabolic potential of cold-adapted fungi from under-snow mats in the subalpine forests of Colorado. SSU rDNA sequencing revealed that these fungi belong to the zygomycete orders Mucorales and Mortierellales. All of the isolates could grow at temperatures observed under the snow at our sites (0 degrees C and -2 degrees C) but were unable to grow at temperatures above 25 degrees C and were unable to grow anaerobically. Growth rates for these fungi were very high at -2 degrees C, approximately an order of magnitude faster than previously studied cold-tolerant fungi from Antarctic soils. Given the rapid aerobic growth of these fungi at low temperatures, we propose that they are uniquely adapted to take advantage of the flush of nutrient that occurs at the soil-snow interface beneath late winter snow packs. In addition, extracellular enzyme production was relatively high for the Mucorales, but quite low for the Mortierellales, perhaps indicating some niche separation between these fungi beneath the late winter snow pack.

AB  - In 1981, four fungal isolates from hair of the European badger (Meles meles) were examined by Dr Phyllis Stockdale at the Commonwealth Mycological Institute, Kew, and deposited in the UK National Collection of Pathogenic Fungi as an undescribed member of the Trichophyton terrestre complex. The present paper formalizes the complete description of a new ascomycete taxon, Arthroderma olidum following successful recent attempts to re-isolate the same fungus from the soil of Badger holes in South West England. Furthermore, using ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we show that the asexual form of A. olidum is conspecific with the recently described Trichophyton eboreum [1] isolated from a human skin specimen in Germany.

TI  - SIMULATION OF SEASONAL-CHANGES IN MICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF MARITIME ANTARCTIC PEAT
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY

AB  - Seasonal variations in temperature and moisture in moss peat were monitored in the field at Signy Island, Antarctica. When simulated in intact peat cores in vitro after frozen storage, these variations caused changes on O2 uptake which closely reproduced the results for fresh samples. Respiration rate was used as a measure of aerobic decomposer activity. Supplements of sugars indicated the predominance of microbial respiration and its dependence on the availability of dissolved organic C (DOC). Low temperatures of 0.degree. to 1.degree. C were not rate-limiting for respiration in vivo or in vitro, and O2 uptake was detected at -1.degree. C. Repeated peaks of O2-uptake under wet conditions resulting from simulated spring freeze-thaw cycles, and a solitary peak during an autumn simulation, suggested release of DOC substrares from frost-damaged cells. Desiccation, microfaunal predation and microaerophily were thought to contribute to respiratory declines. O2-uptake and CO2-evolution were equivalent in peat beneath Polytrichum sampled in autumn. Peat respiration was not generally proportional to microbial biomass, but saccharolytic yeasts were dominant during the respiratory maximum in spring and correlated with O2-uptake in a mixed culture of indigenous microflora. Yeasts grew exponentially in freeze thaw cycle stimulations but percolated into the peat profile in the field. The basal O2 uptake, which may be attributable to the decomposition of recalcitrant molecules such as cellulose, was lower in simulations of spring than autumn. Although bacterial biomass increased and diversified during summer, the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial contributions to O2-uptake in an incubated homogenate of peat sampled in autumn was 4:1.

AB  - Microbial communities on two churches in Schleswig-Holstein (northern Germany) were characterized using cultural methods as well as light and scanning electron microscopy. Dilution-plate counts of fungi [10(6)/g dry weight (gdw) stone] and heterotrophic bacteria (10(5)/gdw) were as high as those reported for soils. Counts of algae (10(6)/gdw) were somewhat higher than those for soils. Biomass expressed as phospholipid phosphate concentration (PLP; 115-137 nmol PLP/gdw) was nearly 10 times that of Antarctic sandstone, at least twice that in an architectural red sandstone, and approached that found in soils. Amounts of chlorophyll a were higher than those for the Antarctic sandstone (known to contain algae and cyanobacteria) and were at the lower end of the range reported for soils. The high biomass is supported by photosynthetic carbon input, and hypotheses are presented that describe the role of these epi- and endolithic communities in the weathering of their substrata.

AB  - During a survey of carotenogenic yeasts from cold and oligotrophic environments in Patagonia, several yeasts of the genus Dioszegia (Tremellales, Agaricomycotina) were detected, including three strains that could not be assigned to any known taxa. Analyses of internal transcribed spacer and D1/D2 regions of the large subunit rRNA gene showed these strains are conspecific with several other strains found in the Italian Alps and in Antarctica soil. Phylogenetic analyses showed that 19 of these strains represent a novel yeast species of the genus Dioszegia. The name Dioszegia patagonica sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate these strains and CRUB 1147(T) (UFMG 195(T) = CBMAI 1564(T) = DBVPG 10618(T) = CBS 14901(T); MycoBank MB 819782) was designated as the type strain. This Dioszegia species accumulates biotechnologically valuable compounds such as carotenoid pigments and mycosporines.

AB  - An investigation was made into the occurrence and biodiversity of Geodermatophilaceae on 78 samples of altered stone surfaces from 24 monuments and natural stones in the Mediterranean basin; it was found that the total microbial counts ranged between 0 and 10(7) cfu g(-1) dry weight. Members of the Geodermatophilaceae family were isolated from 22 of the 78 samples examined, with the incidence of Geodermatophilaceae colonies in the cultivable population ranging from 1% to 100%. The highest percentage was found in six samples of markedly deteriorated stone. Sixty-five strains randomly isolated from the plates were clustered in six different groups by amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) using five different restriction enzymes. Twenty-five strains, representing all the ARDRA haplotypes, were characterized further by partial sequencing (350-550 bp) of the 16S rDNA and by analysing 76 morphological, metabolic and physiological properties. The strains were associated with three well-separated clusters of the genera Geodermatophilus, Blastococcus and Modestobacter. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequence and ARDRA analysis, only two strains were found to be related to the two reference strains of Geodermatophilus. All the others could be grouped with Blastococcus aggregatus (19 strains) or the Antarctic species Modestobacter multiseptatus (44 strains), suggesting that it is these two groups, rather than Geodermatophilus, that tend to colonize the stone surfaces, and that Modestobacter-like strains are also found in temperate/Mediterranean climates. From the BOX-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data, it can be seen that the Modestobacter-like strains, belonging to the most represented ARDRA haplotype (haplotype B, 34 strains), are very polymorphic and that, over a stone surface, there is a wide genetic diversity at the microsite level.

AB  - In sampling soils to survey dictyostelid cellular slime molds in Alaska we encountered two groups of isolates that have morphologies that differ from any previously described species within their group. We sequenced the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) of selected isolates from the two groups and found sequences from both groups to be distinct from all previously described dictyostelid sequences. Phylogenetic analyses place one novel species in dictyostelid Group 2 and the other in Group 4 (Schaap et al. 2006). In this paper we formally describe as new these two species of cellular slime molds, Dictyostelium ammophilum sp. nov. and Dictyostelium borealesp. nov., based on the combination of morphological and molecular characters.

AB  - Polar glacier forefields offer an unprecedented framework for studying community assembly processes in regions that are geographically and climatically isolated. Through amplicon sequence variant (ASV) inference, we compared the composition and structure of soil bacterial communities from glacier forefields in Iceland and Antarctica to assess overlap between communities and the impact of established cryptogamic covers on the uniqueness of their taxa. These pioneer microbial communities were found to share only 8% of ASVs and each taxonomic group's contribution to the shared ASV data subset was heterogeneous and independent of their relative abundance. Although the presence of ASVs specific to one glacier forefield and/or different cryptogam cover values confirms the existence of habitat specialist bacteria, our data show that the influence of cryptogams on the edaphic bacterial community structure also varied also depending on the taxonomic group. Hence, the establishment of distinct cryptogamic covers is probably not the only factor driving the uniqueness of bacterial communities at both poles. The structure of bacterial communities colonising deglaciated areas seems also conditioned by lineage-specific limitations in their dispersal capacity and/or their establishment and persistence in these isolated and hostile regions.

AB  - Environmental factors influencing the occurrence and community structure of soil yeasts in forests are not well studied. There are few studies dedicated to Southern Hemisphere soil yeasts populations and even fewer focused on temperate forests influenced by volcanic activity. The present work aimed to study the ecology of soil yeast communities from pristine forests influenced by different environmental factors (precipitation, physicochemical properties of soil, tree species, soil region, and season). The survey was performed in 4 northern Patagonian forests: 2 dominated by Nothofagus pumilio and 2 by Nothofagus antarctica. Yeast communities were described with ecological indices and species accumulation curves, and their association with environmental characteristics was assessed using multivariate analysis. Each forest site showed a particular arrangement of species as a result of environmental characteristics, such as dominant plant species, nutrient availability, and climatic characteristics. Cryptococcus podzolicus was most frequently isolated in nutrient-rich soils, Trichosporon porosum dominated cold mountain forests with low nutrient and water availability in soil, and capsulated yeasts such as Cryptococcus phenolicus dominated forest sites with low precipitation. The present work suggests that environmental factors affecting yeast communities may not be the current soil characteristics but the result of complex interactions of factors including natural disturbances like volcanic activity.

AB  - The genus Chodatodesmus belongs to the coccoid representatives of the family Scenedesmaceae with very scarce diagnostic traits. This genus includes two species, C. mucronulatus (the type species of the genus) and C. australis, which differ genetically. Until recently, data on the species diversity of Chodatodesmus and their biogeography were based on the study of a number of isolated strains. Records of the species were limited to the aquatic ecosystems of Turkey, Peru, and Antarctica. Here, we characterized the new strains of Chodatodesmus, IRK-A 290 and 449, from Lake Baikal by combining morphological (LM, SEM, TEM) and molecular phylogenetic (SSU rRNA, ITS, rbcL, and tufA) methods. The studied strains belonged to different species of the genus that were first recorded in Eurasia. The strain IRK-A 290 was referred to C. australis, and IRK-A 449 was described as a new species Chodatodesmus intermedia sp. nov. For the analysis, we also used sequences from soil metagenomes obtained within the project on the global distribution of fungi and deposited in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Chodatodesmus nucleotide sequences were found in soils in different regions of the world. This study showed that the majority of sequences from soil metagenomes refer to C. australis, and several sequences belong to the new phylogenetic clade of Chodatodesmus intermedia sp. nov. Sequences of C. mucronulatus were not detected in soils. The results obtained add to the data on the species diversity, morphology, genetic features, distribution, and occurrence of Chodatodesmus.

AB  - Microbes growing at subzero temperatures encounter numerous growth constraints. However, fungi that inhabit cold environments can grow and decompose organic compounds under subzero temperatures. Thus, understanding the cold-adaptation strategies of fungi under extreme environments is critical for elucidating polar-region ecosystems. Here, I report that two strains of the Antarctic basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia blollopis exhibited distinct growth characteristics under subzero conditions: SK-4 grew efficiently, whereas TKG1-2 did not. I analysed the metabolite responses elicited by cold stress in these two M. blollopis strains by using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. M. blollopis SK-4, which grew well under subzero temperatures, accumulated high levels of TCA-cycle metabolites, lactic acid, aromatic amino acids and polyamines in response to cold shock. Polyamines are recognized to function in cell-growth and developmental processes, and aromatic amino acids are also known to improve cell growth at low temperatures. By contrast, in TKG1-2, which did not grow efficiently, cold stress strongly induced the metabolites of the TCA cycle, but other metabolites were not highly accumulated in the cell. Thus, these differences in metabolite responses could contribute to the distinct abilities of SK-4 and TKG1-2 cells to grow under subzero temperature conditions.

AB  - Amplicon sequencing tools such as metabarcoding are commonly used for thorough characterisation of microbial diversity in natural samples. They mostly rely on the amplification of conserved universal markers, mainly ribosomal genes, allowing the taxonomic assignment of barcodes. However, linking taxonomic classification with functional traits is not straightforward and requires knowledge of each taxonomic group to confidently assign taxa to a given functional trait. Zoosporic parasites are highly diverse and yet understudied, with many undescribed species and host associations. However, they can have important impacts on host populations in natural ecosystems (e.g., controlling harmful algal blooms), as well as on industrial-scale algae production, e.g. aquaculture, causing their collapse or economic losses. Here, we present ParAquaSeq, a curated database of available molecular ribosomal sequences belonging to zoosporic parasites infecting aquatic vascular plants, macroalgae and photosynthetic microorganisms, i.e. microalgae and cyanobacteria. These sequences are aligned with ancillary data and other information currently available, including details on their hosts, occurrence, culture availability and associated bibliography. The database includes 1131 curated sequences from marine, freshwater and industrial or artificial environments, and belonging to 13 different taxonomic groups, including Chytridiomycota, Oomycota, Phytomyxea, and Syndiniophyceae. The curated database will allow a comprehensive analysis of zoosporic parasites in molecular datasets to answer questions related to their occurrence and distribution in natural communities. Especially through meta-analysis, the database serves as a valuable tool for developing effective mitigation and sustainable management strategies in the algae biomass industry, but it will also help to identify knowledge gaps for future research.

AB  - Microbial consortia are a promising alternative to monocultures of genetically modified microorganisms for complex biotransformations. We developed a versatile consortium-based strategy for the direct conversion of lignocellulose to short-chain fatty acids, which included the funneling of the lignocellulosic carbohydrates to lactate as a central intermediate in engineered food chains. A spatial niche enabled in situ cellulolytic enzyme production by an aerobic fungus next to facultative anaerobic lactic acid bacteria and the product-forming anaerobes. Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Veillonella criceti, or Megasphaera elsdenii were integrated into the lactate platform to produce 196 kilograms of butyric acid per metric ton of beechwood. The lactate platform demonstrates the benefits of mixed cultures, such as their modularity and their ability to convert complex substrates into valuable biochemicals.

AB  - The importance of biogeochemical processes in the morphogenic system of periglacial environments has been underestimated for decades. Weathering rind studies help to characterise and quantify biogeochemical weathering over time. Experiments using fungi strains isolated from basaltic boulders allow one to decipher biological weathering. A historical approach using heterochronous moraines provides the opportunity to follow the life of weathering rinds and helps to build a chronology of dominant processes of weathering during the first century of exposure. It appears that exfoliation of weathering rinds, commonly observed on boulders, is the result of a combination of both biogeochemical and physical processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Although viable fungi have been recovered from a wide variety of icy environments, their metabolic capabilities under frozen conditions are still largely unknown. We investigated basidiomycetous yeasts isolated from an Antarctic ice core and showed that after freezing at a relatively slow rate (0.8 degrees C min(-1)), the cells are excluded into veins of liquid at the triple junctions of ice crystals. These strains were capable of reproductive growth at -5 degrees C under liquid conditions. Under frozen conditions, metabolic activity was assessed by measuring rates of [H-3]leucine incorporation into the acid-insoluble macromolecular fraction, which decreased exponentially at temperatures between 15 degrees C and -15 degrees C and was inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Experiments at -5 degrees C under frozen and liquid conditions revealed 2-3 orders of magnitude lower rates of endogenous metabolism in ice, likely due to the high salinity in the liquid fraction of the ice (equivalent of approximate to 1.4 mol l(-1) of NaCl at -5 degrees C). The mesophile Saccharomyces cerevisae also incorporated [H-3]leucine at -5 degrees C and -15 degrees C, indicating that this activity is not exclusive to cold-adapted microorganisms. The ability of yeast cells to incorporate amino acid substrates into macromolecules and remain metabolically active under these conditions has implications for understanding the survival of Eukarya in icy environments.

AB  - Biodiesel has been regarded as a biodegradable and non-polluting fuel. Enzymatic transesterification reaction for manufacturing biodiesel from vegetable oils with alcohol is an attractive approach. However, the cost of enzyme remains a barrier for its industrial implementation. The aim of this research was the screening of lipase-producing microorganisms and the studies of potential lipase-mediated biodiesel production using palm oil as substrate. A total of 360 strains of bacteria, yeasts and fungi were isolated and screened from the samples of oil-contaminated soil and waste water. Among all the screened microbes, the potential lipolytic bacterium, Staphylococcus warneri, unicellular yeast, Candida rugosa and filamentous fungus, Fusarium solani were selected because of their high specific activities. The lipase-producing conditions were subsequently optimized by using palm oil as an inducer and lipase activities were compared for both hydrolytic and synthetic catalysis. C. rugosa lipase, which exhibited the highest potential for catalyzing the biodiesel production, was further purified and immobilized on various hydrophobic supports. The catalysis of transesterification between methanol and palm oil by the C. rugosa immobilized lipases revealed that immobilized lipase from C. rugosa on Sepabeads EC-OD was the most promising for further development as a biocatalyst for the application of enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel synthesis.

AB  - Chitinase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds in chitin, holds significant potential for industrial applications, including biological control, antifungal treatments, and antibiofilm strategies. In this study, chitinase derived from Planomicrobium sp. (PP133202) was immobilized onto a cobalt metal-organic framework (CoMOF), and its properties were extensively analyzed using various biological, chemical, and physical characterization techniques. The microbial source was identified via 16S rRNA sequencing, and enzyme activity was optimized under submerged conditions using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Structural and morphological characterization of the chitinase/Co-MOF complex was conducted through FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD, EDX, and surface area analyses. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were determined to be 42 % and 20 %, respectively. Notably, the immobilized chitinase exhibited a threefold increase in enzymatic activity compared to its free form. Additionally, the chitinase/Co-MOF complex demonstrated enhanced biological control efficacy, effectively inhibiting Tribolium castaneum and multiple pathogenic microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus, and Beauveria bassiana. These findings highlight the potential of chitinase/Co-MOF as a promising agent for antimicrobial and pest control applications.

AB  - This study re-evaluates the classification of the Lulworthiomycetidae based on phylogenetic analyses of 18S, 28S and ITS (internal transcribed spacers and 5.8S) regions of rDNA and protein coding genes (TEF1 alpha, RPB1, RPB2, TUB2, MCM7) along with comprehensive morphological comparisons. Based on the current phylogenetic data we consider the genus Spathulospora as a member of the Lulworthiales, Lulworthiomycetidae, and redundancy of the taxon Spathulosporales. This study confirms Lulworthia as polyphyletic with the characteristic filiform, long ascospores with an end chamber, which is found in many genera: Halazoon, Halophilomyces, Lulwoana, Lulwoidea, Matsusporium, Paralulworthia, Paramoleospora, Rostrupiella, and Sammeyersia. These genera can be distinguished by morphology, their asexual morphs and molecular phylogeny. The Lulworthiomycetidae includes 23 genera and 69 species. One new genus (Lindriella) and eight new species (Hydea mangrovei, Lulworthia norwegica, Matsusporium japonica, Moromyces mangrovis, Paralulworthia lignicola, Rostrupiella longispora, Sammeyersia yanbuensis, S. thailandica) are introduced, with four new combinations.

AB  - A lipase producing strain B1213 isolated from soil was identified as Burkholderia pyrrocinia based on 16S rRNA gene and recA sequeence analysis, making this the first report on the presence of a lipase from B. pyrrocinia. Under an aqueous two-phase purification strategy, which included (ATPE)-ion-exchange chromatography (IEC)-gel and filtration chromatography (GFC), the specific activity of the 35-kDa lipase was determined to be 875.7 U/mg protein. The optimum pH and temperature of this lipase was pH 8.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The lipase retained > 85% activity in isopropanol and acetone at 30 degrees C for 10 mM but the activity was reduced to 10.6% in n-hexane. Mg2+, Al3+, Mn2+, and Fe3+ enhanced lipase activity at both 1 mM and 5 mM concentrations. p-NPP, a long-chain acyl group 4-NP ester, appeared to be a good substrate candidate.

AB  - During the period of early February to early April of 1995, samples for isolation of dictyostelid cellular slime molds were collected from representative examples of all major types of plant communities found on subantarctic Macquarie Island. These included tussock grassland, short grassland, herbfield, fernbrake, mire, and feldmark communities. There are apparently no previous reports of dictyostelids from the south polar region, but Dictyostelium mucoroides was recovered from soil/litter and/ or recovered from soil/litter and/or litter samples collected in tussock grassland, herbfield, and fernbrake communities. Densities were almost invariably low (<50 colony-forming units/g), but one study site yielded 135 colony-forming units/g. The most diverse plant communities on Macquarie are mixed herbfield communities that occur on raised coastal terraces, and the majority of positive samples were collected from these communities. No dictyostelids were recovered from samples collected at higher elevations (generally >200 m) on the main plateau of the island. In general, both frequency of occurrence and density were higher for samples of moist, decomposing litter found around land sometimes still attached to) the bases of such plants as Pleurophyllum hookeri and Stilbocarpa polaris than for samples collected from the soil/litter interface zone.

AB  - The cave microbiota is assumed to be shaped by indoor microclimate, biotic and abiotic factors, which are largely dependent from outside environmental conditions; however, this knowledge is available at local or regional scales only. To address this knowledge gap, we reanalyzed over 1050 bacterial and fungal communities of caves worldwide, and found that outdoor temperature and rainfall play a critical role in explaining differences in microbial diversity patterns of global caves, selecting specific dominant taxa across gradients of growing aridity conditions with arid climate leading to a reduction in total cave microbial diversity. Moreover, we found that fungal (from 186 to 1908 taxa) and bacterial (from 467 to 1619 taxa) diversity increased under temperate-tropical and temperate-continental climatic regions, respectively, highlighting an opposite preference for the two microbial compartments. We hypothesized that outdoor geographical, climatic variables and lithology are critical epistatic drivers in assembling microbial communities and their dominant taxa, whose ecological responses could be useful to predict the fate of these subterranean environments in the context of climate change. Our work elucidates the intimate connection between caves microbiota and surface ecosystems highlighting the sensitivity of cave microbial communities to climatic changes and environmental degradation. This work also provides a natural benchmark for the biogeographic information for caves globally and for protection strategies aiming at conservation of underground environments.

AB  - Background A key component of achieving universal health coverage is ensuring that all populations have access to quality health care. Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 1990 to 2016.
   Methods Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0-100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita.
   Findings In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97.1 (95% UI 95.8-98.1) in Iceland, followed by 96.6 (94.9-97.9) in Norway and 96.1 (94.5-97.3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18.6 (13.1-24.4) in the Central African Republic, 19.0 (14.3-23.7) in Somalia, and 23.4 (20.2-26.8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91.5 (89.1-936) in Beijing to 48.0 (43.4-53.2) in Tibet (a 43.5-point difference), while India saw a 30.8-point disparity, from 64.8 (59.6-68.8) in Goa to 34.0 (30.3-38.1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4.8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20.9-point to 17.0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17.2-point to 20.4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.
   Interpretation GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view and subsequent provision of quality health care for all populations.

AB  - Document recommendation systems for locating relevant literature have mostly relied on methods developed a decade ago. This is largely due to the lack of a large offline gold-standard benchmark of relevant documents that cover a variety of research fields such that newly developed literature search techniques can be compared, improved and translated into practice. To overcome this bottleneck, we have established the RElevant LIterature SearcH consortium consisting of more than 1500 scientists from 84 countries, who have collectively annotated the relevance of over 180 000 PubMed-listed articles with regard to their respective seed (input) article/s. The majority of annotations were contributed by highly experienced, original authors of the seed articles. The collected data cover 76% of all unique PubMed Medical Subject Headings descriptors. No systematic biases were observed across different experience levels, research fields or time spent on annotations. More importantly, annotations of the same document pairs contributed by different scientists were highly concordant. We further show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles, suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture all relevant articles. The established database server located at https://relishdb.ict.griffith.edu.au is freely available for the downloading of annotation data and the blind testing of new methods. We expect that this benchmark will be useful for stimulating the development of new powerful techniques for title and title/abstract-based search engines for relevant articles in biomedical research.
