AB  - This is the first report on abundance and diversity of cultured filamentous fungi and on abundance of yeasts in the sediments of the Laptev and East Siberian seas. A total of 63 isolates of filamentous fungi belonging to 32 morphotypes were obtained from 35 sediment samples. Most morphotypes were represented by single colonies in individual samples; the most frequently occurring species were Pseudeurotiumzonatum, Pseudogymnoascuspannorum, and Cordycepsfarinos & acy;. In both seas, the abundance of filamentous fungi (up to 12 colonies per 1 g wet sediment) was lower than that of yeasts (up to 68 colonies per 1 g wet sediment). In the Laptev Sea, yeast abundance was low at all stations, while in the East Siberian Sea higher values were found at near-estuarine stations.

AB  - Despite feather fungi being an important component of the Arctic fungal flora, their ecological role and diversity are not fully known. In the current study, fungal cultures were isolated from feathers (barnacle goose, common eider, and glaucous gull) collected in the Ny-lesund region, Svalbard. Isolates were identified by ITS region sequences, which include the ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S rRNA. The result showed culturable yeast and filamentous fungi belonging to three classes: Ascomycota (Pyrenochaetopsis pratorum, Cladosporium herbarum, Thelebolus microsporus, Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium commune, and Venturia sp.), Basidiomycota (Mrakia blollopis and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa), and Zygomycota (Mucor flavus). Most of the fungal isolates appeared to be cold-tolerant, and about 60 % of the isolates showed keratinase activity. The reasonably low fungal diversity colonizing feathers indicates that the birds of Svalbard are casual carriers of fungi which may result in a negligible impact on their health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of fungal communities present on the feathers of birds in the high Arctic.

T2  - FUNGAL BIOLOGY REVIEWS
AB  - Fungi are widely distributed on our planet, including in extremely harsh habitats, such as the polar regions. The extreme conditions of those habitats limit the number of organisms capable of living there, but some fungi are adapted to the polar conditions and play essential roles in nutrient cycling. However, knowledge about their diversity, distribution, and functioning is fragmented, and approaches used to study them are diverse, often yielding difficult-to-compare results. We present maps with locations of mycological studies in the Arctic and Antarctica, as well as a list of mycelial fungi found on various terrestrial substrates through cultivation on nutrient media and/or molecular methods. These fungi were identified to the species level based on morphological-cultural features or gene-sequence analysis. Analysis of the methods applied to study fungi in different substrates shows that a combination of multiple methods is optimal to study species composition. The taxonomic affiliation of the identified species to different fungal divisions is largely determined by habitat conditions and research methods. The largest number of species belongs to the divisions Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The predominant ecological groups were saprotrophic and symbiotic fungi. The majority of 1324 discovered fungal species are known as cosmopolitan species. Approximately one-fifth of the fungi were identical between the Arctic and Antarctica, only a few species are known to be endemic to Antarctica or Arctic, and there are 1-6 identified bipolar species. Claims of endemism of polar-region fungi are relatively weakly supported.

AB  - The basidiomycetous yeast, Glaciozyma antarctica, was isolated from various terrestrial materials collected from the Soya coast, East Antarctica, and formed frost-columnar colonies on agar plates frozen at -1 degrees C. Thawed colonies were highly viscous, indicating that the yeast produced a large number of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). G. antarctica was then cultured on frozen media containing red food coloring to observe the dynamics of solutes in unfrozen water; pigments accumulated in frozen yeast colonies, indicating that solutes were concentrated in unfrozen water of yeast colonies. Moreover, the yeast produced a small quantity of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) which inhibited ice crystal growth. Solutes in unfrozen water were considered to accumulate in the pore of frozen colonies. The extracellular IBPs may have held an unfrozen state of medium water after accumulation in the frost-columnar colony.

AB  - Root and soil samples from 13 collecting sites located in the Canadian High Arctic were harvested between July 18 and 29, 1991, and surveyed for root colonization and spore populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Grasses of the genus Festuca (Festuca brachyphylla Schult. & Schult., Festuca baffinensis Polunin, and Festuca hyperborea Holmen ex Frederiksen) served as target plants. Of the 197 plant-root systems and soil rhizospheres examined, 28% were associated with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Roots of both F: brachyphylla and F: baffinensis were colonized, while none were detected in F. hyperborea root specimens. Five arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species were extracted from indigenous soils. The most frequent and abundant species was Glomus mosseae (Nicol. & Gerd.) Gerdemann & Trappe, which was isolated from 8 of the 13 sites sampled. Other Glomales species in Arctic soils were Glomus macrocarpum Tul & Tul., Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxter sensu Gerd.) Gerd. & Trappe emend. Walker & Koske, and two other unidentified Glomus species. Trap cultures of the indigenous soil with leek (Allium porrum L.) plants confirmed the identity of the species previously identified from original soil and allowed the detection of an additional species, Glomus aggregatum Schenck. & Smith. The novelty of these observations and the relationship between plant mycorrhizal status, fungal species, and soil disturbance are discussed.

AB  - The effect of hydrocarbon pollution on the fungal communities of littoral sediments of the cold-water White and Barents seas was investigated. The samples were collected at locations with different levels of pollution with oil products, from ports to relatively undisturbed areas. Using the diesel fuel-containing medium resulted in detection of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi in almost all studied samples, although in all cases they were less diverse than sugar-degrading fungi. In this relatively small group, Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium brevicompactum were the most common organisms. Fungal communities isolated on a sugar-containing medium exhibited higher diversity and abundance, with being the most common sugar degraders. The major factors affecting the structure of the fungal communities were the percentage of hydrocarbons in the total mass of organic carbon in the samples in the case of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi and location, for sugar degraders. In the experiment, the highest hydrocarbon-degrading activity was shown for Penicillium chrysogenum (the loss of residual hydrocarbons was 77.4%), Cadophora fastigiata (72%), and Tolypocladium inflatum (67.2%).

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Yeasts peculiar to the Dry Valleys of Antarctica can be recovered by allowing them to become enate (grow out) from soil particles. The enation system weas successful in liquid medium E-1 shaken at 160 rpm in a 10.degree. C water bath. Samples were spread on a richer medium, 2 MC. This system also allowed the isolation of typical soil yeasts from Colorado [USA] soils and of cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, filamentous fungi and chlorophyta. Marked inhibitory effects of conventional yeast media account for the failure of previous investigators to isolate these Antarctic yeasts. Their abundance remains unknown, since E-1 and 2 MC also have some inhibitory effects.

Certain isolates were characterized to genus and species; it is suggested that they are of water and/or soil origin. Refrigeration is necessary in arctic regions, especially during the summer, as exemplified by a food poisoning outbreak occurring when proper precautions were not observed.

AB  - Lichen symbiosis is a successful nutritional strategy that drives lichen distributions in high Arctic ecosystems. However, the in situ effects of fungal partners (mycobionts) on water availability for the photosynthetic partners (photobionts) and their necessity for survival remain unclear. We investigated the factors creating differences in water availability in high Arctic lichen assemblages using observational and experimental analyses of substrates and thallus morphology in the high Arctic, near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (79 degrees N) during the snow-free season. We used five lichen species found on five substrate types: moss litter, vascular plant litter, mixed litter, biological soil crust (BSC) and gravel. BSC had significantly higher water content than the other substrates; although it had high levels of surface evaporation, BSC took up more ground water. Moreover, the structure of BSC supported greater water retention than the four other substrates in our study, providing the moistest environment for lichens. In fact, 60 % of the surface area of the crustose lichen Ochrolechia frigida, which was mainly distributed on BSC, was in contact with the substrate. In contrast, the four fruticose lichens had larger surface areas than Och frig and roughly 90 % air exposure. Initial rates of absorption and evaporation increased with greater thallus surface area, suggesting that water availability for photobionts is strongly affected by both morphological characteristics and substrate water properties, both of which depend on mycobionts. We conclude that lichens show preferences for both morphologies and substrates that promote autotrophic nutrition in the water-limited glacier foreland of the high Arctic region.

Among these strains Penicillium cyclopium 1, the most effective for production of catalase, was selected by the method of test-tube microculture. The time course of growth and catalase production by this strain showed the intracellular activity of this enzyme to be about 3-fold higher than its extracellular level. Some properties of crude catalase preparation, isolated from postculture liquids by lyophilization, were also examined. Catalase activity showed its maximum at 15 degreesC, indicating adaptation of the enzyme to lower temperatures of the arctic environment.

AB  - The recovery of culturable microorganisms from ancient materials, ranging from a few thousand to several million years old, has generated interest in the long-term survival capabilities of micrororganisms. We report the occurrence of such paleobes for the first time from a deep-sea sediment core obtained from a depth of 5904 m from the Chagos trench in the Indian Ocean. Culturable fungi, direct counts of bacteria, age of the sediments based on the radiolarian assemblage, total organic carbon, Eh and CaCO3 were determined in these sediments. Culturable fungi were obtained from subsections up to 370 cm depth. The age of the sediments from which fungi were isolated was estimated to range from>0.18 to 0.43 million years (Ma), being the oldest recorded age for recovery of culturable fungi. Colony forming units of fungi ranged from 69 to 2493 g(-1) dry weight sediment with a maximum abundance recorded at 160 cm depth of the core, corresponding to similar to0.18 Ma. Bacterial numbers in the core showed oscillations corresponding to cycles of approximately 100 ka (kilo years). The fungi comprised non-sporulating forms and a sporulating form identified to be Aspergillus sydowii. Germination of spores of A. sydowii at 100, 300 and 500 bar hydrostatic pressures at 5 degreesC confirmed its barotolerance and its nativity to deep-sea sediments. We propose that deep-sea sediments are a source of paleobes, which could be useful in studies on palaeoclimate, long-term microbial survival and biotechnology. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Endolichenic fungi within 17 lichen species in the area near Ny-lesund (Svalbard, High Arctic) were studied by a culture-based method. The 247 fungal isolates were obtained from 2712 lichen thallus segments. The colonization rate of endolichenic fungi ranged from 1.6 to 26.5 %, respectively. These isolates were identified to 40 fungal taxa, including 35 Ascomycota (10 orders), 4 Basidiomycota (3 orders), and 1 unidentified fungus. Thelebolales was the most abundant order, while Sordariales were the most diverse order. The common fungal taxa shared by more than 3 lichen species were Thelebolus microsporus (93 isolates), Coniochaeta hoffmannii (7 isolates), Sarocladium kiliense (33 isolates), Coniochaeta sp. 1 (5 isolates), Coniochaeta sp. 4 (28 isolates), and Coniochaeta sp. 2 (5 isolates). Low Sorenson's similarity coefficients were observed among different lichen species, indicating that host-related factor may shape the endolichenic fungal communities in this region. In addition, no endolichenic fungal taxa were previously found in the Antarctica and Austrian Alps, suggesting endolichenic fungal communities in this region might be also shaped by the Arctic climate. The results demonstrate the existence of specific cultured endolichenic fungal species, which may be suitable objects for further study of their possible functional roles in the lichen thalli.

AB  - Soil filamentous fungi from Ny-Alesund, Spitsbergen, were studied. A total of 30 fungal isolates were identified by morpho-taxonomy, and the identity of some morpho-taxonomically complex isolates was authenticated by ITS1-5.8S and ITS2 rDNA domain sequence similarity. The isolates belonged to 19 species under 14 genera (Acremonium, Arthrinium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Corynespora, Emericella, Geomyces, Mortierella, Mucor, Myrothecium, Penicillium, Phialophora, Preussia, Xylaria). To the best of our knowledge, Acremonium roseolum, Aspergillus aculeatus, Emericella nidulans, and Preussia sp. are the first northernmost records from Arctic soils. The viable fungal count in different soil samples varied from 0.5 x 10(4) to 2.0 x 10(5) g(-1). Species richness in different soil samples was also calculated. Mortierella was one of the most dominant genera in Arctic soils. A temperature tolerance study was carried out for all the isolates, and representative species were screened for their extracellular enzyme activity (amylase, cellulase, phosphatase, and pectinase) at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Among the 30 isolates, seven showed cellulolytic activity, two were phosphate solubilizers, three had amylolytic activity, and only one showed pectinolytic activity on solid media. CMCase (beta 1, 4-endoglucanase) activity was quantified in seven isolates that exhibited positive activity during preliminary screening. The records of enzyme activity for amylases, pectinases, and cellulases are the first from the fungi of Spitsbergen. The present study indicates the dominance in Ny-Alesund of cellulolytic strains, which may serve as potent decomposers in Arctic tundra. These isolates may be used to facilitate the mineralization of cellulolytic wastes generated by human activities in colder hilly areas across the world, including the Himalayas in India.

AU  - Hassett, Brandon T.
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - A unicellular, heterotrophic, eukaryotic parasite was isolated from nearshore Arctic marine sediment in association with the diatom Pleurosigma sp. The parasite possessed ectoplasmic threads that could penetrate diatom frustules. Healthy and reproducing Pleurosigma cultures would begin to collapse within a week following the introduction of this parasite. The parasite (2-10 mu m diameter) could reproduce epibiotically with biflagellate zoospores, as well as binary division inside and outside the diatom host. While the parasite grew, diatom intracellular content disappeared. Evaluation of electron micrographs from co-cultures revealed the presence of hollow tubular processes and amorphic cells that could transcend the diatom frustule, generally at the girdle band, as well as typical thraustochytrid ultrastructure, such as the presence of bothrosomes. After nucleotide extraction, amplification, and cloning, database queries of DNA revealed closest molecular affinity to environmental thraustochytrid clone sequences. Testing of phylogenetic hypotheses consistently grouped this unknown parasite within the Thraustochytriidae on a distinct branch within the environmental sequence clade Lab19. Reclassification of Arctic high-throughput sequencing data, with appended reference datasets that included this diatom parasite, indicated that the majority of thraustochytrid sequences, previously binned as unclassifiable stramenopiles, are allied to this new isolate. Based on the combined information acquired from electron microscopy, life history, and phylogenetic testing, this unknown isolate is described as a novel species and genus.

Ny-angstrom lesund of Arctic region is one of the northernmost polar area of our world. In order to understand the geo-microbiological features of this unexplored habitat, a total of 51 heterotrophic bacterial isolates were isolated from Ny-angstrom lesund soil sample. More than 74% (38 isolates) of the isolates showed significant extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity, such as amylase, protease, lipase, DNase, phosphatase etc. Combined hydrolytic degradation have been detected in a number of isolates. The best producers were identified on the basis of 16s rRNA gene Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic distribution of the identified strains shows high presence (71%) of gamma-Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas sp.; Acinetobacter sp.) in the sample. Two other genera Paenibacillus and Planococcus were also identified.

AB  - Atmospheric sounding using the Tu-134 Optik aircraft-laboratory was conducted in September 2020 over the seas of the Russian sector of the Arctic Ocean, namely the Barents, Kara, Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi and Bering seas. Unique samples of atmospheric aerosols at altitudes from 200 and up to 10,000 m were taken, including samples for the identification of cultivated microorganisms and their genetic analysis. Data on the concentration and diversity of bacteria and fungi isolated from 24 samples of atmospheric aerosols are presented; the main phenotypic and genomic characteristics were obtained for 152 bacterial cultures; and taxonomic belonging was determined. The concentration of cultured microorganisms detected in aerosols of different locations was similar, averaging 5.5 x 103 CFU/m3. No dependence of the number of isolated microorganisms on the height and location of aerosol sampling was observed. The presence of pathogenic and condto shitionally pathogenic bacteria, including those referred to in the genera Staphylococcus, Kocuria, Rothia, Comamonas, Brevundimonas, Acinetobacter, and others, as well as fungi represented by the widely spread genera Aureobasidium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Penicillium, capable of causing infectious and allergic diseases were present in most analyzed samples. Obtained data reveal the necessity of systematic studies of atmospheric microbiota composition to combat emerging population diseases.

AU  - Savolainen, Tiina

T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Aims Competition has been shown to modify the niche breadth of coexisting species, but within-species interactions have received little attention. Establishing small juvenile individuals and established, larger, sexually reproducing adult individuals represent two life-history stages within species. We investigated the nitrogen and carbon resource use of adult and juvenile individuals and similarity of symbiotic fungal community composition in these two plant life stages. We used the plant Solidago virgaurea growing in a simplified system in the low Arctic as model species. Methods Isotopic signatures (foliar delta N-15 and foliar delta C-13) were analysed to characterize nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency of the plants. Symbiotic root fungal community composition was estimated by cloning and sequencing small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Important Findings The isotopic signatures differed significantly between the life stages, indicating that the establishing juvenile cohort used relatively more amino acids or gained N through mycorrhizal symbiosis in comparison to the established adult plants. Symbiotic fungal communities did not differ between the two plant cohorts suggesting a possibility that the plants shared the same mycorrhizal network. We conclude that competition-mediated differences in plant resource use may create niche differentiation between the two life-history stages and enable them to coexist.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a common pathogen in domestic ruminants that causes granulomatous inflammation of the small intestine leading to emaciation and wasting. Clinical disease (Johne's disease) is also reported for several wild ruminant species. Between 2007 and 2009 we collected 561 fecal samples from caribou (Rangifer tarandus ssp.) representing 10 herds of migratory caribou, two herds of caribou from Greenland, and three populations of boreal woodland caribou. Feces were tested for MAP by bacterial culture and PCR targeting the IS900 insertion sequence. In total, 31 samples from eight different populations representing all three ecotypes were found positive for MAP by PCR, with one sample from the Riviere-aux-Feuilles herd also being culture positive for the type II (cattle) strain. The proportion of positive animals was particularly high in the Akia-Maniitsoq herd in Greenland, and Riviere-aux-Feuilles and Riviere-George herds in northeastern Canada (2:3.4, 11..5, and 10.0%, respectively). Our results indicate that MAP is present in several caribou herds of different ecotypes in northern Canada and Greenland and that MAP circulates within wildlife populations that do not have ongoing contact with domestic livestock. The epidemiology, pathogenicity, and effects on the health of caribou in northern ecosystems remain unknown.

AB  - Metabarcoding technologies for soil fungal DNA pools have enabled to capture the diversity of fungal community and the agreement of their beta-diversity with plant beta-diversity. However, processes underlying the synchrony of the aboveground-belowground biodiversity is still unclear. By using partitioning methods for plant beta-diversity, this study explored the process driving synchrony in tundra ecosystems, in which drastic vegetation shifts are observed with climate warming. Our methods based on Baselga's partitioning enabled the division of plant beta-diversity into two phenomena and three functional components. Correlation of fungal beta-diversity with the components of plant beta-diversity showed that the spatial replacement of fungi was promoted by plant species turnover, in particular, plant species turnover with functional exchange. In addition, spatial variety of graminoid or forbs species, rather than shrubs, enhanced fungal beta-diversity. These results suggest the importance of small-scale factors such as plant-fungal interactions or local environments modified by plants for the fungal community assemblage. The process-based understanding of community dynamics of plants and fungi allows us to predict the ongoing shrub encroachment in the Arctic region, which could weaken the aboveground-belowground synchrony.

AB  - The effect of temperature on the growth of Chrysosporium pannorum, Cylindrocarpon sp., Penicillium janthinellum and Phoma herbarum, isolated from tundra soils, was studied. The growth in 2 systems, glucose-mineral agar plates and sand, moistened with glucose-mineral broth, was compared. All isolates showed an exponential increase in mass (measured as protein increase) in sand and a linear rate of extension on agar. Radial increase on agar was shown not to be a good index of growth in sand. Trends in growth rates in the sand cultures indicated that all 4 fungi can grow at low temperatures. The growth rate for P. janthinellum at 15.degree. C was higher than at 20.degree. C, and Cylindrocarpon sp. and P. herbarum had higher growth rates at 2.5.degree. C than at 5.degree. C. These data suggest that there may be some adaptation by these fungi to growth in Arctic regions.

AB  - The exploration of extraterrestrial environments has become a focal point of scientific inquiry, driven by advancements in technology and a growing interest in the potential for life beyond Earth. This study investigates the adaptability of Antarctic nematodes, known for thriving in extreme cold and isolation, to simulated Martian (MGS-1) and Lunar (LMS-1) soils. The experiment revealed differential responses in nematode survivability to the two simulants, with Lunar soil demonstrating better adaptability compared to Martian soil. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential survivability of Antarctic nematodes on real Martian and Lunar substrates with the use of the MGS-1 and the LMS-1 under terrestrial conditions. The observed results suggest differential survival responses to Lunar (6.92 +/- 0.74) and Martian (5.58 +/- 1.91) regolith simulants and highlight the complexity of factors influencing organismal survival. Considering their crucial role in soil food webs, and their relation with nutrient cycling and carbon dioxide emissions, the observed capacity of nematodes to thrive in Martian and Lunar regoliths positions them as potential candidates to sustain human habitats, helping on the development of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems, and forming the basis for a biological life-support system to facilitate human survival in extraterrestrial environments.

AB  - The discordant trend of plant and fungal beta-diversity suggested an ecological rule reflecting plant-fungal interaction. Beta-diversity partitioning has shown that the nestedness component is developed with environmental stress in a variety of taxa. However, soil fungal community may maintain its turnover components in contrast to the development of plants' nestedness component, and the potential causes remain unclear. To investigate the process of species turnover of soil fungi along a stress gradient in the Arctic, we divided species turnover component into sub-components: beta(sim_hete) and beta(sim_homo) representing species turnover with and without a change in the guilds, respectively. The results indicate that fungal communities maintain their turnover components, unlike plant communities; however, their beta(sim_hete) increased under stressful conditions. Additionally, GDM analysis showed that beta(sim_hete) was mainly explained by stress gradient and plant nestedness, suggesting that the functionality of soil fungi was ecologically filtered by environmental stress and plant community structure. The discordant trend of beta-diversity values between plant and fungi (i.e. development of plant nestedness and maintenance of fungal turnover) is possibly not caused by different assembly rules working in parallel on the two taxa, but according to an ecological rule that reflects plant-fungal interaction.

AB  - Feeding habits of 25 spp. of oribatids from the North America arctic and subarctic were determined by gut content analysis. Over 50% are panphytophages, a feeding habit considered to be ecologically advantageous, in that a particular species can survive in many different habitats. Microphytophagous species (11) were recorded, predominantly from the Damaeoidea, Eremaeoidea and Oppioidea. Individuals of 11 spp. of Oribatei were plated to examine the importance of mites in disseminating fungi. Fungal species (20) were identified from colonies growing on approximately 60% of the plates. Most of the isolated fungi have a world-wide distribution, occurring in soils from tropical to arctic regions. Fecal pellets from 7 spp. were also plated. Fungal colonies grew from only 14% of these pellets which may be a result of the feeding habits of the species examined. Most species being panphytophagous, the amount of fungal material in their gut would vary from meal to meal. The direct and indirect effects of oribatid mites on decomposition within the soil ecosystem is discussed.

T2  - POLISH POLAR RESEARCH
AB  - Fungi are highly diverse, yet only a minor part of the total estimated species has been cultured and characterized. This might be especially true for Arctic, where studies on the fungal diversity are still scarce. For that reason, our aim was to analyze fungal diversity in the droppings of Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus. The samples of feces from 32 adult individuals were collected in the southern or central parts of the Wedel Jarlsberg Land (Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago) and assessed for micromycetes diversity using a combination of classical and molecular identification approaches. We found 16 fungal species, out of which three were described as mesophilic, two as psychrotolerant and eleven as psychrophilic. The identified Arctic fungi belonged to eleven genera out of which representatives of Naganishia genus (formerly belonging to Cryptococcus albidus clade) were the most abundant fungal species isolated. Additionally, to our knowledge, we firstly recorded Botrytis cinerea in polar areas. We conclude that droppings of R. tarandus platyrhynchus are a source of different fungal taxa, including fungi potentially pathogenic towards humans, plants and insects.

AB  - A total of 331 aerobic heterotrophic bacterial strains were isolated from various ecosystems of Finnish Lapland (68-69 degrees N) including forest soil, arctic alpine-tundra soil, stream water, lake and mire sediments, lichen and snow algae. Whole cell fatty acid and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and microscopy indicated that the isolates were dominated by Gram-negative bacteria, while only 20 Gram-positive strains were isolated. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences the isolates were members of alpha-, beta-, gamma-Proteobacteria, Gram-positives with low G+C content, Actinobacteria and the Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides group. More than one-third of the isolates could be tentatively identified as Pseudomonas spp. which were particularly abundant in the alpine-tundra soils where they represented 60% of all isolates. Other frequently isolated Gram-negative taxa were Burkholderia sp., Collimonas sp., Pedobacter sp., Janthinobacter sp., Duganella sp., Dyella sp. and Sphingomonas sp. Growth temperature ranges and hydrolytic enzyme activities of selected ca. 100 strains were screened. The strains were psychrotolerant growing generally at temperatures ranging from 0 to 30 degrees C, as 82% of the isolates grew at 0 degrees C while only 7% grew at 35 degrees C. Protease and lipase activities at 5 degrees C were detected in more than half of the strains while approximately 20% of the strains possessed amylase and/or cellulase activities.

AB  - Aim To screen and identify a potential biosurfactant-producing yeast strain isolated from Antarctic soil and to evaluate the fermentation process kinetics of the most promising strain on biosurfactant production using glycerol as carbon source. Methods and Results From the 68 isolated yeast strains, 11 strains were able to produce biosurfactants after Emulsification Index (E.I.) and Drop Collapse tests, reaching an E.I. higher than 10%. Strain 1_4.0 was the best producer, identified as Candida glaebosa based on molecular analysis. Yeast was cultivated in a medium composed of glycerol supplemented with yeast extract for 120 h to determine the process kinetics. The increased C/N ratio affected yeast growth and biosurfactant production. Biosurfactant release was associated with the end of exponential and beginning of the stationary growth phases. Results indicated an E.I. of 30% at the end of the fermentation. Conclusions The feasiability of C. glaebosa to produce biosurfactant from a low-cost medium cultivation shows a great impact on the development of bioresource in the Antarctica terrestrial environment. Significance and Impact of the Study Although the diversity of psychrophilic/psychrotolerant micro-organisms from Antarctica has been the preferred subject of study by microbiologists, terrestrial microfungal communities are scarcely investigated and literature about the biotechnological potential of such micro-organisms should cover important biomolecules in addition to cold-adapted enzymes. In the present study, for the first time, the Maritime Antarctica environment was screened as a novel source of biosurfactants produced by micro-organisms.

AU  - Ramdass, Amanda C.

T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Background Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) belong to the class of glycolipid biosurfactants and are produced by members of the Ustilago and Moesziomyces genera. Production of MELs is regulated by a biosynthetic gene cluster (MEL BGC). Extracellular lipase activity is also associated with MEL production. Most microbial glycolipid-producers are isolated from oil-contaminated environments. MEL-producing yeast that are capable of metabolizing crude oil are understudied, and there is very limited data on indigenous strains from tropical climates. Analysis of the MEL BGC and lipase genes in Trinidad M. antarcticus strains, using a gene-targeted approach, revealed a correlation between their intrinsic capability to degrade crude oil and their adaptation to survive in a chronically polluted terrestrial environment. Results M. antarcticus was isolated from naturally-occurring crude oil seeps and an asphaltic mud volcano in Trinidad; these are habitats that have not been previously reported for this species. Genus identification was confirmed by the large-subunit (LSU) and the small-subunit (SSU) sequence comparisons and species identification was confirmed by ITS sequence comparisons and phylogenetic inference. The essential genes (Emt1, Mac1, Mac2, Mmf1) of the MEL BGC were detected with gene-specific primers. Emt1p, Mac1p and Mmf1p sequence analyses confirmed that the Trinidad strains harboured novel synonymous amino acid (aa) substitutions and structural comparisons revealed different regions of disorder, specifically for the Emt1p sequence. Functionality of each protein sequence was confirmed through motif mining and mutation prediction. Phylogenetic relatedness was inferred for Emt1p, Mac1p and Mmf1p sequences. The Trinidad strains clustered with other M. antarcticus sequences, however, the representative Trinidad M. antarcticus sequences consistently formed a separate, highly supported branch for each protein. Similar phylogenetic placement was indicated for LipA and LipB nucleotide and protein sequences. The Trinidad strains also demonstrated lipolytic activity in culture, with an ability to utilize different carbon sources. Comparative evolution of MEL BGC and LipA gene suggested early and late duplication events, depending on the gene, followed by a number of speciation events within Ustilaginaceae. M. antarcticus and M. aphidis were separated from all other members of Ustilaginaceae and two gene homologues were detected, one for each species. Conclusions Sequence analyses was based on a novel gene-targeted approach to analyze the essential genes of the MEL BGC and LipA and LipB genes of M. antarcticus strains from Trinidad. The findings indicated that these strains accumulated nucleotide mutations to a threshold level that did not affect the function of specific proteins encoded by the MEL BGC and LipA and LipB genes. The biosurfactant and lipase enzymes secreted by these Trinidad M. antarcticus strains facilitated their survival in oil-contaminated terrestrial environments. These findings suggest that the Trinidad strains should be explored as promising candidates for the commercial production of MEL biosurfactants and lipase enzymes.

T2  - ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
AB  - Quantitative changes in bacterial, fungal and algal populations in the surface peat (0-5 cm depth) were studied during the spring thaw period at a tundra hummocky sedge-moss meadow (Devon Island, N.W.T. [Northwest Territories], Canada). A significant peak in numbers of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and in amounts of filamentous algae was observed during the thaw period. No significant maximum in fungal standing crop was evident during this period but an increase in the hyphae containing protoplasm after thaw was indicative of increased fungal activity. Data obtained at each sampling time were highly variable. This was probably due to the topographic heterogeneity of the site which gave rise to variation in soil moisture content and microenvironment. Qualitative changes in bacterial populations were studied before and after the thaw. Gram-negative psychotrophic types predominated and Bacillus spp. were rarely isolated. Certain gram-negative groups, the fluorescent pseudomonads and the Cytophaga/Flexibacter types, were isolated less frequently after thaw while gram-negative orange pigmented rods, Arthrobacter spp. and other coryneforms occurred more frequently after the thaw.

AB  - The effect of 36 l m-2 of 20% and 100% methanol spillage on the microflora of a soil near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, was assessed. GLC was used to monitor the residual methanol in the soil. Associated with residual methanol determination were measurements of changes in numbers of bacteria, fungal standing crop, respiration and isolation of methanol-utilizing bacteria. Methanol spillage (20%) had 2 different effects on the surface vegetation, in that the vegetation was killed in some plots and not others. The applied methanol disappeared completely between 1-4 wk. No increased soil activity (as indicated by respiration, bacterial numbers, fungal standing crop) was detected when methanol was present in the soil. Because only 1 bacterium (i.e., pink gram negative rods) metabolized only very small concentrations of methanol, biodegradation of methanol was not considered a significant agent affecting methanol loss from the soil.

AB  - This study describes the biodiversity of the indigenous microbial community in the sodium-chloride water brines (cryopegs) derived from ancient marine sediments and sandwiched within permafrost 100-120,000 years ago after the Arctic Ocean regression. Cryopegs remain liquid at the in situ temperature of -9 to -11 degrees C and make up the only habitat on the Earth that is characterized by permanently subzero temperatures, high salinity, and the absence of external influence during geological time. From these cryopegs, anaerobic and aerobic, spore-less and spore-forming, halotolerant and halophilic, psychrophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, mycelial fungi and yeast were isolated and their activity was detected below 0 degrees C.

AB  - Using the method of inoculation of elective nutrient media, the abundance and taxonomic diversity of ecological and trophic groups of microorganisms in soils of the northern part of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago were evaluated. The content of aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen fixers, as well as denitrifiers, was low (tens and hundreds of CFU/g soil). The number of saprotrophic bacteria varied from 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) CFU/g soil; actinomycetes, from 1.3 x 10(3) to 4.0 x 10(5) CFU/g soil; and micromycetes, from 2.5 x 10(2) to 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/g soil. The abundances of all studied groups of microorganisms (except for aerobic nitrogen fixers) in the studied soils sharply decreased down the profile, and this correlated positively with the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen. The community of soil microorganisms was dominated by gram-positive bacteria of the genera Arthrobacter and Bacillus; actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces and Micromonospora; and micromycetes of the genera Goffeauzyma, Phoma, Pseudogymnoascus, and Thelebolus. In general, the abundance and taxonomic diversity of cultured microorganisms in the soils of the northern part of Novaya Zemlya were lower than in the soils of the more northern territories of the Franz Josef Land Archipelago. This phenomenon is associated with the drying and cooling effect of the largest glacier in Russia on the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago.

AB  - This paper reports the discovery of endolithic algae from vertical limestone cliffs associated with the Niagara Escarpment, southern Ontario, Canada. The endolithic habitat forms a distinctive dark green layer 1-3 mm below the surface of the porous dolomitic limestone. Samples of the algal layer were isolated from freshly cleaved rock samples using sterile probes and grown on a solid (agarized) standard algal mineral medium supplemented with soil extract. A diverse assemblage of organisms grew on the agar plates, including bacteria, fungi, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), green algae, yellow-green algae, and occasionally the protonemata of mosses. Isolated algae belong to unicellular, colonial, and filamentous morphological types. Algal genera that have been identified include seven blue-green algae (Cyanophyta or Cyanobacteria), six green algae (Chlorophyta), and one yellow-green alga (Xanthophyceae). Six of the algal genera found in Ontario rocks also occur inside rocks of the Colorado plateau in northern Arizona, and one genus also occurs inside Antarctic rocks.

AB  - The mycobiota of the following soils of the Franz Josef Land archipelago was characterized using the classical plating techniques and real-time PCR methods: Cryosols (Arenic), Cryosols (Loamic), Oxyaquic Cryosols (Loamic), Leptosols (Loamic), and Cryosols (Loamic, Humic). The total abundance of microscopic fungi varied from 3.10 x 10(1) CFU/g soil in deep mineral horizons to 6.56 x 10(3) CFU/g soil in the upper organogenic soil horizons. A total of 47 micromycete species were isolated, which belonged to 32 genera from three divisions. Psychrotolerant strains growing at both 5 and 25 degrees C were predominant. The genera Penicillium (five species), Cadophora (four species), Cladosporium, Phoma, and Thelebolus (three species each) exhibited the highest species diversity. The most numerous genera: Penicillium, Hyphozyma, Phoma, Antarctomyces, and Pseudogymnoascus, were saprotrophic and common in cold ecosystems. Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Hyphozyma variabilis var. variabilis, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, Thelebolus microsporus, and Goffeauzyma gilvescens were the species most often revealed by plating (over 40% occurrence). A significant part (30%) of identified species were those included in the BSL database of species pathogenic for humans and animals. The number of copies of fungal rRNA gene ITSs varied from 1.00 x 10(9) to 4.40 x 10(10) copies/g soil in the mineral and organogenic layers, respectively. Spatial heterogeneity of mycobiota in the soils of the Franz Josef Land archipelago was revealed within the upper 5-cm layer, while deeper horizons were characterized by a uniform structure of micromycete communities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Psychrotolerant yeast Rhodotorula sp. Y-23 was isolated from the sediment core sub-samples of Nella Lake, East Antarctica. Isolate was screened for lipase production using plate assay method followed by submerged fermentation. Production optimization revealed the maximum lipase production by using palmolein oil (5% v/v), pH 8.0 and inoculum size of 2.5% v/v at 15 degrees C. The potential inducers for lipase were 1% w/v of galactose and KNO3, and MnCl2 (0.1% w/v). Final productions with optimized conditions gave 5.47-fold increase in lipase production. Dialyzed product gave a purification fold of 5.63 with specific activity of 26.83Umg(-1) and 15.67% yields. This lipase was more stable at pH 5.0 and -20 degrees C whereas more activity was found at pH 8.0 and 35 degrees C. Stability was more in 50mM Fe3+, EDTA-Na (20mM), sodium deoxycholate (20mM), H2O2 (1% v/v), and almost all organic solvents (50% v/v). Tolerance capacity at wider range of pH and temperature with having lower K-m value i.e., 0.08mgml(-1) and higher V-max 385.68Umg(-1) at 15 degrees C make the studied lipase useful for industrial applications. Besides this, the lipase was compatible with commercially available detergents, and its addition to them increases lipid degradation performances making it a potential candidate in detergent formulation.

AB  - The potential for Pythium species to reduce sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) seedling growth and for rhizobia and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi to enhance seedling growth were studied under controlled conditions. Seedling emergence and shoot dry weights of cvs. Nova and Melrose in pasteurized soils infested with each of 18 isolates of Pythium spp. were reduced. Seedlings inoculated with arctic rhizobia grew more rapidly than noninoculated seedlings. Plant growth, nodule dry weight, nitrogenase activity, and mycorrhizal colonization of sainfoin dually inoculated with Rhizobium plus either Glomus fasciculatus or G. intraradices were greater than those of uninoculated plants or those inoculated with either rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungus alone; nitrogen content was higher in plants concomitantly inoculated with Rhizobium plus G. intraradices. Seedling survival and growth in Pythium-infested soil increased for seeds treated with metalaxyl. Interactions of VA mycorrhizal fungi and two isolates of Pythium were investigated under controlled conditions. Shoot dry weights of sainfoin plants inoculated with VA mycorrhizal fungi significantly exceeded those of nonmycorrhizal plants. Seedlings inoculated with VA mycorrhizal fungi had a lower incidence of root rot than non-mycorrhizal ones. This study suggested that a combination of rhizobia, metalaxyl, and VA mycorrhizal fungi could be used to improve the establishment and vigor of sainfoin in Pythium-infested soils.

TI  - Environmental DNA - An emerging tool in conservation for monitoring past and present biodiversity
AU  - Thomsen, Philip Francis

T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.

Samples were collected from introduced objects such as a mummified penguin and spent chewing tobacco in addition to the sparse soil found in rock fissures, isolated moss colonies, shoreline deposit materials, CaCO3 precipitates, and microbial mat debris obtained from the frozen surface of the lake in the basin of Taylor Valley. Using conventional media and techniques, all collection sites yielded populations of yeasts and filamentous fungi. Water samples and live microbial mats from beneath the lake ice yielded species of fungi along with an abundance of bacteria.

AB  - Extremophiles are organisms adapted to grow at extreme ranges of environmental variables, such as high or low temperatures, acid or alkaline medium, high salt concentration, high pressures and so forth. Most extremophiles are micro-organisms that belong to the Archaea and Bacteria domains, and are widely spread across the world, which include the polar regions, volcanoes, deserts, deep oceanic sediments, hydrothermal vents, hypersaline lakes, acid and alkaline water bodies, and other extreme environments considered hostile to human life. Despite the tropical climate, Brazil has a wide range of ecosystems which include some permanent or seasonally extreme environments. For example, the Cerrado is a biome with very low soil pH with high Al+3 concentration, the mangroves in the Brazilian coast are anaerobic and saline, Pantanal has thousands of alkaline-saline lakes, the Caatinga arid and hot soils and the deep sea sediments in the Brazilian ocean shelf. These environments harbour extremophilic organisms that, coupled with the high natural biodiversity in Brazil, could be explored for different purposes. However, only a few projects in Brazil intended to study the extremophiles. In the frame of astrobiology, for example, these organisms could provide important models for defining the limits of life and hypothesize about life outside Earth. Brazilian microbiologists have, however, studied the extremophilic micro-organisms inhabiting non-Brazilian environments, such as the Antarctic continent. The experience and previous results obtained from the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) provide important results that are directly related to astrobiology. This article is a brief synopsis of the Brazilian experience in researching extremophiles, indicating the most important results related to astrobiology and some future perspectives in this area.

AB  - In Iceland, extensive afforestation programmes have been initiated, often involving the outplanting of nursery seedling stock on eroded land. In some areas high seedling mortality, to a large extent due to root damage caused by Otiorhynchus spp. larvae, has been reported. Even though recent studies have shown that inoculation with entomopathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi may reduce the effects of Otiorhynchus spp. on seedling mortality, information on the occurrence and distribution of these key fungal species in Icelandic soils is limited. The present study reports findings of a targeted survey on the occurrence and distribution of entomopathogenic fungi and birch (Betula pubescens) root symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in Icelandic soils from key habitats representing birch woodland, heathland and degraded/eroded land. Entomopathogenic fungi were isolated from soil by baiting with Tenebrio molitor and Galleria mellonella larvae. Identification to species was achieved based on standard morphotyping of cultures that included conidiophores and conidia. Birch seedling root symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungal distribution in eroded and birch woodland soil was determined following baiting with birch seedlings over 9 months and classification based on gross morphology. Significant lower frequency and diversity of both entomopathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi were detected in soil collected from eroded areas compared to soil from vegetated areas (birch and heathland). Three species of entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae and Isaria farinosa were present in soil samples collected from the birch woodland and heathland sites. In contrast, no insect pathogenic fungi were found in soil collected from the eroded sites. B. bassiana and M. anisopliae were recorded for the first time in Iceland. The incidence of mycorrhizal root tips was higher on seedlings grown in soil from birch woodland than in soil from eroded land and a higher diversity of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was found in birch soil. The importance of these findings is discussed in relation to afforestation in Iceland.

AB  - Cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces are ice-cold hot spots of microbial diversity and activity but still little is known about their fungal inhabitants. We provide the first report of distinctive fungal communities in cryoconite debris from three valley glaciers at Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Multivariate analysis of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of rRNA ITS amplicons revealed that quite distinct fungal communities were found in cryoconite holes compared with soils from adjacent moraine and tundra sites, and that communities on glaciers with contrasting ice-surface hydrology also differed. Most of the fungi cultured from cryoconite sediment were basidiomycetous yeasts or filamentous Ascomycota (Helotiales/Pleosporales). The latter included aeroaquatic fungi, such as Articulospora and Varicosporium, implying a role for these important freshwater decomposers in the carbon dynamics of cryoconite holes. Matching of the dominant peaks from T-RFLP analysis to predicted peaks of cultured isolates confirmed the abundance of these aeroaquatic fungi but also revealed that most of the dominant T-RFLP peaks did not match any cultured isolates. Considering the prevalence and endangerment of glacial environments worldwide, these findings would suggest that their potential as reservoirs of fungal diversity should not be overlooked.

AB  - This study assessed the diversity and distribution of filamentous fungi obtained from water sampled from six lakes in the Antarctic Peninsula. One hundred and twenty-eight fungal isolates were purified and identified by analysis of nuclear rDNA ITS region sequences as belonging to 31 fungal different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most frequently isolated fungi were Geomyces pannorum and Mortierella sp.; these species occurred in six and three of the lakes sampled, respectively, and displayed the highest total colony-forming unit per L. Different species that have not been found to these lakes and/or had adapted to cold conditions were found. In general, the fungal community displayed low richness and high dominance indices. The species Cadophora cf. luteo-olivacea, Cadophora malorum, Davidiella tassiana, G.pannorum, Mortierella cf. alpina and Thelebolus cf. microsporus that were found in the lakes in question were also previously found in other cold ecosystems, such as Arctic, temperate and Alpine regions. The results of this study suggest the presence of an interesting aquatic fungal web, including symbionts, weak and strong saprophytes and parasite/pathogen fungal species. This aquatic web fungal may be a useful community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies of extreme habitats.

AB  - Aim Polar and alpine ecosystems appear to be particularly sensitive to increasing temperatures and the altered precipitation patterns linked to climate change. However, little is currently known about how these environmental drivers may affect edaphic organisms within these ecosystems. In this study, we examined communities of plant root-associated fungi (RAF) over large biogeographical scales and along climatic gradients in the North Atlantic region in order to gain insights into the potential effects of climate variability on these communities. We also investigated whether selected fungal traits were associated with particular climates. Locations Austria, Scotland, Mainland Norway, Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Taxa Root fungi associated with the ectomycorrhizal and herbaceous plant Bistorta vivipara. Methods DNA metabarcoding of the ITS1 region was used to characterize the RAF of 302 whole plant root systems, which were analysed by means of ordination methods and linear modelling. Fungal spore length, width, volume and shape, as well as mycelial exploration type (ET) of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes were summarized at a community level. Results The RAF communities exhibited strong biogeographical structuring, and both compositional variation as well as fungal species richness correlated with annual temperature and precipitation. In accordance with general island biogeography theory, the least species-rich RAF communities were found on Jan Mayen, a remote and small island in the North Atlantic Ocean. Fungal spores tended to be more elongated with increasing latitude. We also observed a climate effect on which mycelial ET was dominating among the ectomycorrhizal fungi. Main conclusions Both geographical and environmental variables were important for shaping root-associated fungal communities at a North Atlantic scale, including the High Arctic. Fungal OTU richness followed general biogeographical patterns and decreased with decreasing size and/or increasing isolation of the host plant population. The probability of possessing more elongated spores increases with latitude, which may be explained by a selection for greater dispersal capacity among more isolated host plant populations in the Arctic.

AB  - The historic expedition huts located in the Ross Sea Region of the Antarctic and the thousands of artifacts left behind by the early explorers represent important cultural heritage from the “Heroic Era” of Polar exploration. The hut at Cape Royds built by Ernest Shackleton and members of the 1907-1908 British Antarctic Expedition has survived the extreme Antarctic environment for over 100 years, but recent studies have shown many forms of deterioration are causing serious problems, and microbial degradation is evident in the historic wood. Conservation work to reduce moisture at the hut required removal of fodder, wood, and many different types of organic materials from the stables area on the north side of the structure allowing large numbers of samples to be obtained for these investigations. In addition, wood from historic food storage boxes exposed in a ravine adjacent to the hut were also sampled. Fungi were cultured on several different media, and pure cultures were obtained and identified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA. From the 69 cultures of filamentous fungi obtained, the most predominant genera were Cadophora (44%) followed by Thielavia (17%) and Geomyces (15%). Other fungi found included Cladosporium, Chaetomium, and isolates identified as being in Pezizomycotina, Onygenales, Nectriaceae, and others. No filamentous basidiomycetes were found. Phylogenetic analyses of the Cadophora species showed great species diversity present revealing Cadophora malorum, Cadophora luteo-olivacea, Cadophora fastigiata, as well as Cadophora sp. 4E71-1, a C. malorum-like species, and Cadophora sp. 7R16-1, a C. fastigiata-like species. Scanning electron microscopy showed extensive decay was present in the wood samples with type 1 and type 2 forms of soft rot evident in pine and birch wood, respectively. Fungi causing decay in the historic wooden structures and artifacts are of great concern, and this investigation provides insight into the identity and species diversity of fungi found at the site. The historic woods and other organic materials at this site represent a large input of carbon into the Antarctic environment. This as well as nutrient additions from the nearby Ad,lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony and favorable conditions for fungal growth at Cape Royds appear responsible for the significant fungal diversity, and where extensive decay is taking place in wood in contact with the ground.

T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were extracted from samples of eight different sites of sandy soils in Iceland. Eleven species of AMF were identified directly from original soil samples or trap culture using the host plant Allium porrum. Six AMF species were successfully subcultured in pots with the host plant Plantago lanceolata. Species from four genera of the order Glomerales (Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Glomus, and Scutellospora) were identified. The AMF species identified from subcultured pots included Glomus hoi, G. clarum, and a species of Scutellospora resembling S. dipurpurascens. Three other, as yet unidentified, species of Glomus were also isolated. AMF root colonization was estimated on Leymus arenarius (lymegrass), the main dune-building grass in Iceland during the growing season. Total AMF root colonization did not depend upon the season. However, percentage root colonization of arbuscules was significantly highest in July, indicating the highest peak of functional AMF activity. This survey of AMF is the first conducted in Iceland. The importance of this work is discussed in relation to occurrence of AMF species in polar regions and in relation to sand dune reclamation.

AB  - Premise of research. Despite the ecological significance of arbuscular mycorrhizae in modern terrestrial ecosystems, knowledge about their evolution based on the fossil record is still scarce, especially concerning the case of root nodules harboring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, as in some extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. Exceptionally preserved conifer nodular roots were found in the Jurassic fossil-bearing chert deposits of the Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz, Argentina), raising the possibility of studying them in association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The aim of this study is to describe the plant organs and their fungal partners and to discuss the ecological significance of the interactions observed, particularly with respect to their occurrence in the hot spring settings. Methodology. Thin sections of chert samples from the Canadon Nahuel locality of the La Matilde Formation, Deseado Massif (Santa Cruz, Argentina) were observed using light microscopy. Pivotal results. The cortex of the nodules is occupied by several glomeromycotan fungal structures. The structures occur in a specific zone of the cortex-toward its center-and include intracellular hyphal coils and arbuscules. Glomoid spores and coenocytic hyphae possibly penetrating the epidermal cells are also described and analyzed. Conclusions. The root nodules have affinities with the Araucariales, representing the oldest record of such structures for this conifer clade. This is also the first record of nodules harboring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for the Jurassic; it extends our knowledge of the fossil record for this particular type of fungal association.

AB  - While a vast number of studies have addressed the prokaryotic diversity in permafrost, characterized by subzero temperatures, low water activity, and extremely low rates of nutrient and metabolite transfer, fungal patterns have received surprisingly limited attention. Here, the fungal diversity and community structure were investigated by culture-dependent technique combined with cloning-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of sediments in a 10-m-long permafrost core from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. A total of 62 fungal phylotypes related to 10 distinct classes representing three phyla were recovered from 5031 clones generated in 13 environmental gene libraries. A large proportion of the phylotypes (25/62) that were distantly related to described fungal species appeared to be novel diversity. Ascomycota was the predominant group of fungi, with respect to both clone and phylotype number. Our results suggested there was the existence of cosmopolitan psychrophilic or psychrotolerant fungi in permafrost sediments, the community composition of fungi varied with increasing depth, while these communities largely distributed according to core layers.

AB  - Microorganisms were isolated from lignite freshly excavated in the Zahorie coal mine (southwestern Slovakia) under conditions excluding contamination with either soil or air-borne microorganisms. The isolates represented both Prokarya and Eukarya (fungi). All were able to grow on standard media, although some microorganisms were unstable and became extinct during storage of coal samples. Bacteria belonged to the genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Rhodococcus, according to both morphological criteria and ITS sequences. Several bacterial isolates were resistant to antibiotics. The presence of anaerobic bacteria was also documented, although they have not yet been identified. Fungal isolates were typified by using their ITS sequences. They belonged to the genera Trichoderma (Hypocrea), Penicillium, Epicoccum, Metarhizium (Cordyceps), and Cladosporium. Several fungi produced compounds with antibiotic action against standard bacterial strains. The evidence for the presence of microorganisms in native lignite was obtained by means of fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electron microprobe analysis. Results demonstrated that microorganisms were able to survive in the low-rank coal over a long time period. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Antarctic continent hosts heterogeneous regions, which are in general exposed to extreme conditions, mainly low temperatures. Thus, microorganisms that thrive in this environment are supposed to harbor a metabolic versatility of great biotechnological interest, which includes the production of cold-adapted enzymes. The present study aimed to investigate chitinase production by bacteria isolated from marine and terrestrial samples from the Maritime Antarctica. For this, a collection of 560 bacteria was evaluated. Seventy-three (13%) isolates, belonging to 13 bacterial genera affiliated to Proteobacteria (6), Actinobacteria (4) and Firmicutes (3), were positive in preliminary assays, and twenty strains were further selected based on individual plate assays at 5 and 15 degrees C. These strains were identified such as Arthrobacter psychrochitiniphilus, Arthrobacter cryoconite and Curto bacterium luteum, all belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria. The best chitinase producer was A. psychrochitiniphilus 492, which showed 43.39 U/L in 80 h of incubation. After optimization of nine independent variables by Plackett-Burman experimental design, followed by a fractional factorial (25-1) and a central composite design (CCD) 23, the best condition for chitinase production was achieved using yeast extract 1.0 g/L, NH4NO3 2.0 g/L, colloidal chitin 5.0% and initial pH 6.0, which allowed an increase of 7.7-fold in chitinase production as compared with the initial condition without optimiza tion. Results gathered herein reinforce the Antarctic environment as a rich source for chitinase prospecting and open perspectives for further optimization strategies aiming future biotechnological application of such molecules in ecologically-friendly and sustainable processes.

T2  - MYCOLOGIA
AB  - We molecularly assesed the ascomycetous fungal communities inhabiting the rhizoid environment of Cephaloziella varians, collected at Rothera Point on the western Antarctic Peninsula. The RFLP-phenotyped and cloned PCR products of a partial small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene were sequenced and analyzed with neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP). Both analyses identified four bootstrap-supported groups: (i) a sister group to Onygenales, (ii) a well-supported clade with Phialocephala fortinii, (iii) a large group of clones nested within Chaetothyriales, and (iv) a group nested within Eurotiales with a likely affinity to the genus Aspergillus. An additional marginally supported clade, including helotialean Hymenostyphus fructigenus, was detected in the NJ analysis. Placement of one clone (possibly helotialean) was not supported by either analysis. We included Hymenoscyphus ericae (Helotiales) in our analyses to test for its presence in clone libraries. None of our clones showed strongly supported affinity to H. ericae. The culture-independent technique proved useful for assessing the composition of rhizoid fungal communities, although it remains unknown whether any of these fungi colonize C varians tissues. Direct-community assays of this kind might be best combined with traditional isolation techniques to get a more holistic view of fungi occupying plant tissues.

T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Numerous studies have recognized a biogeographic boundary (i.e., Blakiston's Line) between Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan, where the Tsugaru Strait probably functions as a geographic barrier to the movement of terrestrial species. To clarify if this biogeographic boundary applies to soil microbes, we examined community structures of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi across the Tsugaru Strait. We sampled 266 soil cores from six conifer-dominated forests, and collected EM roots for fungal species identification based on internal transcribed spacer sequences. We found that EM fungal communities were primarily influenced by contemporary climate, but not significantly by the geographic barrier or spatial distance. Fungal OTUs appeared to be widespread in the Holarctic regions, suggesting long-distance dispersal capabilities or ancient migrations before the separation of Japanese islands from the continent. The significant effects of climate in this and previous studies imply that EM fungal communities may be sensitive to future climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

AB  - Mycena s.s. is a ubiquitous mushroom genus whose members degrade multiple dead plant substrates and opportunistically invade living plant roots. Having sequenced the nuclear genomes of 24 Mycena species, we find them to defy the expected patterns for fungi based on both their traditionally perceived saprotrophic ecology and substrate specializations. Mycena displayed massive genome expansions overall affecting all gene families, driven by novel gene family emergence, gene duplications, enlarged secretomes encoding polysaccharide degradation enzymes, transposable element (TE) proliferation, and horizontal gene transfers. Mainly due to TE proliferation, Arctic Mycena species display genomes of up to 502 Mbp (2-83 3 the temperate Mycena), the largest among mushroom-forming Agaricomycetes, indicating a possible evolutionary convergence to genomic expansions sometimes seen in Arctic plants. Overall, Mycena show highly unusual, varied mosaic-like genomic structures adaptable to multiple lifestyles, providing genomic illustration for the growing realization that fungal niche adaptations can be far more fluid than traditionally believed.

AB  - Simple Summary We investigated the environmental DNA fungal diversity present in cores of Oligocene rocks from Antarctica using a DNA metabarcoding approach. After eDNA extraction and analysis, we identified 198 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycota, Rozellomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Zoopagomycota, Aphelidiomycota (Fungi), and the fungal-like Oomycota (Stramenopila). The dominant taxa detected were Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Aspergillaceae sp., and Diaporthaceae sp. We also detected 22 fungal ASVs as intermediate and 170 as minor components of the assigned fungal diversity. The samples displayed a high fungal diversity; however, rarefaction analysis suggested that further diversity remains to be detected. The endolithic fungal community detected contains a rich and complex mycobiome comprising taxa with different lifestyles, comparable to the diversity reported in other Antarctic habitats. Our results suggest the need for further research to develop strategies for isolating these fungi into culture for evolutionary, physiological, and biogeochemical studies, and to assess their potential roles in biotechnological applications.Abstract In this study, we evaluated the fungal diversity present associated with cores of Oligocene rocks using a DNA metabarcoding approach. We detected 940,969 DNA reads grouped into 198 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) representing the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycota, Rozellomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Zoopagomycota, Aphelidiomycota (Fungi) and the fungal-like Oomycota (Stramenopila), in rank abundance order. Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Aspergillaceae sp. and Diaporthaceae sp. were assessed to be dominant taxa, with 22 fungal ASVs displaying intermediate abundance and 170 being minor components of the assigned fungal diversity. The data obtained displayed high diversity indices, while rarefaction indicated that the majority of the diversity was detected. However, the diversity indices varied between the cores analysed. The endolithic fungal community detected using a metabarcoding approach in the Oligocene rock samples examined contains a rich and complex mycobiome comprising taxa with different lifestyles, comparable with the diversity reported in recent studies of a range of Antarctic habitats. Due to the high fungal diversity detected, our results suggest the necessity of further research to develop strategies to isolate these fungi in culture for evolutionary, physiological, and biogeochemical studies, and to assess their potential role in biotechnological applications.

AB  - Primer selection and PCR methods can potentially lead to biased descriptions of microbial communities. Here, we investigated soil total fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community composition and diversity from diverse sites using several primers and amplification methods. The results showed that regardless of site, the ITS3tagmix1-5/ITS4ngs primer set generated a higher proportion of high-quality reads, targeted more fungal ASVs and revealed a higher total fungal alpha diversity compared to ITS3tagmix4/ITS4ngs. Among specific primers targeting the 18S rRNA gene, AMV4.5NF/AMDGR had differential specificity for Glomeraceae, whereas SSU515Fngs/Euk742R had differential specificity for Paraglomeraceae. Regardless of site, PCR approaches (nested vs non-nested) had higher influence on the AMF community structure than primer selection, though primer selection significantly influenced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi richness. Overall, the findings suggest that the specificity of amplification in relation to primer selection and PCR stringency should guide the best interpretation of fungal community diversity data from high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples.

AB  - Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) represents one of the two vascular plants that have colonized the Antarctic continent, which is usually exposed to extreme environmental conditions. In this work, we have characterized the endophytic fungi associated with the leaves of D. antarctica. Endophytic fungi were recovered from 91 individual plants from different points of Admiralty Bay at King George Island, Antarctica. A total of 26 fungal isolates were obtained from 273 leaf fragments. All isolates were identified by analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the rDNA. Alternaria and Phaeosphaeria were the most frequent genera associated with the plant. Other fungal isolates were identified as Entrophospora sp. and several undescribed Ascomycete species. An interesting result was obtained for the isolates UFMGCB 215 and UFMGCB 262, which were related to fungi associated with bryophytes present in boreal ecosystems. Some isolates showed low identity in the ITS sequences to sequences of fungal species deposited in GenBank, suggesting that these fungi could be new species. This work is the first report on fungal endophytes associated with leaves of the Antarctic grass D. antarctica.

T2  - MYCOSCIENCE
AB  - Rhizopogon (Boletales) is an ectomycorrhizal fungal genus that exhibits a strong specificity to Pinaceae. This strict association occurs almost exclusively with Pinus and Pseudotsuga, while associations with other genera in Pinaceae are inconclusive. Here, we describe Rhizopogon laricinus sp. nov. associated with Larix cajanderi distributed in northeastern Siberia, where forest fires are frequent. We confirmed the host identity by comparing rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences obtained from basidiomata and ectomycorrhizal root tips collected at the same sites. Morphological characteristics and molecular identification revealed that R. laricinus is a new species associated with Larix unequivocally. The molecular phylogeny based on ITS sequences placed this species sister to the subgenus Roseoli, which is specific to Pinus, and not to the Pseudotsuga-specific subgenus Villosuli. Thus, R. laricinus evolution does not correspond to host phylogeny as Larix and Pseudotsuga form a monophyletic Glade. Instead, ecological traits of Rhizopogon for adapting to disturbed habitats may have driven the host shift to Larix under high-frequency fire ecosystems. (C) 2019 The Mycological Society of Japan.

AB  - Spore-forming bacteria are known to produce various enzymes and bioproducts valuable to different industries and to bear the harsh conditions found in the Antarctic environment. However, aerobic or facultative spore-forming bacterial communities found in maritime Antarctic soils yet remain poorly studied. In this study, 80 spore-forming and cold-adapted bacterial strains were isolated from nine different soil samples of King George Island, in maritime Antarctica, and further clustered into amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis groups within each soil. Representative strains were then identified as belonging to Bacillus, Rummeliibacillus, Paenibacillus and Sporosarcina by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The ability to produce extracellular enzymes, antimicrobial substances and biosurfactants was determined in all isolates. The enzymatic activities most frequently found among the isolates were as follows: esterase (45 %), caseinase (30 %), amylase (16.2 %) and gelatinase (15 %). Biosurfactant production was detected in 25 % of the isolates. The growth inhibition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was observed in 13.7 % of the strains tested, but only two strains inhibited the growth of Candida albicans. The isolated spore-forming bacterial species were also compared with the characteristics of the different Antarctic soils sampled based on their physicochemical properties, showing that pH, C and P were the main factors correlated with the distribution of this group of bacteria in the Antarctic soils studied. These Antarctic endospore-forming bacterial strains may have a potential for industrial processes occurring at low temperatures.

T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - This work describes the distribution and diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of Colobanthus quitensis, a dicotyledonous plant that lives in Antarctica. A total of 188 fungal isolates were obtained from six different sites located across a 25.5-km transect through Admiralty Bay, at King George Island. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene was sequenced and the endophytic fungi were identified as species belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Cadophora, Davidiella, Entrophospora, Fusarium, Geomyces, Gyoerffyella, Microdochium, Mycocentrospora, and Phaeosphaeria. Davidiella tassiana was the prevalent species with 20.2% abundance. The endophytic fungal community showed low richness and high dominance indexes. Eleven endophytic taxa (58%) were fungi able to produce melanin in their hyphae, which may confer resistance against freezing temperatures and high rates of UV radiation and may increase their fitness in the extreme conditions of the Antarctic environment. In addition, phytopathogenic and decomposer species associated with healthy leaves of C. quitensis were found. The results obtained in this work show that C. quitensis is an interesting reservoir of saprobic and pathogenic fungal species, and could be a community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies, as well as studies of the adaptation mechanisms these microorganisms have to the extreme conditions in Antarctica.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a comparative screening between the nematophagous Antarctic fungus Arthrobotrys tortor and other species of that genus for the production of extracellular collagenases. The nematode species used in this study was Caenorhabditis elegans, feeding on Escherichia coli cultures. Determination of collagenase activity was made using insoluble collagen from bovine Achilles tendon and determining the amount of solubilized hydroxyproline produced. The results show that the total amount of collagenase produced by the Antarctic strain of A. tortor was about threefold higher than that observed for the other species. In the Antarctic strain, collagenase was shown to be a constitutive enzyme.

AB  - Filamentous fungi and yeasts associated with the marine algae Adenocystis utricularis, Desmarestia anceps, and Palmaria decipiens from Antarctica were studied. A total of 75 fungal isolates, represented by 27 filamentous fungi and 48 yeasts, were isolated from the three algal species and identified by morphological, physiological, and sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region and D1/D2 variable domains of the large-subunit rRNA gene. The filamentous fungi and yeasts obtained were identified as belonging to the genera Geomyces, Antarctomyces, Oidiodendron, Penicillium, Phaeosphaeria, Aureobasidium, Cryptococcus, Leucosporidium, Metschnikowia, and Rhodotorula. The prevalent species were the filamentous fungus Geomyces pannorum and the yeast Metschnikowia australis. Two fungal species isolated in our study, Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus and M. australis, are endemic to Antarctica. This work is the first study of fungi associated with Antarctic marine macroalgae, and contributes to the taxonomy and ecology of the marine fungi living in polar environments. These fungal species may have an important role in the ecosystem and in organic matter recycling.

T2  - NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Dispersal is a critical yet poorly understood factor underlying macroecological patterns in microbial communities(1). Airborne microbial transport is assumed to occupy a central role in determining dispersal outcomes(2,3), and extra-range dispersal has important implications for predicting ecosystem resilience and response to environmental changes. One of the most pertinent biomes in this regard is Antarctica, given its geographic isolation and vulnerability to climate change and human disturbances. Here, we report microbial diversity in near-ground and high-altitude air above the largest ice-free Antarctic habitat, as well as that of underlying soil microbial communities. We found that persistent local airborne inputs were unable to fully explain Antarctic soil community assembly. Comparison with airborne microbial diversity from high-altitude and non-polar sources suggests that strong selection occurs during long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of selection during airborne transit and at sink locations varied between microbial phyla. Overall, the communities from this isolated Antarctic ecosystem displayed limited connectivity to the non-polar microbial pool, and alternative sources of recruitment are necessary to fully explain extant soil diversity. Our findings provide critical insights into the role of airborne transport limitation in determining microbial biogeographic patterns.

AB  - Soil microbes produce an immense diversity of metabolites, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can shape the structure and function of microbial communities. VOCs mediate a multitude of microbe-microbe interactions, including antagonism. Despite their importance, the diversity and functional relevance of most microbial volatiles remain uncharacterized. We assembled a taxonomically diverse collection of 48 Actinobacteria isolated from soil and airborne dust and surveyed the VOCs produced by these strains on two different medium types in vitro using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We detected 126 distinct VOCs and structurally identified approximately 20% of these compounds, which were predominately C-1 to C-5 hetero-VOCs, including (oxygenated) alcohols, ketones, esters, and nitrogen-and sulfur-containing compounds. Each strain produced a unique VOC profile. While the most common VOCs were likely by-products of primary metabolism, most of the VOCs were strain specific. We observed a strong taxonomic and phylogenetic signal for VOC profiles, suggesting their role in finer-scale patterns of ecological diversity. Finally, we investigated the functional potential of these VOCs by assessing their effects on growth rates of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic pseudomonad strains. We identified sets of VOCs that correlated with growth inhibition and stimulation, information that may facilitate the development of microbial VOC-based pathogen control strategies. IMPORTANCE Soil microbes produce a diverse array of natural products, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Volatile compounds are important molecules in soil habitats, where they mediate interactions between bacteria, fungi, insects, plants, and animals. We measured the VOCs produced by a broad diversity of soil- and dust-dwelling Actinobacteria in vitro. We detected a total of 126 unique volatile compounds, and each strain produced a unique combination of VOCs. While some of the compounds were produced by many strains, most were strain specific. Importantly, VOC profiles were more similar between closely related strains, indicating that evolutionary and ecological processes generate predictable patterns of VOC production. Finally, we observed that actinobacterial VOCs had both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria that represent a plant-beneficial symbiont and a plant-pathogenic strain, information that may lead to the development of novel strategies for plant disease prevention.

AB  - The Antarctic continent is characterized by extreme conditions and encompasses peculiar environments which represent promising habitats for the recovery of well-adapted microorganisms with unique metabolic capabilities. Enzymatic activity combined to salinity and pH tolerance of bacteria that thrive in low temperature environment have attracted attention of researchers in recent years and, as scarce information on that topic is available, the aim of this study was to prospect bacteria isolated from Antarctic samples for extracellular amylase activity and to determine their salinity and pH tolerances. Ninety-one bacteria isolated from Antarctic environmental samples, including marine sponges and invertebrates, sediments and soil biofilm, were screened. Fourty-two isolates were selected as putative amylase producers based on their ability to produce clearing zones in agar plates. Eighty-six and forty-four isolates were able to grow at 5 and 10% NaCl concentrations, respectively. The best enzymatic activities for isolates 226 and 227 were 768.5 U dL 1 (20 degrees C) and 1410,16 U dL 1 (20 degrees C), respectively, both influenced by the temperature. All variables assayed showed statistically significant differences for isolates 227 and 226, demonstrating that enzyme activities respond differently to the applied conditions. This is the first report that describes the amylase activity from Carnobacterium and Psychrobacter strains isolated from Antarctic samples. These results encourage subsequent investigations of enzymes produced by microorganisms adapted to low temperatures and high osmolarity conditions, aiming future biotechnological application in pharmaceutical, textile or food industries.

T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING
AB  - The ste1 gene encoding a steryl esterase was isolated from the thermophilic fungus Melanocarpus albomyces. The gene has one intron, and it encodes a protein consisting of 576 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the steryl esterase was shown to be related to lipases and other esterases such as carboxylesterases. Formation of mature protein requires post-translational removal of a putative 18-amino-acid signal sequence and a 13-residue propeptide at the N-terminus. The intronless version of the Melanocarpus albomyces ste1 gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris under the inducible AOX1 promoter. The production level was low, and a large proportion of the total activity yield was found to be present intracellularly. However, the fact that steryl esterase activity was produced by P. pastoris cells carrying the expression cassette confirmed that the correct gene had been cloned. The stet gene was subsequently expressed in T reesei under the inducible cbh1 promoter, and a clearly higher production level was obtained. About 60% of the total activity was bound to the fungal mycelium or to solid components of the culture medium, or existed as aggregates. Triton X-100 was successfully used to recover this activity. The heterologous production system in T. reesei provides a means of producing M. albomyces steryl esterase STE1 reliably in large scale for future studies. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The BIOMEX project aims to test the ability of biomolecules and cell components to preserve their stability under space and Mars-like conditions, while at the same time investigating the survival capability of microorganisms. The experiment has been launched into space and is being exposed on the EXPOSE-R2 payload, outside of the International Space Station (ISS) over a time-span of 1.5 years. Along with a number of other extremophilic microorganisms, the Antarctic cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 has been included in the experiment. Before launch, dried colonies grown on Lunar and Martian regolith analogues were exposed to vacuum, irradiation and temperature cycles in ground based experiments (EVT1 and EVT2). Cultural and molecular tests revealed that the fungus survived on rock analogues under space and simulated Martian conditions, showing only slight ultra-structural and molecular damage.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Basal ice formation in the terrestrial snow cover is a common phenomenon in northern circumpolar areas, onehaving significant impacts on ecosystems, vegetation, animals and human activities. There is limited knowledge on the spatial and temporal occurrence of basal ice formation because of the sparse observation network and challenges involved in detecting formation events. We present a unique dataset on the annual extent of ice formation events in northern Finland between 1948 and 2016 based on reindeer herders' descriptions of the cold season in their management reports. In extreme years, basal ice can form over wide geographical extents. In approximately half of the herding districts studied, it occurred more frequently in the period 1983-2016 than in the period 1948-1982. Furthermore, five out of seven of the most extensive basal ice formation events (90th percentile) occurred between 1991 and 2016. Themost commonly reported processes related to ice formation were thaw or rain-on-snow events followed by freezing of the snow cover. Years with extensive basal ice formation were often characterized by above-average October-December air temperatures, air temperature variations around 0 degrees C and relatively high precipitation. However, basal ice did not occur during all warm and wet early winters, and formation events were generally weakly linked to the large-scale atmospheric teleconnections. Another risk factor for reindeer grazing associated with warm and rainy earlywinters is the growth of mycotoxin-producing molds below the snow. Approximately 24% of all reported mold formation events co-occurred with basal ice formation. The prevalence and frequency of basal ice formation events can be assessed based on our results. Ourwork contributes to understanding long-term fluctuations and changes in snow and ice conditions and the impacts of this variability in circumpolar areas.

AB  - Twenty-seven strains of basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia spp. were collected from lake sediment and soil surrounding the lakes in the Skarvsnes area, East Antarctica. Based on sequence similarity of their ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions and D1/D2 domains, the isolated strains were classified into three species; Mrakia blollopis (18 strains), M. gelida (7 strains), and M. robertii (2 strains). All of the strains produced ethanol from glucose at 10 degrees C. Six strains selected from the 27 isolates were then tested for ethanol fermentation and ethanol tolerance at 100 g/l glucose. Mrakia blollopis SK-4 and M. blollopis NRI-4 completely consumed the glucose within 13 d and 6 d of fermentation respectively, and demonstrated high ethanol yields and ethanol tolerance. In contrast, M. blollopis AGK-3 and M. blollopis TKG1-2 exhibited low ethanol yields and poor ethanol tolerance. These results indicate that ethanol yields of different Mrakia species may depend on ethanol tolerance in individual strains. (C) 2015 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - In the multifaceted soil habitat, predation is one of the most successful strategies for obtaining food. An example of prokaryotic predators is myxobacteria. Although the prey spectra of some myxobacteria have been the subject of numerous studies, these myxobacteria are usually rare in soils compared to other myxobacterial families. Consequently, predation assays featuring easily cultivable myxobacteria provide only limited information on the myxobacterial potential and their interactions with organisms in the soil. Therefore, the prey spectrum of representatives of more common families was tested and compared with members of the model family Myxococcaceae. In a newly developed assay, the extent of lysis was tested against various Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, as well as four yeasts. It was shown that Kofleria flava and Haliangium ochraceum have an equally diverse prey spectrum as the model genera Myxococcus and Corallococcus. However, less well-studied myxobacteria often lyse the prey colonies to a larger extent. Yeasts were lysed just as efficiently as bacteria. Furthermore, it was tested whether different myxobacteria can inhibit the growth of filamentous fungi. Almost every strain was able to prevent the spread of at least one fungus. H. ochraceum showed the highest activity and inhibited all fungi, including plant pathogenic Fusarium. These multiple interactions together with the high relative abundance in situ, suggest that myxobacteria, especially understudied families, could have a more important role in the soil food web than previously thought. The individual interaction spectra of the different myxobacteria provide only a glimpse at the complex relationships between the organisms in soil, which still remain understudied.

AB  - We assessed the diversity of culturable fungi associated with rocks of continental Antarctica to evaluate their physiological opportunistic virulence potential in vitro. The seventy fungal isolates obtained were identified as nine species of Acremonium, Byssochlamys, Cladosporium, Debaryomyces, Penicillium, and Rhodotorula. Acremonium sp., D. hansenii, P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, P. tardochrysogenum, and R. mucilaginosa were able to grow at 37 degrees C; in addition, B. spectabilis displayed a high level of growth at 37 and 45 degrees C. Thirty-one isolates of P. chrysogenum, P. citrinum, and P. tardochrysogenum were able to produce partial haemolysis on blood agar at 37 degrees C. Acremonium sp., P. citrinum, and P. tardochrysogenum showed spore sizes ranging from 2.81 to 5.13 mu m diameters at 37 degrees C. Of these, P. chrysogenum and P. tardochrysogenum displayed macro- and micro morphological polymorphism. Our results suggest that rocks of the ultra-extreme cold and dry environment of Antarctica harbour cryptic fungi phylogenetically close to opportunistic pathogenic and mycotoxigenic taxa with physiologic virulence characteristics in vitro.

AB  - Pseudomonas putida MCCC 1A00316 was originally isolated from an Antarctic soil and has demonstrated potential nematicidal activity. Thus, it has promising applications for the biological control of Meloidogyne incognita. The larval mortality and egg-hatching inhibition rates of M. incognita will increase with the rising concentration of culture filtrates of P. putida MCCC 1A00316 and the duration of exposure. Thus, this study aimed to separate, purify, and identify nematicidal compounds from P. putida MCCC 1A00316 and to validate their anti-M. incognita activities. Compounds were purified through silica gel column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Structural identification was conducted through liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, C-13-NMR, and Marfey's method. The isolated compounds were identified as cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) on the basis of the results of the above analyses and previously reported data. The effects of various concentrations of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) on the mortality rates of second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. incognita were investigated. Results showed that HPLC-purified cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) displayed nematicidal activities. The mortality rate of M. incognita J2 reached 84.3% after 72 h of exposure to 67.5 mg/L cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu). The lowest egg-hatching rate (9.74%) was observed after 8 days of incubation with 2000 mg/L cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu). An egg-hatching rate of 53.11% was obtained under the control treatment (sterile distilled water). However, cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu) did not elicit chemotaxis activity to M. incognita. This is the first work to investigate the anti-M. incognita characteristics of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu).

AB  - Two species of coniferous silicified wood are described from the El Freno Formation (Lower Jurassic) at Cerro La Brea, on the southern margin of the Atuel River, southern Mendoza Province, Argentina. Agathoxylon liguaensis Torres and Philippe (Araucariaceae) and the new species Podocarpoxylon atuelensis sp. nov. (Podocarpaceae) were described based on a detailed description of the secondary xylem. Wood specimens are well preserved, although some sections display variably decaying cell-walls typical of white-rotting by extant fungi. Vegetative and sexual structures in the degraded areas are identifiable as basidiomycetes. This is consistent with fungal saprotrophism and supports the role of fungi in the recycling of the organic matter in Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems. Considering the available geochronologic and biostratigraphic data and the current lithostratigraphic settings proposed for the unit, the age of the El Freno Formation at the studied locality can be constrained to the Hettangian-Sinemurian.

AB  - In northern forests, belowground sequestration of nitrogen (N) in complex organic pools restricts nutrient availability to plants. Oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi may aid plant N acquisition by providing access to N in macromolecular complexes. We test the hypotheses that ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species produce Mn-dependent peroxidases, and that the activity of these enzymes declines at elevated concentrations of inorganic N. In a boreal pine forest and a sub-arctic birch forest, Cortinarius DNA was assessed by 454-sequencing of ITS amplicons and related to Mn-peroxidase activity in humus samples with- and without previous N amendment. Transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes was investigated in field samples. Phylogenetic analyses of Cortinarius peroxidase amplicons and genome sequences were performed. We found a significant co-localization of high peroxidase activity and DNA from Cortinarius species. Peroxidase activity was reduced by high ammonium concentrations. Amplification of mRNA sequences indicated transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes under field conditions. The Cortinarius glaucopus genome encodes 11 peroxidases - a number comparable to many white-rot wood decomposers. These results support the hypothesis that some ectomycorrhizal fungi - Cortinarius species in particular - may play an important role in decomposition of complex organic matter, linked to their mobilization of organically bound N.

AB  - We characterized the fungal community found in the winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula. From the samples of snow, 234 fungal isolates were obtained and could be assigned to 51 taxa of 26 genera. Eleven yeast species displayed the highest densities; among them, Phenoliferia glacialis showed a broad distribution and was detected at all sites that were sampled. Fungi known to be opportunistic in humans were subjected to antifungal minimal inhibition concentration. Debaryomyces hansenii, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium sp. 3, and Penicillium sp. 4 displayed resistance against the antifungals benomyl and fluconazole. Among them, R. mucilaginosa isolates were able to grow at 37 degrees C. Our results show that the winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula contains a diverse fungal community dominated by cosmopolitan ubiquitous fungal species previously found in tropical, temperate, and polar ecosystems. The high densities of these cosmopolitan fungi suggest that they could be present in the air that arrives at the Antarctic Peninsula by air masses from outside Antarctica. Additionally, we detected environmental fungal isolates that were resistant to agricultural and clinical antifungals and able to grow at 37 degrees C. Further studies will be needed to characterize the virulence potential of these fungi in humans and animals.

AB  - Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated with high frequency from samples of ornithogenic soil collected from an Adelie penguin rookery at Hallet Station, Antarctica. While A. fumigatus has been well documented as the principal incitant of aspergillosis among penguins in captivity, this represents the 1st report of its presence in antarctic materials. A. flavus and A. ustus were also found in the Hallett samples. In a comparable number of soil and guano samples from isolated Adelie rookeries on Foyn Island and Possession Island, these fungi were not encountered. Their presence at Hallett Station may be the result of human contamination. A brief consideration of epidemiological implications is given.

AB  - . We expanded our knowledge of the Cladonia cariosa group by seeking out and sequencing squamulose epodetiate Cladonia specimens in western North America. Cladonia galindezii, a species in the Cladonia cariosa group with large squamules forming thick mats and often containing porphyrilic acid, as in the type specimen from Antarctica, was found in several western states, new to the United States. In the same clade were specimens with atranorin only or atranorin with norstictic acid. We also establish Cladonia andereggii as another species in the C. cariosa group, from Idaho and Washington, based on sequencing new specimens from near the type locality. Although C. andereggii resembles C. symphycarpa in having norstictic acid-containing medium-sized squamules, ITS sequences of C. andereggii showed that it is more closely related to C. cariosa than to C. symphycarpa. We also demonstrated chemical diversity in the remainder of the C. cariosa group in western North America, with five chemotypes, all with atranorin, most frequently with atranorin only, less frequently with porphyrilic acid, homosekikaic acid, norstictic acid, or fumarprotocetraric acid, some of these in combination with rangiformic acid. While C. andereggii consistently contained norstictic acid and atranorin, C. galindezii and the remainder of C. cariosa s.l. varied in major substances.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS
AB  - Lipases have applications for the industrial processing of lipids, including concentrating and/or modifying fish oil derived omega-3 fatty acids, widely used as nutritional supplement and functional food ingredients. A range of para-nitrophenol (pNP) acyl esters were synthesised as a means to rapidly screen lipases for fatty acid selectivity using spectrophotometric detection. The chosen esters were based primarily on the most abundant fatty acids present in anchovy and tuna oils. pNP derivatives of C16:1 n-7, C18:1 n-9 (OA), C18:2 n-6 (LA), C18:3 n-3 (ALA), C20:5 n-3 (EPA) and C22:6 n-3 (DMA) were synthesised. Storage stability of these pNP derivatives was shown to be at least 6 months and all pNP derivatives, including those of EPA and DHA, were shown to be stable throughout the conditions of the assay. We applied the new assay substrates for the determination of fatty acid selectivity of five widely utilised lipases. Results showed that the lipase from Candida rugosa was the most selective in terms of omega-3 specificity, preferentially hydrolysing all other medium long-chain substrates. Lipases from Rhizomucor miehei and Thermomyces lanuginosa also showed selectivity, with a significant preference for saturated fatty acids. Candida antarctica lipase B and Aspergillus niger lipase were the least selective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Antarctic cryptoendolithic fungi of the ice-free desert could have evolved genetically and geographically isolated since the separation of the Continent from the Gondwanaland. The resulting harsh environmental conditions due to the migration of Antarctica to the South Pole led to a strong selective pressure possibly promoting adaptive radiation and speciation. Microorganisms evolved during this unique process are adapted to colonize what is known as the closest Martian environment on Earth. For this reason they have been already suggested as the best eukaryotic model for exobiological speculations. The results on freeze and thawing, UV exposure and osmotic stress tolerance here reported highlight an uncommon ability of surviving under these external pressures. Studies on their ability to withstand space conditions are in progress in view of the opportunity of direct space exposure on the International Space Station. The results could give new tools to solve the conflict concerning the Panspermia hypothesis. (c) 2007 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dust has been widely recognised as an important source of nutrients in the marine environment and as a vector for transporting pathogenic microorganisms. Disturbingly, in the wake of a dust storm event along the eastern Australian coast line in 2009, the Continuous Plankton Recorder collected masses of fungal spores and mycelia (∼150,000 spores/m(3)) forming a floating raft that covered a coastal area equivalent to 25 times the surface of England. Cultured A. sydowii strains exhibited varying metabolite profiles, but all produced sydonic acid, a chemotaxonomic marker for A. sydowii. The Australian marine fungal strains share major metabolites and display comparable metabolic diversity to Australian terrestrial strains and to strains pathogenic to Caribbean coral. Secondary colonisation of the rafts by other fungi, including strains of Cladosporium, Penicillium and other Aspergillus species with distinct secondary metabolite profiles, was also encountered. Our bioassays revealed that the dust-derived marine fungal extracts and known A. sydowii metabolites such as sydowic acid, sydowinol and sydowinin A adversely affect photophysiological performance (F-v/F-m) of the coral reef dinoflagellate endosymbiont Symbiodinium. Different Symbiodinium clades exhibited varying sensitivities, mimicking sensitivity to coral bleaching phenomena. The detection of such large amounts of A. sydowii following this dust storm event has potential implications for the health of coral environments such as the Great Barrier Reef.

TI  - Evolutionary origins of Antarctic microbiota: invasion, selection and endemism
AU  - Vincent, WF
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
AB  - Increasing interest in the ecological roles, conservation and biotechnological potential of Antarctic microbiota has focused attention on their biodiversity and evolutionary origins. Antarctic microbial ecosystems provide useful models for general questions in evolutionary ecology given the relative isolation of the South Polar Region, the severe biological constraints imposed by the polar environment, and the absence of higher plants and animals in some Antarctic habitats. Sealed environments such as Lake Vostok and the overlying East Antarctic ice sheet provide unique, natural culture collections for studying microorganisms that have been isolated from the global gene pool over timescales of evolutionary significance. Most Antarctic environments, however, continue to receive microbial propagules from outside the region, as indicated by spore trap data, the microflora found in Antarctic snow and ice, the colonising taxa at geothermal sites, and the high frequency of apparently cosmopolitan species in most habitats. Differences in environmental stability and selection pressure among environments are likely to influence the degree of adaptive radiation and microbial endemism. The latter seems greater in the Southern Ocean by comparison with non-marine ecosystems of Antarctica, although there is some evidence of endemic species in highly specialised niches on the continent such. as in the endolithic habitat and saline lakes. Analytical techniques such as 16S rDNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridisation are beginning to provide new insights into the genetic affinities and biodiversity of Antarctic microbiota, and are leading to a more rigorous evaluation of microbial endemism.

T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
AB  - The Antarctic continent harbors unique ecosystems, including diverse microbial communities inhabiting rocky substrates. Despite extensive research on Antarctic microbial ecology, a gap in knowledge persists regarding the comparative analysis of microbial communities associated with Antarctic granite rocks and the microenvironment created by the thalli of the epilithic lichens growing on them. The present study addresses this gap. Using high-throughput sequencing approaches we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of fungal and bacterial communities colonizing endolithic and epilithic niches on granites in Antarctica. Our results revealed distinct differences between endolithic and epilithic communities in terms of diversity and composition. Lecanoromycetes was the most frequent fungal class in both groups, which accounts for 78.5% in the endolithic and 53.5% in the epilithic samples, respectively. The prevalence of lichenized fungi in both habitats suggests their pivotal role in shaping the diversity and composition of the Antarctic microbial communities. Endolithic communities exhibited higher bacterial diversity, most probably influenced by a combination of environmental factors and the complex interplay between lichens and other microorganisms. Stress-resistant bacterial taxa, as the radioresistant Truepera and Rubrobacter species were specifically found in the endolithically colonized specimens, suggesting that the endolithic lifestyle promotes a more specific ability to adapt throughout environmental extremes. Moreover, the endolithic niche in granites seems to positively select cyanobacteria, as they were found to play a significant role in endolithic communities, demonstrating their adaptability to low-light conditions and their importance in nutrient cycling. Overall, our findings shed light on the ecological dynamics of microbial communities in extreme environments and highlight the importance of further research to elucidate their roles in Antarctic ecosystems.

AB  - The evaluation of fungal root endophytes of two multizonal mountain plant species (Soldanella carpatica and Homogyne alpine) in relation to altitude was conducted. The comparison of root colonization by coarse arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM F) and the fine AMF endophyte (Glomus tenue), as well as the presence of dark septate endophytes (DSE) were assessed along altitudinal gradients (1000-2050 m a.s.l.) oil calcareous and non-calcareous substrata in the Tatra Mts. (Western Carpathians). Additionally, AMF species composition in the rhizosphere of the investigated plants was determined. Coarse AMIF dominated over the fine endophyte in roots of S. carpatica and H. alpina, In the case of S. carpatica, there was a tendency for coarse AMF colonization decline with increasing altitude, while the reverse trend wits observed for the fine endophyte. In contrast, the altitudinal patterns of the two types were opposite in H. alpina. Fifteen AMF species associated with the rhizosphere of'S. carpatica were identified at the sites located in the Western Tatra Mountains, whereas spores of only our species were isolated from the rhizosphere of H. alpina in the High Tatra Mountains. None of the identified AMF species was observed to occur both in the High and Western Tatra Mts. DSE accompanied AMF in the roots of S. carpatica and H. alpina at each site: however, the root colonization by this group Of fungi was low. The DSE colonization did not have a consistent relationship with altitude in both plant species. The results suggest that at the investigated altitudes factors such as the type Of Substrata, host plants, and local plant species composition may play a more important role in determining root colonization as well as the establishment of a local AMF Community than the climatic changes with increasing elevation above sea level.

AB  - We evaluated the diversity and distribution of viable fungi present in permafrost and active layers obtained from three islands of Maritime Antarctica. A total of 213 fungal isolates were recovered from the permafrost, and 351 from the active layer, which were identified in 58 taxa; 27 from permafrost and 31 from the active layer. Oidiodendron, Penicillium, and Pseudogymnoascus taxa were the most abundant in permafrost. Bionectriaceae, Helotiales, Mortierellaceae, and Pseudeurotium were the most abundant in the active layer. Only five shared both substrates. The yeast Mrakia blollopis represented is the first reported on Antarctic permafrost. The fungal diversity detected was moderate to high, and composed of cosmopolitan, cold-adapted, and endemic taxa, reported as saprobic, mutualistic, and parasitic species. Our results demonstrate that permafrost shelters viable fungi across the Maritime Antarctica, and that they are contrasting to the overlying active layer. We detected important fungal taxa represented by potential new species, particularly, those genetically close to Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which can cause extinction of bats in North America and Eurasia. The detection of viable fungi trapped in permafrost deserves further studies on the extension of its fungal diversity and its capability to expand from permafrost to other habitats in Antarctica, and elsewhere.

AB  - Jurassic hot-spring chert deposits in the Deseado Massif, Patagonia, Argentina, have been known for over two decades, but the associated biota has only begun to be documented recently, and thus far only from a small number of localities. Here we report the discovery of a large complex of well-exposed Upper Jurassic epithermal siliceous deposits represented by organic-rich cherts preserved within the geothermal system from La Bajada, Santa Cruz, Argentina. The chert samples analyzed so far contain exceptionally well-preserved, in situ and transported, tri-dimensionally silicified plants, animals and microorganisms. Plants include equisetaleans (Equisetum thermale), ferns and gymnosperms. Among them, well-preserved in situ osmundaceous rhizomes in different developmental stages are the dominant component of the taphoflora. Conifers are represented by wood, seeds, leaves and pollen tentatively assigned to the families Araucariaceae and Cheirolepidiaceae. The assemblage also contains vegetative and reproductive structures of fungi, oomycetes, cyanobacteria, algae, testate amoebas, ciliates and numerous remains of unresolved taxonomic affinity. Microorganisms are preserved isolated in the chert matrix or directly associated with plants and other organic remains in mutualistic, parasitic and saprotrophic engagements. Also present are numerous coprolites and arthropod remains that, along with the named microorganisms, are indicative of trophic relationships in the ecosystem. Altogether, this fossil assemblage suggests that distal paleoenvironments within the geothermal system are preserved at La Bajada. The diversity, abundance, and exceptional preservation of fossils in the La Bajada ecosystem provides a unique window into the geological past that offers a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of middle Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems.

T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Unraveling functional genes related to biodegradation of organic compounds has profoundly improved our understanding of biological remediation processes, yet the ecology of such genes is only poorly understood. We used a culture-independent approach to assess the abundance and diversity of bacteria catalyzing the degradation of n-alkanes with a chain length between C(5) and C(16) at a forest site co-contaminated with mineral oil hydrocarbons and metals for nearly 60 years. The alkB gene coding for a rubredoxin-dependent alkane monooxygenase enzyme involved in the initial activation step of aerobic aliphatic hydrocarbon metabolism was used as biomarker. Within the area of study, four different zones were evaluated: one highly contaminated, two intermediately contaminated, and a noncontaminated zone. Contaminant concentrations, hydrocarbon profiles, and soil microbial respiration and biomass were studied. Abundance of n-alkane-degrading bacteria was quantified via real-time PCR of alkB, whereas genetic diversity was examined using molecular fingerprints (T-RFLP) and clone libraries. Along the contamination plume, hydrocarbon profiles and increased respiration rates suggested on-going natural attenuation at the site. Gene copy numbers of alkB were similar in contaminated and control areas. However, T-RFLP-based fingerprints suggested lower diversity and evenness of the n-alkane-degrading bacterial community in the highly contaminated zone compared to the other areas; both diversity and evenness were negatively correlated with metal and hydrocarbon concentrations. Phylogenetic analysis of alkB denoted a shift of the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community from Gram-positive bacteria in the control zone (most similar to Mycobacterium and Nocardia types) to Gram-negative genotypes in the contaminated zones (Acinetobacter and alkB sequences with little similarity to those of known bacteria). Our results underscore a qualitative rather than a quantitative response of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria to the contamination at the molecular level.

AB  - Antarctica is one of the most suitable locations for the bioprospecting of psychrotrophic fungi, which play a key role in the nutrient cycle and organic material mineralization in cold environments. These actions mainly take place via the production of several cold-active extracellular enzymes. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of filamentous fungi from King George Island (25 De Mayo Island), Antarctica and their ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes at low temperatures. A total of 51 fungal isolates were obtained from 31 samples. Twelve genera were identified, with seven among the Ascomycota (Cadophora, Helotiales, Monographella, Oidodendron, Penicillium, Phialocephala, Phialophora, Phoma and Pseudogymnoascus), one Basidiomycota (Irpex) and two Mucoromycota (Mortierella and Mucor). Monographella lycopodina and Mucor zonatus, not previously reported in Antarctica, were identified. Nine isolates could not be identified to genus level and may represent novel species. Most of the studied fungi were psychrotrophic (76.5%). Nevertheless, only five isolates were able to grow at 35 degrees C, 15 degrees C being the optimal growth temperature for 65% of the fungal isolates. Results from enzyme production at low temperature revealed that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse fungi, which represent potential tools for biotechnological applications in cold regions.

AB  - Endolithic growth within rocks is a critical adaptation of microbes living in harsh environments where exposure to extreme temperature, radiation, and desiccation limits the predominant life forms, such as in the ice-free regions of Continental Antarctica. The microbial diversity of the endolithic communities in these areas has been sparsely examined. In this work, diversity and composition of bacterial assemblages in the cryptoendolithic lichen-dominated communities of Victoria Land (Continental Antarctica) were explored using a high-throughput metabarcoding approach, targeting the V4 region of 16S rDNA. Rocks were collected in 12 different localities (from 14 different sites), along a gradient ranging from 1000 to 3300 m a.s.l. and at a sea distance ranging from 29 to 96 km. The results indicate Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are the dominant taxa in all samples and defined a `core' group of bacterial taxa across all sites. The structure of bacteria communities is correlated with the fungal counterpart and among the environmental parameters considered, altitude was found to influence bacterial biodiversity, while distance from sea had no evident influence.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY
AB  - Coccomyxa Schmidle (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) is a genus of green microalgae that has worldwide distribution, with representatives found in a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Members of this taxon can be free-living and/or associated with other organisms, establishing different types of relationships (e.g. parasitic, symbiotic). The most frequent organisms forming associations with Coccomyxa are fungi and marine animals, most importantly mussels. Moreover, there is a well-documented association between a Coccomyxa strain and Gingko biloba and some Coccomyxa-like microalgae have been found in the bark of other trees. Here we describe a green algal strain found in association with carnivorous plants of the genus Drosera L. The systematics of Coccomyxa based only on classical methods is problematic, due to the very simple morphology of the genus and its high phenotypic plasticity. Therefore, the microalga associated with Drosera plants was isolated, maintained in culture and subjected to an integrative taxonomy approach, including morphological, ultrastructural and molecular analyses, along with ecological considerations. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the rbcL and 18S rRNA genes and molecular data obtained from the ITS2 spacer, including both sequence and secondary structure analyses, showed that the investigated microorganism belonged to a lineage distinct from those sequenced so far. An accurate taxonomic comparison between the microalga associated with Drosera and each of the species already described for the genus Coccomyxa was also carried out, considering morphology, ultrastructure and ecology. The results as a whole allowed us to erect a new species inside the genus Coccomyxa: Coccomyxa cimbrica K.Sciuto, B.Baldan & I.Moro

T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Antarctica has been successfully colonized by microorganisms despite presenting adverse conditions for life such as low temperatures, high solar radiation, low nutrient availability and dryness. Although these “cold-loving” microorganisms are recognized as primarily responsible for nutrient and organic matter recycling/mineralization, the yeasts, in particular, remain poorly characterized and understood. The aim of this work was to study the yeast microbiota in soil and water samples collected on King George Island. Results: A high number of yeast isolates was obtained from 34 soil and 14 water samples. Molecular analyses based on rDNA sequences revealed 22 yeast species belonging to 12 genera, with Mrakia and Cryptococcus genera containing the highest species diversity. The species Sporidiobolus salmonicolor was by far the most ubiquitous, being identified in 24 isolates from 13 different samples. Most of the yeasts were psychrotolerant and ranged widely in their ability to assimilate carbon sources (consuming from 1 to 27 of the 29 carbon sources tested). All species displayed at least 1 of the 8 extracellular enzyme activities tested. Lipase, amylase and esterase activity dominated, while chitinase and xylanase were less common. Two yeasts identified as Leuconeurospora sp. and Dioszegia fristingensis displayed 6 enzyme activities. Conclusions: A high diversity of yeasts was isolated in this work including undescribed species and species not previously isolated from the Antarctic region, including Wickerhamomyces anomalus, which has not been isolated from cold regions in general. The diversity of extracellular enzyme activities, and hence the variety of compounds that the yeasts may degrade or transform, suggests an important nutrient recycling role of microorganisms in this region. These yeasts are of potential use in industrial applications requiring high enzyme activities at low temperatures.

T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Located 1140 km from the South American coastline in the South Atlantic Ocean and with an age of 4 million years, Trindade Island is the most recent volcanic component of Brazilian territory. Its original native vegetation has been severely damaged by human influence, in particular through the introduction of exotic grazing animals such as goats. However, since the complete eradication of goats and other feral animals in the late 1990s, the island's vegetation has been recovering, and even some endemic species that had been considered extinct have been rediscovered. In this study, we set out to characterize the contemporary cryptic diversity in soils of the recovering native forest of Trindade Island using metabarcoding by high throughput sequencing (HTS). The sequence diversity obtained was dominated by microorganisms, including three domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) and five kingdoms (Fungi, Metazoa, Protozoa, Chromista, and Viridiplantae). Bacteria were represented by 20 phyla and 116 taxa, with Archaea by only one taxon. Fungi were represented by seven phyla and 250 taxa, Viridiplantae by five phyla and six taxa, Protozoa by five phyla and six taxa, Metazoa by three phyla and four taxa and Chromista by two phyla and two taxa. Even after the considerable anthropogenic impacts and devastation of the island's natural forest, our sequence data reveal the presence of a rich and complex diversity of microorganisms, invertebrates, and plants and provide important baseline biodiversity information that will contribute to ecological restoration efforts on the island.

T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
AB  - The linear growth rates of fungal isolates were measured on agar plates at temperatures ranging from 4.degree. to 35.degree. C. Fungi tested included the major fungal colonizers of leaves and litter of the three dominant plant species on subantarctic Macquarie Island, and major fungal species associated with plant and soil communities near Australia”s Casey Station on the Antarctic Continent. All fungi grew at 4.degree. C and were classified as psychrotrophs. Maximum growth rates were recorded at temperatures of 10.degree. to 20.degree. C for 13 of the 15 isolates from Macquarie Island and for all six isolates from Casey. Most of the leaf colonizing fungi from Macquarie Island had optimum growth temperatures of 15.degree. C whereas all litter fungi from Macquarie Island and Casey fungi except Thelebolus microsporus had optimum growth temperatures of 20.degree. C or above. Maximum growth of all species was at temperatures above those normally prevailing in their natural enviroments, with most species growing at 4.degree. C at between 10% and 30% of their maximum rates. However, microclimatic effects have resulted at times in temperatures near their growth optima. The highest growth rates at 4.degree. C were recorded for Phoma spp. 1 and 2, Phoma exigua and Mortierella gamsii from Macquarie Island and Mortierella sp. 1 from Casey. Thelebolus microsporus and sterile sp. G from Casey also grew relatively fast at 4.degree.C, and these species, and Phoma sp. 3 and Phoma exigua from Macquarie Island had the lowest Q-10 values for the temperature range 4.degree. to 15.degree. C.

AB  - A comparative study of the bacteria occurring in soils of montane grasslands, montane forests, subalpine forests and alpine tundra habitats was conducted to ascertain the types of bacterial metabolic or enzymatic activities in the soils of these ecosystems. Elevation substantially affected taxa isolated. Amylolytic, cellulolytic and pectinolytic activity was observed in cultured isolates from all areas. Proteolytic activity was not observed in isolates from alpine tundra but was observed in cultures isoalted from all other areas. Microbial population sizes remained constant with increased elevation but organismic diversity decreased. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria were isolated from all ecosystems studied. Free-living N-fixing organisms were isolated in large numbers from all areas except the alpine tundra. Rapid degradation of cellulose seems to be the result of a cooperative effect between bacteria and fungi in alpine tundra soils.

AB  - Worldwide glaciers are annually retreating due to global overheating and this phenomenon determines the potential lost of microbial diversity represented by psychrophilic microbial population sharing these peculiar habitats. In this context, yeast strains, all unable to grow above 20A degrees C, consisting of 42 strains from Antarctic soil and 14 strains isolated from Alpine Glacier, were isolated and grouped together based on similar morphological and physiological characteristics. Sequences of the D1/D2 and ITS regions of the ribosomal DNA confirmed the previous analyses and demonstrated that the strains belong to unknown species. Three new species are proposed: Mrakia robertii sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8912), Mrakia blollopis sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8921) and a related anamorphic species Mrakiella niccombsii sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8917). Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region revealed that the new proposed species were closely related to each other within the Mrakia clade in the order Cystofilobasidiales, class Tremellomycetes. The Mrakia clade now contains 8 sub-clades. Teliospores were observed in all strains except CBS 8918 and for the Mrakiella niccombsii strains.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Surfactants are used to enhance the bioavailability of recalcitrant residual petroleum contamination during bioremediation. However, surfactants in some cases inhibit biodegradation, which is often attributed to their toxicity. Herein, we showthat a rhamnolipid biosurfactant likely served as a carbon source and exhibited physiological inhibition on petroleum biodegradation. The addition of biosurfactants in mixed, batch, slurry bioreactors with soils from a petroleum-contaminated site led to a dose-dependent shift in the microbial community with a decrease in diversity and increase in population size and delayed biodegradation. Microbial community analysis indicated the enrichment of Alphaproteobacteria affiliated taxa such as Sphingomonadaceae in systems amended with biosurfactant. The diversitywas significantly lower in systemswith higher doses of biosurfactants compared to systems without biosurfactant. Droplet Digital PCR indicated a 30-90 fold increase in 16S rRNA copy numbers in systemswith higher doses of biosurfactant than control systemswithout surfactant and nutrients, whereas the nutrient amendment alone led to a two-fold increase in population size. Total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis showed that the biodegradation extent was negatively impacted by rhamnolipid at the highest dose compared to lower doses (23% vs. 40%) or without the biosurfactant. Indigenous isolates cultivated from the oil-amended soil exhibited growth on rhamnolipid as a sole carbon source. A novel insight gained is how dose-dependent responses of microbial communities to biosurfactants alter the biodegradation time profile of hydrocarbons. The study highlights the significance ofmicrobial assessment prior to surfactant-mediated bioremediation practices. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diversity of lichen-associated bacteria from lichen taxa Cetraria, Cladonia, Megaspora, Pseudephebe, Psoroma, and Sphaerophorus was investigated by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Physiological characteristics of the cultured bacterial isolates were investigated to understand possible roles in the lichen ecosystem. Proteobacteria (with a relative abundance of 69.7-96.7%) were mostly represented by the order Rhodospirillales. The 117 retrieved isolates were grouped into 35 phylotypes of the phyla Actinobacteria (27), Bacteroidetes (6), Deinococcus-Thermus (1), and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria (53), Betaproteobacteria (18), and Gammaproteobacteria (12)). Hydrolysis of macromolecules such as skim milk, polymer, and (hypo)xanthine, solubilization of inorganic phosphate, production of phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid, and fixation of atmospheric nitrogen were observed in different taxa. The potential phototrophy of the strains of the genus Polymorphobacter which were cultivated from a lichen for the first time was revealed by the presence of genes involved in photosynthesis. Altogether, the physiological characteristics of diverse bacterial taxa from Antarctic lichens are considered to imply significant roles of lichen-associated bacteria to allow lichens to be tolerant or competitive in the harsh Antarctic environment.

TI  - A Review and Analysis of Rangeland and Wildland Soil Health
AU  - Williams, Stephen E.
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Soil health is focused on intensively managed (IM) soils (often farmed soils), by-passing extensively managed (EM) soils (range lands, deserts, shrub lands, tundra). High economic value products are generated by IM systems. Many EM lands are of cultural, recreational, scenic, or scientific value. However, and despite the fact that they provide forage for domestic and wild animals, they are not always of high economic value. IM and EM soils are evaluated on the same health scales. The contention herein is all soils formed under soil state conditions under the absence of human interventions are inherently healthy. But a given soil has dynamic properties that determine its management as IM or EM. An EM sagebrush steppe soil may be deemed unhealthy as a result of low organic matter and short growing season. An IM grassland steppe soil is healthy as a result of high organic matter and a long growing season. The sagebrush soil, however, provides habitat for culturally important sage grouse. The grassland soil may provide, when plowed, habitat for economically important soybeans. Soil taxonomies can be used to establish inherent health of undisturbed soils. Determining a soil's dynamic nature is a different construct. Here, four different sets of EM soils were evaluated to showcase their diversity, evaluate levels of health and display their often-unconventional dynamic characteristics. An argument is made that a soil's health, an inherent condition, is not the same as its dynamic condition (potential to produce goods and services). Soil health changes are usually slowly driven by soil state factors but can be dramatically changed by humans. Otherwise, soil health can be viewed as a near constant ecosystem attribute. The dynamic nature of soils change according to needs placed by humans. EM soils may be healthy but lack attention since their dynamic nature is not traditional and often of low economic value. Evaluation of soil health and dynamic value on EM lands is often exacerbated by information absence. Strategies to circumvent this include sampling design, reference sites and standardized ways of EM soil health determination. A case is made that baselines of soil health can be taken from soil surveys, taxonomic names, and soil data from map units, where such information exists. Certified supplementary information is ambiguously available, but may be crucial. Outdoor living laboratories that feature inherent soil health and dynamic soil alternatives may help circumvent information voids.

AB  - Bulk paleosol samples collected from a Middle to Early Miocene moraine in the New Mountain area of the Dry Valleys, Antarctica, yielded Coleoptera exoskeletons and occasional endoskeletons showing considerable diagenetic effects along with several species of bacteria, all lodged in a dry-frozen but salt-rich horizon at shallow depth to the land surface. The till is at the older end of a chronologic sequence of glacial deposits, thought to have been deposited before the transition from wet-based to cold-based ice (similar to 15 Ma), and hence, entirely weathered in contact with the subaerial atmosphere. It is possible, though not absolutely verifiable, that the skeletons date from this early stage of emplacement having undergone modifications whenever light snowmelt occurred or salt concentrations lowered the freezing temperature to maintain water as liquid. Correlation of the Coleoptera species with cultured bacteria in the sample and the likelihood of co-habitation with Beauveria bassiani found in two adjacent, although younger paleosols, leads to new questions about the antiquity of the Coleoptera and the source of N and glucose from chitinase derived from the insects. The skeletons in the 831 section may date close to the oldest preserved chitin (Oligocene) yet found on Earth. While harsh Martian conditions make it seemingly intolerable for complex, multicellular organisms such as insects to exist in the near-surface and subaerially, life within similar cold, dry paleosol microenvironments (Cryosols) of Antarctica point to life potential for the Red Planet, especially when considering the relatively diverse microbe (bacteria and fungi) population.

T2  - CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS OF LIPIDS
AB  - Shape and physico-chemical properties of the scissile fatty acid binding sites of six lipases and two serine esterases were analyzed and compared in order to understand the molecular basis of substrate specificity. All eight serine esterases and lipases have similar architecture and catalytic mechanism of ester hydrolysis, but different substrate specificities for the acyl moiety. Lipases and esterases differ in the geometry of their binding sites, lipases have a large, hydrophobic scissile fatty acid binding site, esterases like acetylcholinesterase and bromoperoxidase have a small acyl binding pocket, which fits exactly to their favorite substrates. The lipases were subdivided into three sub-groups: (1) lipases with a hydrophobic, crevice-like binding site located near the protein surface (lipases from Rhizomucor and Rhizopus); (2) lipases with a funnel-like binding site (lipases from Candida antarctica, Pseudomonas and mammalian pancreas and cutinase); and (3) lipases with a tunnel-like binding site (lipase from Candida rugosa). The length of the scissile fatty acid binding site varies considerably among the lipases between 7.8 Angstrom in cutinase and 22 Angstrom in Candida rugosa and Rhizomucor miehei lipase. Location and properties of the scissile fatty acid binding sites of all lipases of known structure were characterized. Our model also identifies the residues which mediate chain length specificity and thus may guide protein engineering of lipases for changed chain length specificity. The model was supported by published experimental data on the chain length specificity profile of various lipases and on mutants of fungal lipases with changed fatty acid chain length specificity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes at low temperature of yeasts isolated from 25 de Mayo island, Antarctica, and to identify those exhibiting one or more of the evaluated enzymatic activities. A total of 105 yeast isolates were obtained from different samples and 66 were identified. They belonged to 12 basidiomycetous and four ascomycetous genera. Most of the isolates were ascribed to the genera Cryptococcus, Mrakia, Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, Gueomyces, Phenoliferia, Leucosporidium, and Pichia. Results from enzymes production at low temperatures revealed that the Antarctic environment contains metabolically diverse cultivable yeasts, which represent potential tools for biotechnological applications. While most the isolates proved to produce 2-4 of the investigated exoenzymes, two of them evidenced the six evaluated enzymatic activities: Pichia caribbica and Guehomyces pullulans, which were characterized as psycrotolerant and psycrophilic, respectively. In addition, P. caribbica could assimilate several n-alkanes and diesel fuel. The enzyme production profile and hydrocarbons assimilation capacity, combined with its high level of biomass production and the extended exponential growth phase make P. caribbica a promising tool for cold environments biotechnological purposes in the field of cold-enzymes production and oil spills bioremediation as well.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Fluctuations in climate and edaphic factors influence field decomposition rates and preclude a complete understanding of how microbial communities respond to plant litter quality. In contrast, laboratory microcosms isolate the intrinsic effects of litter chemistry and microbial community from extrinsic effects of environmental variation. Used together, these paired approaches provide mechanistic insights to decomposition processes. In order to elucidate the microbial mechanisms underlying how environmental conditions alter the trajectory of decay, we characterized microbial biomass, respiration, enzyme activities, and nutrient dynamics during early (<10% mass loss), mid- (10-40% mass loss), and late (>40% mass loss) decay in parallel field and laboratory litter bag incubations for deciduous tree litters with varying recalcitrance (dogwood < maple < maple-oak mixture < oak). In the field, mass loss was minimal (<10%) over the first 50 days (January February), even for labile litter types, despite above-freezing soil temperatures and adequate moisture during these winter months. In contrast, microcosms displayed high C mineralization rates in the first week. During mid-decay, the labile dogwood and maple litters in the field had higher mass loss per unit enzyme activity than the lab, possibly due to leaching of soluble compounds. Microbial biomass to litter mass (B:C) ratios peaked in the field during late decay, but B:C ratios declined between mid- and late decay in the lab. Thus, microbial biomass did not have a consistent relationship with litter quality between studies. Higher oxidative enzyme activities in oak litters in the field, and higher nitrogen (N) accumulation in the lab microcosms occurred in late decay. We speculate that elevated N suppressed fungal activity and/or biomass in microcosms. Our results suggest that differences in microbial biomass and enzyme dynamics alter the decay trajectory of the same leaf litter under field and lab conditions.

AB  - Marine yeasts can occur in a wide range of habitats, including in marine invertebrates, in which they may play important roles; however, investigation of marine yeasts in marine invertebrates is scarce. Therefore, this study aims to explore the diversity of yeasts associated with corals and zoanthids in the Gulf of Thailand. Thirty-three coral and seven zoanthid samples were collected at two sampling sites near Mu and Khram islands. Fifty yeast strains were able to be isolated from 25 of the 40 samples collected. Identification based on sequence analyses of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rRNA gene revealed a higher number of strains in the phylum Basidiomycota (68%) than in the phylum Ascomycota. The ascomycetous yeasts comprised nine known species from four genera (Candida, Meyerozyma, Kodamaea, and Wickerhamomyces), whereas the basidiomycetous yeasts comprised 10 known species from eight genera (Vishniacozyma, Filobasidium, Naganishia, Papiliotrema, Sterigmatomyces, Cystobasidium, Rhodotorula, and Rhodosporidiobolus) and one potentially new species. The species with the highest occurrence was Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) ordination, no marked differences were found in the yeast communities from the two sampling sites. The estimation of the expected richness of species was higher than the actual richness of species observed.

AB  - Agricultural mulch films made from biodegradable polymers (BP) have been used to decrease the burden of plastic waste recovery and recycling. However, their degradations depend largely on environmental conditions and sometimes do not proceed as desired. Yeast strains of Pseudozyma antarctica often isolated from rice husks were found to secrete an esterase to degrade BP films. Poly-butylene succinate-co-adipate (PBSA) films buried in unsterilized rice husks with 60% (w/w) moisture degraded rapidly compared to that buried in field soil. The type strain of P. antarctica JCM 10317 added as cell suspension onto sterilized rice husks with PBSA film grew rapidly forming filamentous growth on the surface of rice husks and films. BP-degrading enzyme secreted by the growing cells was adsorbed on the surface of film and decomposed the film. Addition of rice husk-derived P. antarctica strains also showed BP film degradation activity in sterilized rice husks. In the light of these findings, we suggest that techniques for disposal of used BPs which combine plastics with unutilized residual plant materials piled at the side of agricultural fields be developed.

The present paper formalizes the complete description of a new ascomycete taxon, Arthroderma olidum following successful recent attempts to re-isolate the same fungus from the soil of Badger holes in South West England. Furthermore, using ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we show that the asexual form of A. olidum is conspecific with the recently described Trichophyton eboreum [1] isolated from a human skin specimen in Germany.

AB  - An investigation was made into the occurrence and biodiversity of Geodermatophilaceae on 78 samples of altered stone surfaces from 24 monuments and natural stones in the Mediterranean basin; it was found that the total microbial counts ranged between 0 and 10(7) cfu g(-1) dry weight. Members of the Geodermatophilaceae family were isolated from 22 of the 78 samples examined, with the incidence of Geodermatophilaceae colonies in the cultivable population ranging from 1% to 100%. The highest percentage was found in six samples of markedly deteriorated stone. Sixty-five strains randomly isolated from the plates were clustered in six different groups by amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) using five different restriction enzymes. Twenty-five strains, representing all the ARDRA haplotypes, were characterized further by partial sequencing (350-550 bp) of the 16S rDNA and by analysing 76 morphological, metabolic and physiological properties. The strains were associated with three well-separated clusters of the genera Geodermatophilus, Blastococcus and Modestobacter. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequence and ARDRA analysis, only two strains were found to be related to the two reference strains of Geodermatophilus. All the others could be grouped with Blastococcus aggregatus (19 strains) or the Antarctic species Modestobacter multiseptatus (44 strains), suggesting that it is these two groups, rather than Geodermatophilus, that tend to colonize the stone surfaces, and that Modestobacter-like strains are also found in temperate/Mediterranean climates. From the BOX-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data, it can be seen that the Modestobacter-like strains, belonging to the most represented ARDRA haplotype (haplotype B, 34 strains), are very polymorphic and that, over a stone surface, there is a wide genetic diversity at the microsite level.

AB  - Polar glacier forefields offer an unprecedented framework for studying community assembly processes in regions that are geographically and climatically isolated. Through amplicon sequence variant (ASV) inference, we compared the composition and structure of soil bacterial communities from glacier forefields in Iceland and Antarctica to assess overlap between communities and the impact of established cryptogamic covers on the uniqueness of their taxa. These pioneer microbial communities were found to share only 8% of ASVs and each taxonomic group's contribution to the shared ASV data subset was heterogeneous and independent of their relative abundance. Although the presence of ASVs specific to one glacier forefield and/or different cryptogam cover values confirms the existence of habitat specialist bacteria, our data show that the influence of cryptogams on the edaphic bacterial community structure also varied also depending on the taxonomic group. Hence, the establishment of distinct cryptogamic covers is probably not the only factor driving the uniqueness of bacterial communities at both poles. The structure of bacterial communities colonising deglaciated areas seems also conditioned by lineage-specific limitations in their dispersal capacity and/or their establishment and persistence in these isolated and hostile regions.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Environmental factors influencing the occurrence and community structure of soil yeasts in forests are not well studied. There are few studies dedicated to Southern Hemisphere soil yeasts populations and even fewer focused on temperate forests influenced by volcanic activity. The present work aimed to study the ecology of soil yeast communities from pristine forests influenced by different environmental factors (precipitation, physicochemical properties of soil, tree species, soil region, and season). The survey was performed in 4 northern Patagonian forests: 2 dominated by Nothofagus pumilio and 2 by Nothofagus antarctica. Yeast communities were described with ecological indices and species accumulation curves, and their association with environmental characteristics was assessed using multivariate analysis. Each forest site showed a particular arrangement of species as a result of environmental characteristics, such as dominant plant species, nutrient availability, and climatic characteristics. Cryptococcus podzolicus was most frequently isolated in nutrient-rich soils, Trichosporon porosum dominated cold mountain forests with low nutrient and water availability in soil, and capsulated yeasts such as Cryptococcus phenolicus dominated forest sites with low precipitation. The present work suggests that environmental factors affecting yeast communities may not be the current soil characteristics but the result of complex interactions of factors including natural disturbances like volcanic activity.

AU  - Tsuji, Masaharu
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB  - Microbes growing at subzero temperatures encounter numerous growth constraints. However, fungi that inhabit cold environments can grow and decompose organic compounds under subzero temperatures. Thus, understanding the cold-adaptation strategies of fungi under extreme environments is critical for elucidating polar-region ecosystems. Here, I report that two strains of the Antarctic basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia blollopis exhibited distinct growth characteristics under subzero conditions: SK-4 grew efficiently, whereas TKG1-2 did not. I analysed the metabolite responses elicited by cold stress in these two M. blollopis strains by using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. M. blollopis SK-4, which grew well under subzero temperatures, accumulated high levels of TCA-cycle metabolites, lactic acid, aromatic amino acids and polyamines in response to cold shock. Polyamines are recognized to function in cell-growth and developmental processes, and aromatic amino acids are also known to improve cell growth at low temperatures. By contrast, in TKG1-2, which did not grow efficiently, cold stress strongly induced the metabolites of the TCA cycle, but other metabolites were not highly accumulated in the cell. Thus, these differences in metabolite responses could contribute to the distinct abilities of SK-4 and TKG1-2 cells to grow under subzero temperature conditions.

We developed a versatile consortium-based strategy for the direct conversion of lignocellulose to short-chain fatty acids, which included the funneling of the lignocellulosic carbohydrates to lactate as a central intermediate in engineered food chains. A spatial niche enabled in situ cellulolytic enzyme production by an aerobic fungus next to facultative anaerobic lactic acid bacteria and the product-forming anaerobes. Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Veillonella criceti, or Megasphaera elsdenii were integrated into the lactate platform to produce 196 kilograms of butyric acid per metric ton of beechwood. The lactate platform demonstrates the benefits of mixed cultures, such as their modularity and their ability to convert complex substrates into valuable biochemicals.

AB  - Chitinase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds in chitin, holds significant potential for industrial applications, including biological control, antifungal treatments, and antibiofilm strategies. In this study, chitinase derived from Planomicrobium sp. (PP133202) was immobilized onto a cobalt metal-organic framework (CoMOF), and its properties were extensively analyzed using various biological, chemical, and physical characterization techniques. The microbial source was identified via 16S rRNA sequencing, and enzyme activity was optimized under submerged conditions using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Structural and morphological characterization of the chitinase/Co-MOF complex was conducted through FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD, EDX, and surface area analyses. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were determined to be 42 % and 20 %, respectively. Notably, the immobilized chitinase exhibited a threefold increase in enzymatic activity compared to its free form. Additionally, the chitinase/Co-MOF complex demonstrated enhanced biological control efficacy, effectively inhibiting Tribolium castaneum and multiple pathogenic microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus, and Beauveria bassiana. These findings highlight the potential of chitinase/Co-MOF as a promising agent for antimicrobial and pest control applications.

T2  - MYCOLOGIA
AB  - During the period of early February to early April of 1995, samples for isolation of dictyostelid cellular slime molds were collected from representative examples of all major types of plant communities found on subantarctic Macquarie Island. These included tussock grassland, short grassland, herbfield, fernbrake, mire, and feldmark communities. There are apparently no previous reports of dictyostelids from the south polar region, but Dictyostelium mucoroides was recovered from soil/litter and/ or recovered from soil/litter and/or litter samples collected in tussock grassland, herbfield, and fernbrake communities. Densities were almost invariably low (<50 colony-forming units/g), but one study site yielded 135 colony-forming units/g. The most diverse plant communities on Macquarie are mixed herbfield communities that occur on raised coastal terraces, and the majority of positive samples were collected from these communities. No dictyostelids were recovered from samples collected at higher elevations (generally >200 m) on the main plateau of the island. In general, both frequency of occurrence and density were higher for samples of moist, decomposing litter found around land sometimes still attached to) the bases of such plants as Pleurophyllum hookeri and Stilbocarpa polaris than for samples collected from the soil/litter interface zone.
