  ABSTRACT = {Aspergillus fumigatus is a common opportunistic pathogen in different animals, including birds such as penguins. For the first time, a fungal strain identified as A. fumigatus was isolated from soil in the nests of gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua, on Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands (maritime Antarctica). This isolate (A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829) displayed a series of potentially pathogenic characteristics in vitro. We evaluated its detailed molecular taxonomy and submitted the A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829 Antarctic strain to in vivo pathogenic modelling. The isolate was confirmed to represent A. fumigatus morphological and phylogenetic analysis showed that it was closely related to A. fumigatus sequences reported from animals, immunosuppressed humans, storage grains, plants and soils. The strain displayed the best mycelial growth and conidia production at 37 ºC; however, it was also able to grow and produce conidia at 15º, demonstrating its capability to survive and colonize penguin nest at least in the summer season in maritime Antarctica. In pathogenicity tests, healthy mice did not showed symptoms of infection; however, 50% lethality was observed in immunosuppressed mice that were inoculated with 106 and 107 spores. Lethality increased to 100% when inoculated with 108 spores. Our data highlight the potential pathogenicity of opportunistic A. fumigatus that may be present in the Antarctic, and the risks of both their further transfer within Antarctica and outwards to other continents, risks which may be exacerbated due global climatic changes. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.},

  ABSTRACT = {Harsh and extreme environments, such as Antarctica, offer unique opportunities to explore new microbial taxa and biomolecules. Given the limited knowledge on microbial diversity, this study aimed to compile, analyze and compare a subset of the biobank of Antarctic fungi maintained at the UNESP’s Central of Microbial Resources (CRM-UNESP). A total of 711 isolates (240 yeasts and 471 filamentous fungi) from marine and terrestrial samples collected at King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) were used with the primary objective of investigating their presence in both marine and terrestrial environments. Among the yeasts, 13 genera were found, predominantly belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. Among the filamentous fungi, 34 genera were represented, predominantly from the phylum Ascomycota. The most abundant genera in the marine samples were Metschnikowia, Mrakia, and Pseudogymnoascus, while in the terrestrial samples, they were Pseudogymnoascus, Leucosporidium, and Mortierella. Most of the genera and species of the CRM-UNESP biobank of Antarctic fungi are being reported as an important target for biotechnological applications. This study showed the relevance of the CRM-UNESP biobank, highlighting the importance of applying standard methods for the preservation of the biological material and associated data (BMaD), as recommended in national and international standards. © 2023, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

  ABSTRACT = {Ochrathinols A and B ((±)-1 and (±)-2), two undescribed sulfur-containing racemates, and ochracids A and B (3 and 4), two unprecedented pyrrolizidine alkaloids, were isolated from an Antarctic soil-derived fungus Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis SCSIO 05702. Their structures including absolute configurations were determined through extensive spectroscopic analysis, chiral-phase HPLC analysis, quantum ECD calculations, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. Ochrathinols A and B are unprecedented sulfur natural products featuring a novel 3-methylhexahydro-2H-cyclopenta [b]thiophene core.

  ABSTRACT = {The fungus Psychrophilomyces antarcticus M.M. Wang & Xing Z. Liu, previously known only from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Antarctica, was isolated in the Arctic from sediments on the littoral of the Kara Sea (Shokalsky Island) and represented by strains VKM F-5025/CBS 151455 and VKM F-5026/CBS 151456. The macro- and micro-morphology of the isolate was studied together with partial sequences of the DNA regions ITS, LSU, TEF1, and β-TUB, as well as the optimal values for temperature, pH and salinity. Slight differences between our two isolates and previously known strains of P. antarcticus were found in morphology (colony color and shape, size of phialides and spores) and physiological traits (optimal growth temperature, range of acceptable temperature and pH values for growth, colony odor, and degree of mucosity under extreme conditions). However, the high similarity in the sequenced conservative DNA sequences from 100 to 97% indicates that these slight morphological and physiological variations of the studied strains of P. antarcticus are intraspecific variation. Our study demonstrates that P. antarcticus is a cold-adapted poly-extreme tolerant species that can occur and function in extremely cold areas, such as high alpine, Antarctic, and Arctic regions. © 2024 The Authors},

  ABSTRACT = {In this study, biocatalysts in the form of mycelium-bound lipases of psychrotrophic and mesophilic fungi were screened for their ability to synthesize fatty acid methyl (FAME) and ethyl esters (FAEE). It has been shown that the hydrolytic activity of biocatalysts is not accompanied by their biodiesel synthetic activity. Preliminary studies showed for the first time, that the FTIR technique can be used to predict synthetic activity. The highest correlation between the intensity of the bands and synthetic activity, negative and positive, respectively, was observed for two neighboring bands at 1745 cm−1 (R = −0.73) and 1699 cm−1 (R = 0.68). The psychrotrophic strain Penicillium sp. 59, isolated from the soil of the Arctic tundra (Spitsbergen), has been shown for the first time as an efficient whole-cell biocatalyst for fatty acid ethyl ester synthesis and is stable in organic solvents. Mathematical optimization of biosynthesis was also performed using RSM. A molar canola oil conversion value of 83.3% into FAEE was obtained at 24.2 °C in n-hexane using 7.6% of used canola oil and 5.3% of the fungal biocatalyst within 6 h. Dry mycelium of Penicillium sp. 59 is a promising new biocatalyst for large-scale biosynthesis of biodiesel, given its low-cost production, high activity at room temperature, no need to mix reactions, and reusability in a minimum of six cycles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  ABSTRACT = {Deception Island is well-known for harboring highly diverse microbial communities due to its unique volcanic environment in Antarctica. Most studies focused on bacteria, and relatively little was known about the fungal species on this island. The present study was aimed to determine the antimicrobial production and nutrient utilization profiles of a soil fungus from Deception Island, designated as Im33. Our findings showed that the strain had maximum mycelial growth and sporulation on malt-extract agar (MEA) medium, but it demonstrated the strongest antimicrobial activity in yeast extract-malt extract broth (YMB) medium. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 regions showed that it is a species belonging to the genus Talaromyces. It was resistant to cycloheximide concentrations up to 1,000 mg/L and exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative test pathogens, as well as being able to utilize a variety of carbon sources. This is the first report of a Talaromyces species from Deception Island. The capability of the strain to produce broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds and various enzymes indicated that Antarctic fungi, like their bacterial counterparts, have adopted various adaptation strategies to compete and survive in the extreme environment. © 2023 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

  ABSTRACT = {Plant pathogens cause great economic losses in agriculture. To reduce damage, chemical pesticides have been frequently used, but these compounds in addition to causing risks to the environment and health, its continuous use has given rise to resistant phytopathogens, threatening the efficiency of control methods. One alternative for such a problem is the use of natural products with high antifungal activity and low toxicity. Here, we present the production, isolation, and identification of cyclopaldic acid, a bioactive compound produced by Penicillium sp. CRM 1540, a fungal strain isolated from Antarctic marine sediment. The crude extract was fractionated by reversed-phase chromatography and yielded 40 fractions, from which fraction F17 was selected. We used 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis in DMSO-d6 and CDCl3, together with mass spectrometry, to identify the compound as cyclopaldic acid C11H10O6 (238 Da). The pure compound was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against phytopathogenic fungi of global agricultural importance, namely: Macrophomina phaseolina, Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The antifungal assay revealed the potential of cyclopaldic acid, produced by Penicillium sp. CRM 1540, as a leading molecule against M. phaseolina and R. solani, with more than 90% of growth inhibition after 96h of contact with the fungal cells using 100 µg mL−1, and more than 70% using 50 µg mL−1. © 2023, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

  ABSTRACT = {Aims: Citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri) is a disease of economic importance. Control of this disease includes the use of metallic copper, which is harmful to the environment and human health. Previous studies showed that the crude extract from the fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. LAMAI 2784 isolated from Antarctic soil had in vitro antibacterial action against X. citri. The aim of the present study was to expand the applications of this extract. Methods and results: In greenhouse assays, the crude extract was able to reduce bacterial infection on citrus leaves from 1.55 lesions/cm2 (untreated plants) to 0.04 lesions/cm2. Bisdechlorogeodin was identified as the main compound of the bioactive fraction produced by Pseudogymnoascus sp. LAMAI 2784, which inhibited bacterial growth in vitro (IC90 ≈ 156 μg ml−1) and permeated 80% of X. citri cells, indicating that the membrane is the primary target. Conclusion: The present results showed that the bioactive fraction of the extract is mainly composed of the compound bisdechlorogeodin, which is likely responsible for the biological activity against X. citri, and the main mechanism of action is the targeting of the cell membrane. This study indicates that bisdechlorogeodin has valuable potential for the control of X. citri. © The Author(s) 2024.

  ABSTRACT = {The quantity of industrially polluted waters is increasing everywhere, of which a significant part is occupied by a number of mono- and poly-aromatic compounds. Toxins enter the soil, sewage, and clean water by mixing with or seeping into them from industrial wastewater. By using 18S RNA and ITS sequences, the Penicillium commune AL5 strain that was isolated from Antarctic soil was identified. This study is dedicated to exploring its capacity to metabolize hazardous aromatic compounds. The strain showed very good potential in the degradation of hydroxylated monophenols and possessed exceptional abilities in terms of resorcinol degradation. The strain’s ability to metabolize 0.3 g/L of p-cresol at 10 °C is notable. The strain is also capable of metabolizing LMW PAHs (naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene) and eliminating all three tested compounds under 23 °C, respectively, 77.5%, 93.8%, and 75.1%. At 10 °C, the process slowed down, but the degradation of naphthalene continued to be over 50%. The quantity of PAH and a few significant intermediary metabolites were determined using GC–MS analysis. Sequencing of the enzymes phenol hydroxylase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase revealed a close association with the genes and proteins in some fungal strains that can degrade the aromatic compounds examined thus far. © 2023 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Societal Impact Statement: Climate change is predicted to increase drought and soil salinity in Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), posing a significant threat to global food security. Genetic modification of crops to counteract this threat is expensive and has not met with universal support, and alternatives are hence needed to enhance crop production in MTEs. Here, fungal endophytes from the Atacama Desert, High Andes and Antarctica inoculated onto three crops were found to alleviate the negative effects of drought and salinity on plant performance. The study concludes that extremophile endophytes might be used to enhance crop performance as the climate of MTEs changes over future decades. Summary: Climate change will curtail the ability to provide sufficient food for our rapidly expanding population. Improvements to crop production in changing environments, particularly Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), which are increasingly subjected to drought and salinisation, are hence urgently needed. Here, we explored the possibility that fungal endophytes from extreme environments can be used to enhance crop yield, survival and tolerance to environmental stresses. Plants of lettuce, tomato and bell pepper were inoculated with up to six species of endophytic fungi isolated from the Atacama Desert, the High Andes and Antarctica. They were then exposed in the field for up to 120 days in each of three summers to current climatic conditions or to a future climate scenario simulating increased drought and soil salinisation. Compared with uninoculated plants, the yield and survival of inoculated crops were increased by up to two-fold under the future climate scenario. These effects were in part attributable to the improved water balance of inoculated crops exposed to drought and salinisation. The inocula also increased the concentrations of total phenols and proline in leaves and decreased lipid peroxidation when plants were subjected to increased aridity and salinity. A mixed inoculum of six endophytes from the extreme environments conferred the most beneficial effects on crop performance, with a commercially available inoculum having fewer positive effects on crops. We conclude that the inoculation of crops with endophytes from extreme environments may be a viable solution to sustaining crop production in MTEs exposed to rapid climate change. © 2023 The Authors.

  ABSTRACT = {A new fungal species, Penicillium psychrofluorescens sp. nov. is described as a member of section Torulomyces. The new species is sister to P. catalonicum, and was isolated from soil collected from Robinson Ridge, East Antarctica, following enrichment cultivation under oligotrophic conditions supplemented with excess hydrogen gas. Penicillium psychrofluorescens is named for its intense autofluorescence derived from a combination of compounds that may include NADPH, porphyrins, and secondary metabolites, such as polyketides. Comparative genomics with both Antarctic and mesophilic Penicillium spp. shows that Penicillium psychrofluorescens has a wide repertoire of glycoside hydrolases, but almost no polysaccharide lyases, has comparably large effector proteins, lacks the machinery to use nitrate as an N-source, but has the genes for the assimilation of phosphorus from phosphonates via oxidative pathway. The strain was found to have 30 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), the majority of which were unrelated to known compound BGCs. Given the remarkable diversity of natural products already characterised from Penicillium spp. and the presence of >30 BGCs with low similarity to known genes, there is biotechnological potential within this novel species that is yet to be explored. © 2024 The Author(s).

  ABSTRACT = {Microbial adaptations to extreme environments can lead to biotechnological applications. This study aimed to evaluate the resistance of Antarctic Cladosporium to adverse conditions (temperature, salinity, UV radiation, and nutrients) and refine their taxonomy. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis using ITS-act markers resulted in a more accurate taxonomic identification, revealing the presence of five different species, belonging to the complexes C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum. The growth at different temperatures indicates that the soil isolates LAMAI 564 and 1800 (phylogenetically closely related) and LAMAI 2541 are psychrophilic, while the other isolates are psychrotolerant. The fungi isolated from the saline samples LAMAI 595, 616, and 1369 showed better growth results at higher salinity (15%). The fungi most resistant to UV radiation were isolated from terrestrial and marine samples (LAMAI 595, 616, 1800, and 564). LAMAI 595 and 616 (phylogenetically closely related and isolated from the same kind of sample) showed the capacity of nutritional versatility, growing well in both rich and poor-nutrient media. The fungus LAMAI 595 was the most promising for biotechnological application, exceeding the other isolates in the harsh conditions studied. The resistance of the Antarctic Cladosporium to adverse conditions opens new perspectives in the field of applied microbiology of extremophiles. © 2024, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Lichens are complex symbiotic associations between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. Due to their great adaptability to the environment, they have managed to colonize many terrestrial habitats, presenting a worldwide distribution from the poles to the tropical regions and from the plains to the highest mountains. In the flora of the Antarctic region, lichens stand out due to their variety and development and are a potential source of new bioactive compounds. Methods: A phytochemical study of the Antarctic lichen Usnea aurantiaco-atra (Jacq) Bory was conducted with the intention of determining the most important metabolites. In addition, the cytotoxic and antioxidant activities of its extracts were determined. Results: Cytotoxicity studies revealed that the hexane extract contains usnic acid as a majority metabolite, in addition to linoleic acid, ergosterols and terpenes, and demonstrates cytotoxic activity against an A375 melanoma cell line. On the other hand, the presence of total phenols in the extracts did not influence their antioxidant activity. Conclusions: U. aurantiaco-atra contains mainly usnic acid, although there are terpenes and ergosta compounds that could be responsible for its cytotoxic activity. The presence of phenols did not confer antioxidant properties. © 2023 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctica harbors a microbial diversity still poorly explored and of inestimable biotechnological value. Cold-adapted microorganisms can produce a diverse range of metabolites stable at low temperatures, making these compounds industrially interesting for biotechnological use. The present work investigated the biotechnological potential for antimicrobial and antitumor activity of filamentous fungi and bacteria isolated from marine sediment samples collected at Deception Island, Antarctica. A total of 89 microbial isolates were recovered from marine sediments and submitted to an initial screening for l-glutaminase with antitumoral activity and for antimicrobial metabolites. The isolates Pseudogymnoascus sp. FDG01, Pseudogymnoascus sp. FDG02, and Penicillium sp. FAD33 showed potential antiproliferative action against human pancreatic carcinoma cells while showing no toxic effect on non-tumor cells. The microbial extracts from unidentified three bacteria and four filamentous fungi showed antibacterial activity against at least one tested pathogenic bacterial strain. The isolate FDG01 inhibited four bacterial species, while the isolate FDG01 was active against Micrococcus luteus in the minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.015625 μg mL −1. The results pave the way for further optimization of enzyme production and characterization of enzymes and metabolites found and reaffirm Antarctic marine environments as a wealthy source of compounds potentially applicable in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

  ABSTRACT = {The use of yeasts has been explored as an efficient alternative to fungicide application in the treatment and prevention of post-harvest fruit deterioration. Here, we evaluated the biocontrol abilities of the Antarctic yeast strain Debaryomyces hansenii UFT8244 against the post-harvest phytopathogenic fungi Botrytis cinerea and Rhizopus stolonifer for the protection and preservation of strawberry fruit. The strongest inhibition of germination of B. cinerea (57%) was observed at 0 °C, followed by 40% at 25 °C. In addition, germ tubes and hyphae of B. cinerea were strongly surrounded and colonized by D. hansenii. Production of the enzymes β-1,3-glucanase, chitinase and protease by D. hansenii was detected in the presence of phytopathogenic fungus cell walls. The activity of β-1,3-glucanase was highest on day 12 of incubation and remained high until day 15. Chitinase and protease activities reached their highest levels on the day 15 of incubation. D. hansenii additionally demonstrated the ability to resist oxidative stress. Our data demonstrated that the main biocontrol mechanisms displayed by D. hansenii were the control of phytopathogenic fungal spore germination, production of antifungal enzymes and resistance to oxidative stress. We conclude that isolate D. hansenii UFT8422 should be further investigated for use at commercial scales at low temperatures. © 2024, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Lichenized fungi are the dominant elements of the Antarctic terrestrial vegetation. Recently, biodiversity studies of lichenized fungi in Antarctica have increased and the studies have started to become more phylogeny-based. Previous studies on the genera Amandinea, Buellia and Tetramelas in Antarctica and also Southern Hemisphere were mostly based on their anatomical-morphological and chemical properties. The present study is aimed at contributing to these three buellioid genera in Antarctica especially using molecular characters. As a result of studying Antarctic collections morphologically and phylogenetically based on nrITS and/or mtSSU gene data, we identified Amandinea babingtonii (Hook. f. & Taylor) Søchting & Øvstedal, Amandinea coniops (Wahlenb.)

  ABSTRACT = {Cold-adapted microorganisms can produce enzymes with activity at low and mild temperatures, which can be applied to environmental biotechnology. This study aimed to characterize 20 Antarctic fungi to identify their genus (ITS rDNA marker) and growth temperatures and evaluate their ability to decolorize and detoxify the textile dye indigo carmine (IC). An individual screening was performed to assess the decolorization and detoxification of IC by the isolates, as well as in consortia with other fungi. The isolates were affiliated with seven ascomycete genera: Aspergillus (n = 4), Cosmospora (n = 2), Leuconeurospora (n = 2), Penicillium (n = 3), Pseudogymnoascus (n = 6), Thelebolus (n = 2), and Trichoderma (n = 1). The two isolates from the genus Leuconeurospora were characterized as psychrophilic, while the others were psychrotolerant. The Penicillium isolates were able to decolorize between 60 and 82% of IC. The isolates identified as Pseudogymnoascus showed the best detoxification capacity, with results varying from 49 to 74%. The consortium using only Antarctic ascomycetes (C1) showed 45% of decolorization, while the consortia with the addition of basidiomycetes (C1 + Peniophora and C1 + Pholiota) showed 40% and 50%, respectively. The consortia C1 with the addition of the basidiomycetes presented a lower toxicity after the treatments. In addition, a higher fungal biomass was produced in the presence of dye when compared with the experiment without the dye, which can be indicative of dye metabolization. The results highlight the potential of marine-derived Antarctic fungi in the process of textile dye degradation. The findings encourage further studies to elucidate the degradation and detoxification pathways of the dye IC by these fungal isolates. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.},

  ABSTRACT = {The fungal strain, Penicillium griseofulvum P29, isolated from a soil sample taken from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, was found to be a good producer of sialidase (P29). The present study was focused on the purification and structural characterization of the enzyme. P29 enzyme was purified using a Q-Sepharose column and fast performance liquid chromatography separation on a Mono Q column. The determined molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 40 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 39924.40 Da by matrix desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis correlated well with the calculated mass (39903.75 kDa) from the amino acid sequence of the enzyme. P29 sialidase shows a temperature optimum of 37 °C and low-temperature stability, confirming its cold-active nature. The enzyme is more active towards α(2 → 3) sialyl linkages than those containing α(2 → 6) linkages. Based on the determined amino acid sequence and 3D structural modeling, a 3D model of P29 sialidase was presented, and the properties of the enzyme were explained. The conformational stability of the enzyme was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the new enzyme was found to be conformationally stable in the neutral pH range of pH 6 to pH 9. In addition, the enzyme was more stable in an alkaline environment than in an acidic environment. The purified cold-active enzyme is the only sialidase produced and characterized from Antarctic fungi to date. © 2023 The Authors},

  ABSTRACT = {Unique biotopes can be a source of new plant growth promotion (PGP) bacteria with rare properties. The Antarctic habitat is an attractive location for research, as it is characterized by many stress factors, and the local microbiota is under permanent selective pressure. We believe that the rhizosphere bacteria of this habitat may have important PGP properties that can be used in agriculture. A variety of research methods were used in this work: the molecular genetic technique to establish the gene sequence, chemical to test the ability to produce nitrite, ammonia, and indole acetic acid, microbiological to investigate the cultured properties of the strain, as well as antagonistic and PGP activities. We found that the strain belongs to the genus Amycolatopsis. It showed antagonistic activity against phytopathogenic bacteria (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris IMB8003 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 31324) and fungi (Alternaria alternata DSM 1102, Fusarium oxysporum ІМВ 54201, Aspergillus niger ІМВ 16706), and also demonstrated some PGP properties (solubilization of phosphorus and zinc and production of nitrite and ammonia). Inoculation of wheat seeds with spores of this strain promoted germination and growth of seedlings. The strain has demonstrated properties that make it a promising basis for developing biofertilizers that can be used in agriculture. © 2023, State Institution National Antarctic Scientific Center of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.

  ABSTRACT = {The surface temperatures of Antarctic soils and bryophyte colonies can fluctuate from close to freezing point to approximately 20 °C under clear skies around solar noon during midsummer. However, whether diurnally fluctuating temperatures influence the growth and metabolic activities of fungi inhabiting these substrates remains unknown. Here, 10 isolates of Pseudogymnoascus roseus, an ascomycete that is widespread in Antarctica, were exposed in vitro to temperatures fluctuating daily from 2 °C to 15–24 °C. Relative to controls incubated at the constant mean temperature of each treatment, temperatures fluctuating from 2 °C to ≥18 °C inhibited the growth of all isolates by 10–51% at 24 h and 48 h, and by up to 79% for individual isolates. Over a period of 21 days, all fluctuating temperature treatments reduced mean growth rates by between 3% and 48%, but had few effects on specific β-glucosidase activity, a proxy measure for metabolic activity. It is concluded that temperatures fluctuating diurnally to ≥18 °C during summer in mesic Antarctic soils and bryophyte colonies, exacerbated by the occurrence of climate-change associated heatwaves, are likely to inhibit the growth of P. roseus and perhaps also other ecologically important fungi. © 2023 The Author},

  ABSTRACT = {In understanding stress response mechanisms in fungi, cold stress has received less attention than heat stress. However, cold stress has shown its importance in various research fields. The following study examined the cold stress response of six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolated from various biogeographical regions through a proteomic approach. In total, 2541 proteins were identified with high confidence. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed diversity in the cold stress response pathways for all six Pseudogymnoascus spp. isolates, with metabolic and translation-related processes being prominent in most isolates. 25.6% of the proteins with an increase in relative abundance were increased by more than 3.0-fold. There was no link between the geographical origin of the isolates and the cold stress response of Pseudogymnoascus spp. However, one Antarctic isolate, sp3, showed a distinctive cold stress response profile involving increased flavin/riboflavin biosynthesis and methane metabolism. This Antarctic isolate (sp3) was also the only one that showed decreased phospholipid metabolism in cold stress conditions. This work will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cold stress response and adaptation in psychrotolerant soil microfungi, with specific attention to the fungal genus Pseudogymnoascus. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Scarce research into the secondary metabolites of the fungi Pseudogymnoascus spp. has shown a hidden biosynthetic potential for biologically active compounds. This work investigated the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by two Pseudogymnoascus fungal strains, VKM F-4518 and VKM F-4519, isolated from the surface soil layer of the Kolyma Lowland, Russia, in the Arctic. In these strains, 16-membered trilactone macrolides, (+)-macrosphelides A and B, were identified using 1D and 2D NMR, UHRMS, and optical rotation data. In the fungi of this genus, these metabolites were found for the first time. The studied strains are highly active producers of macrosphelide A, which is being considered as a promising agent for the cure of cancer. Using the antiSMASH secondary metabolite analysis tool, we found that the genome of strain VKM F-4518 contained 32 of the biosynthetic clusters of the secondary metabolite genes (BGC) and that of VKM F-4519 had 17 BGCs. Based on the comparison of the cluster of macrotriolide genes from the fungus Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa, we found the complete supposed cluster BGCs of macrosphelides in the genomes of two Pseudogymnoascus strains using the BLAST+ program. © 2023 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Metabolites isolated from Penicillium palitans, obtained from deep sea sediments in the maritime Antarctica, were investigated for phytotoxic and antifungal activities. The fungus was submitted to solid state fermentation, and its crude extract was produced. Chromatographic separations of the P. palitans methylene chloride crude extract led to the isolation of two analogous compounds: (−)-penienone (1) and (−)-palitantin (2). The phytotoxic activity of these compounds was assessed against seeds of Lactuca sativa and Agrostis stolonifera. Both compounds demonstrated activity exclusively in the monocotyledonous model, A. stolonifera. At a concentration of 1 mg mL−1, (−)-penienone caused 100 % inhibition of seed germination, while (−)-palitantin had only moderate activity on germination and growth of seedlings at this concentration after 7 days of treatment. Against Lemna paucicostata, at 57 μM, (−)-penienone inhibited growth by 50 % (IC50). (−)-Palitantin was much less active. When evaluated for their antifungal activity against Colletotrichum fragariae, only (−)-penienone had an IC50 value of 0.3 μM. The strain P. palitans was shown to be a promising source of phytotoxic and antifungal compounds, suggesting that extremophilic fungi, such as wild Penicillium strains from Antarctica, have the potential to yield novel prototype molecules for new pesticide development. © 2024 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.},

  ABSTRACT = {Climatic change is pointed as one of the major challenges for global food security. Based on current models of climate change, reduction in precipitations and in turn, increase in the soil salinity will be a sharp constraint for crops productivity worldwide. In this context, root fungi appear as a new strategy to improve plant ecophysiological performance and crop yield under abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the two fungal endophytes Penicillium brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum isolated from Antarctic plants on nutrients and Na+ contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency, yield and survival in tomato and lettuce, facing salinity stress conditions. Inoculation of plant roots with fungal endophytes resulted in greater fresh and dry biomass production, and an enhanced survival rate under salt conditions. Inoculation of plants with the fungal endophytes was related with a higher up/down-regulation of ion homeostasis by enhanced expression of the NHX1 gene. The two endophytes diminished the effects of salt stress in tomato and lettuce, provoked a higher efficiency in photosynthetic energy production and an improved sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles is suggested by the upregulating of the expression of vacuolar NHX1 Na+/H+ antiporters. Promoting plant-beneficial interactions with root symbionts appears to be an environmentally friendly strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change variables on crop production. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Based on the maximum-likelihood analyses, K. obscura was closely related to Knufia hypolithi (99 % bootstrap support), while K. victoriae clustered in the clade of Knufia cryptophialidica and Knufia perfecta (93 % bootstrap support). Knufia victoriae, recorded in Antarctic soil samples, had a psychrophilic behaviour, with optimal growth between 10 and 15 °C and no growth recorded at 20 °C. Knufia obscura, from a gasoline car tank and algae, displayed optimal growth between 20 and 25 °C and was more tolerant to salinity than K. victoriae. © 2022 The Authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fungal biotransformation is an attractive synthetic strategy to produce highly specific compounds with chemical functionality in regions of the carbon skeleton that are not easily activated by conventional organic chemistry methods. In this work, Cladosporium antarcticum isolated from sediments of Glacier Collins in Antarctica was used to obtain novel drimane sesquiterpenoids alcohols with activity against Candida yeast from drimendiol and epidrimendiol. These compounds were produced by the high-yield reduction of polygodial and isotadeonal with NaBH4 in methanol. Cladosporium antarcticum produced two major products from drimendiol, identified as 9α-hydroxydrimendiol (1, 41.4 mg, 19.4% yield) and 3β-hydroxydrimendiol (2, 74.8 mg, 35% yield), whereas the biotransformation of epidrimendiol yielded only one product, 9β-hydroxyepidrimendiol (3, 86.6 mg, 41.6% yield). The products were purified by column chromatography and their structure elucidated by NMR and MS. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–3 was analyzed against Candida albicans, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, showing that compound 2 has a MIC lower than 15 µg/mL against the three-pathogenic yeast. In silico studies suggest that a possible mechanism of action for the novel compounds is the inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, affecting the ergosterol synthesis. © 2022 by the authors.},

  ABSTRACT = {The Antarctic continent is one of the most inhospitable places on earth, where living creatures, mostly represented by microorganisms, have specific physiological characteristics that allow them to adapt to the extreme environmental conditions. These physiological adaptations can result in the production of unique secondary metabolites with potential biotechnological applications. The current study presents a genetic and antibacterial characterization of four Antarctic fungi isolated from soil samples collected in Pedro Vicente Maldonado Scientific Station, at Fort William Point, Greenwich Island, Antarctica. Based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the fungi were identified as Antarctomyces sp., Thelebolus sp., Penicillium sp., and Cryptococcus gilvescens. The antibacterial activity was assessed against four clinical bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, by a modified bacterial growth inhibition assay on agar plates. Results showed that C. gilvescens and Penicillium sp. have potential antibiotic activity against all bacterial strains. Interestingly, Thelebolus sp. showed potential antibiotic activity only against E. coli. In contrast, Antarctomyces sp. did not show antibiotic activity against any of the bacteria tested under our experimental conditions. This study highlights the importance of conservation of Antarctica as a source of metabolites with important biomedical applications. © 2022, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Cold-active catalase (CAT) elicits great interest because of its vast prospective at the medical, commercial, and biotechnological levels. The study paper reports the production of cold-active CAT by the strain Penicillium griseofulvum P29 isolated from Antarctic soil. Improved enzyme production was achieved by optimization of medium and culture conditions. Maximum CAT was demonstrated under low glucose content (2%), 10% inoculum size, temperature 20°C, and dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) 40%. An effective laboratory technology based on changing the oxidative stress level through an increase of DO in the bioreactor was developed. The used strategy resulted in a 1.7- and 1.4-fold enhanced total enzyme activity and maximum enzyme productivity. The enzyme was purified and characterized. P. griseofulvum P29 CAT was most active at approximately 20°C and pH 6.0. Its thermostability was in the range between 5°C and 40°C. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

  ABSTRACT = {During the evolution organisms are subjected to the continuous impact of environmental factors. In recent years an increasing number of studies have focused on the physicochemical limits of life on Earth such as temperature, pressure, drought, salt content, pH, heavy metals, etc. Extreme environmental conditions disrupt the most important interactions that support the function and structure of biomolecules. For this reason, organisms inhabiting extreme habitats have recently become of particularly great interest. Although filamentous fungi are an important part of the polar ecosystem, information about their distribution and diversity, as well as their adaptation mechanisms, is insufficient. In the present study, the fungal strain Penicillium griseofulvum isolated from an Antarctic soil sample was used as a study model. The fungal cellular response against short term exposure to low temperature was observed. Our results clearly showed that short-term low temperature exposure caused oxidative stress in fungal cells and resulted in enhanced level of oxidative damaged proteins, accumulation of reserve carbohydrates and increased activity of the antioxidant enzyme defence. Ultrastructural changes in cell morphology were analysed. Different pattern of cell pathology provoked by the application of two stress temperatures was detected. Overall, this study aimed to observe the survival strategy of filamentous fungi in extremely cold habitats, and to acquire new knowledge about the relationship between low temperature and oxidative stress.

  ABSTRACT = {We report a previously undescribed member of the Helotiales that is superabundant in soils at two maritime Antarctic islands under Antarctic Hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.). High throughput sequencing showed that up to 92% of DNA reads, and 68% of RNA reads, in soils from the islands were accounted for by the fungus. Sequencing of the large subunit region of ribosomal (r)DNA places the fungus close to the Pezizellaceae, Porodiplodiaceae, and Sclerotiniaceae, with analyses of internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA indicating that it has affinities to previously unnamed soil and root fungi from alpine, cool temperate and Low Arctic regions. The fungus was found to be most frequent in soils containing C aged to 1,000–1,200 years before present. The relative abundances of its DNA and RNA reads were positively associated with soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations and δ13C values, with the relative abundance of its DNA being negatively associated with soil pH value. An isolate of the fungus produces flask-shaped phialides with a pronounced venter bearing masses of conidia measuring 4.5–6(7) × 1.8–2.5 μm, suggestive of anamorphic Chalara. Enzymatic studies indicate that the isolate strongly synthesizes the extracellular enzyme acid phosphatase, and also exhibits alkaline phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activities. Ecophysiological measurements indicate optimal hyphal growth of the isolate at a pH of 4.2–4.5 and a water potential of −0.66 MPa. The isolate is a psychrotroph, exhibiting measureable hyphal growth at −2°C, optimal hyphal extension rate at 15°C and negligible growth at 25°C. It is proposed that the rising temperatures that are predicted to occur in maritime Antarctica later this century will increase the growth rate of the fungus, with the potential loss of ancient C from soils. Analyses using the GlobalFungi Database indicate that the fungus is present in cold, acidic soils on all continents. We advocate further studies to identify whether it is superabundant in soils under D. antarctica elsewhere in maritime Antarctica, and for further isolates to be obtained so that the species can be formally described. © Copyright © 2020 Newsham, Cox, Sands, Garnett, Magan, Horrocks, Dungait and Robinson.},

  ABSTRACT = {Biotechnologies based on microbial species capable of destroying harmful pollutants are a successful way to solve some of the most important problems associated with a clean environment. The subject of investigation is the Antarctic fungal strain Aspergillus glaucus AL1. The culturing of the examined strain was performed with 70 mg of wet mycelium being inoculated in a Czapek Dox liquid medium containing naphthalene, anthracene, or phenanthrene (0.3 g/L) as the sole carbon source. Progressively decreasing naphthalene and anthracene concentrations were monitored in the culture medium until the 15th day of the cultivation of A. glaucus AL1. The degradation was determined through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Both decreased by 66% and 44%, respec-tively, for this period. The GC-MS analyses were applied to identify salicylic acid, catechol, and ketoadipic acid as intermediates in the naphthalene degradation. The intermediates identified in anthracene catabolism are 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid, o-phthalic acid, and protocatechuic acid. The enzyme activities for phenol 2-monooxygenase (1.14.13.7) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (1.13.11.1) were established. A gene encoding an enzyme with catechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity was identified and sequenced (GeneBank Ac. No KM360483). The recent study provides original data on the potential of an ascomycete’s fungal strain A. glaucus strain AL 1 to degrade naphthalene and anthracene. © 2022 by the authors.

  ABSTRACT = {While diversity studies and screening for enzyme activities are important elements of understanding fungal roles in the soil ecosystem, extracting and purifying the target enzyme from the fungal cellular system is also required to characterize the enzyme. This is, in particular, necessary before developing the enzyme for industrial-scale production. In the present study, partially purified α-amylase was obtained from strains of Pseudogymnoascus sp. obtained from Antarctic and Arctic locations. Partially purified α-amylases from these polar fungi exhibited very similar characteristics, including being active at 15 °C, although having a small difference in optimum pH. Both fungal taxa are good candidates for the potential application of cold-active enzymes in biotechnological industries, and further purification and characterization steps are now required. The α-amylases from polar fungi are attractive in terms of industrial development because they are active at lower temperatures and acidic pH, thus potentially creating energy and cost savings. Furthermore, they prevent the production of maltulose, which is an undesirable by-product often formed under alkaline conditions. Psychrophilic amylases from the polar Pseudogymnoascus sp. investigated in the present study could provide a valuable future contribution to biotechnological applications. © 2022 by the authors.},

The planar structure of these peptides was determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry combined with extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configuration of the amino acids was determined by Marfey’s method, with HPLC analysis of FDVA (Nα-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorphenyl)-l-valinamide) derivatives making use of a PFP column. Remarkably, cadophorin 2 possesses both the uncommon d-Ile and d-allo-Ile in its structure. The peptides have metal binding properties as shown by LCMS with post column addition of metal salt solutions. These results were supported by DFT calculations.

However, considering that it plays a key role in the rapidly warming global climate system and its contribution to the continuing sea-level rise, its importance today is increasing day by day and it can be seen that it is of vital importance for humanity. There is increasing interest in the distribution of terrestrial organisms in Antarctica because of the potential use of biodiversity as a predictor or indicator of climate change. Lichenized fungi cover large areas of Antarctica that are not covered by ice and form precursor organisms that thrive in harsh environments. They are the largest contributors to biomass and diversity. The characteristic features of these organisms can be counted as developing certain protective mechanisms, adapting to temperature and radiation, and surviving even when the amount of water in their body is minimized. On the other hand, lichenized fungi are the most dominant components of Antarctic terrestrial vegetation, and their adaptation to extreme conditions; growth forms, reproduction, adaptation to environmental conditions can also be explained through mechanisms. Because of the lichens, dominant organisms of Antarctica, studying lichen biodiversity is very important. Although around 500 species of lichens were reported from Antarctica, the lichen biodiversity of the continent is far from being fully known; as in the last 5 years of our studies on Antarctic lichens, we and other scientists reported a significant number of undescribed or unreported species. So the lichen biodiversity of Antarctica is not fully known as there are still many undescribed or unreported species on the continent. In this paper, we deal with three lichenized fungal species: Arthonia glebosa Tuck., Lecanora atromarginata (H. Magn.) Hertel & Rambold and Lecidea tessellata Flörke which are common in James Ross Island, using nrITS, mtSSU, and RPB1 sequences. The lichen samples are studied by morphological and anatomical characters. In addition, to determine the phylogenetic positions of the species, we provide nrITS and mtSSU of these 3 species from Antarctica and additionally RPB1 sequences of Lecidea tessellata. © 2021, State Institution National Antarctic Scientific Center of the Ministry of Education.

  ABSTRACT = {Aims: The control of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri), causal agent of citrus canker, relies heavily on integrated agricultural practices involving the use of copper-based chemicals. Considering the need for alternatives to control this disease and the potential of fungi from extreme environments as producers of bioactive metabolites, we isolated and identified a bioactive compound from Penicillium sp. CRM 1540 isolated from Antarctica marine sediment. Methods and Results: The potential of compound as an antibacterial agent against X. citri was assessed through in vitro and greenhouse experiments. Molecular taxonomy indicates that this fungus is a possible new species of Penicillium. Results revealed 90% bacterial inhibition in vitro at 25 µg ml–1 and a decrease in 75.37% of citrus canker symptoms emergency in vivo in treated leaves of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck considering the number of lesions per cm2 (p < 0.05) in comparison with the control. The structure of the active agent was identified as penicillic acid based on a detailed spectroscopic analysis. Conclusion: Penicillic acid can be an alternative against citrus canker. Significance and Impact of Study: Research into extremophile micro-organisms can identify molecules with biotechnological potential and alternatives to current agricultural practices. © 2021 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

  ABSTRACT = {Evidence from recent Mars landers identified the presence of perchlorates salts at 1 wt % in regolith and their widespread distribution on the Martian surface that has been hypothesized as a critical chemical hazard for putative life forms. However, the hypersaline environment may also potentially preserve life and its biomolecules over geological timescales. The high concentration of natural perchlorates is scarcely reported on Earth. The presence of perchlorates in soil and ice has been recorded in some extreme environments including the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica, one of the best terrestrial analogues for Mars. In the frame of “Life in space” Italian astrobiology project, the polyextremophilic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus, a eukaryotic test organism isolated from the Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities, has been tested for its resistance, when grown on different hypersaline substrata. In addition, C. antarcticus was grown on Martian relevant perchlorate medium (0.4 wt% of Mg(ClO4)2 and 0.6 wt% of Ca(ClO4)2) to investigate the possibility for the fungus to survive in Martian environment. Here, the results indicate a good survivability and metabolic activity recovery of the black fungus when grown on four Martian relevant perchlorates. A low percentage of damaged cellular membranes have been found, confirming the ultrastructural investigation. Copyright © 2022 Cassaro, Pacelli and Onofri.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two strains of a psychrophilic basidiomycetous yeast species belonging to the genus Vishniacozyma were isolated from sediments and soil at the front of a retreating glacier on northern Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. Analysis of the large subunit D1/D2 region and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the rDNA indicated that these strains represented a novel species. The closest relatives of the novel species were Vishniacozyma globispora and V. dimennae, which exhibited sequence similarities of 82.2 and 81.6 %, respectively, to the ITS region of the novel species, and contained 61 and 57 nt substitutions, respectively, in the D1/D2 domain, in comparison with the novel species. Strains of the novel species were able to grow at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free medium. These characteristics allow the strains to survive and grow in perennially cold, oligotrophic habitats in the Canadian High Arctic. The name Vishniacozyma ellesmerensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JCM 32573               T               ( = UAMH 11973               T               = G3-4-8               T               ) and the MycoBank number is MB825501.             © 2019 IUMS.},

  ABSTRACT = {Soil microbes play important roles in global carbon and nutrient cycling. Soil microfungi are generally amongst the most important contributors. They produce various extracellular hydrolase enzymes that break down the complex organic molecules in the soil into simpler form. In this study, we investigated patterns of amylase and cellulase (which are responsible for breaking down starch and cellulose, respectively) relative activity (RA) on solid media at different culture temperatures in fungal strains from Arctic, Antarctic and tropical soils. Fungal isolates from all three regions were inoculated onto R2A media supplemented with starch for amylase and carboxymethylcellulose and trypan blue for cellulase screening. The isolates were then incubated at 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C and examined for activity after 5 and 10 days, for tropical and polar isolates, respectively. The data obtained indicate that the polar fungal strains exhibited similar patterns of amylase and cellulase RA. Both Arctic and Antarctic fungi showed highest RA for amylase and cellulase at 35 °C, while colony growth was maximised at 15 °C. Colony growth and RA of the polar isolates were negatively correlated suggesting that, as temperatures increase, the cells become stressed and have fewer resources available to invest in growth. Unlike polar isolates, tropical isolates did not exhibit any trend of colony growth with temperature, rather having idiosyncratic patterns in each isolate. The low enzyme production and RA levels in the tropical strains may suggest both a low ability to respond to temperature variation in their natural thermally stable tropical habitats, as well as a level of thermal stress limiting their enzyme production ability. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {The basidiomycetous yeast Moesziomyces antarcticus (often cited as Pseudozyma antarctica), originally isolated from a sediment sample obtained from Lake Vanda in Antarctica, was asexually typified but closely related to the smut fungus Moesziomyces bullatus (Ustilaginales). We found a smut fungus on an ovary of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) in Japan, which had been identified as M. bullatus. The teliospores germinated and formed yeast-like colonies. Physiological and phylogenetic studies revealed that the characteristics of the yeast-like isolates coincided with those of “P. antarctica.” We thus recognised the smut fungus as the teleomorph of M. antarcticus, and then emended the description of M. antarcticus based on the holomorph. The identified fungus could degrade certain biodegradable plastics and produce mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) in similar qualities as the “P. antarctica” type strain. This discovery provides a significant bioresource, as genetically diverse M. antarcticus isolates could be obtained from the smut fungus. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fungal endophyte associations have been suggested as a possible strategy of Antarctic vascular plants for surviving the extreme environmental conditions of Antarctica. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are still poorly understood. The role of root fungal endophytes in nitrogen mineralization and nutrient uptake, as well as their impact on the performance of Antarctic plants, were studied. We tested root endophytes, isolated from Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, for lignocellulolytic enzyme production, nitrogen mineralization, and growth enhancement of their host plants. Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium brevicompactum were identified using a molecular approach as the main root endophytes inhabiting C. quitensis and D. antarctica, respectively. Both root endophytes were characterized as psychrophilic fungi displaying amylase, esterase, protease, cellulase, hemicellulase, phosphatase and urease enzymatic activities, mainly at 4 °C. Moreover, the rates and percentages of nitrogen mineralization, as well as the final total biomass, were significantly higher in symbiotic C. quitensis and D. antarctica individuals. Our findings suggest that root endophytes exert a pivotal ecological role based not only to breakdown different nutrient sources but also on accelerating nitrogen mineralization, improving nutrient acquisition, and therefore promoting plant growth in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract—: Secondary metabolites of 25 Penicillium strains isolated from high-latitude ecosystems (upper layer of Antarctic soils and Arctic permafrost deposits) were analyzed. Out of the studied strains, 80% were found to produce secondary metabolites belonging to benzodiazepine alkaloids (anacin, cyclopenin, and cyclopeptin), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatin and 3-methoxyviridicatin), diketopiperazine alkaloids (aurantiamine, 3,12-dihydroroquefortine, roquefortine and rugulosuvin B), polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B and chаetoglobosine A), clavine ergot alkaloids (rugulovasins A and B, festuclavine, fumigaclavines A and B, and cyclopiazonic acid), polyketides (mycophenolic acid and citreoviridin), terpenes (andrastins A and B and phomenone), and N-acetyltriptamine. Most strains of the Penicillium subgenus isolated from anthropogenically impaired upper layers of Antarctic deposits and from subsurface Arctic deposits exhibited more complete spectra of secondary metabolites compared to three strains isolated from permafrost 15 000 to 600 000 years old. This is the first report on andrastins formation by a P. restrictum. Wide occurrence of rugulovasins in P. variabile strains was shown. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {The development of cold-active biofertilizers and biopesticides could help improve sustainable agriculture in mountainous regions. With this aim, both psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microorganisms have been prospected in cold regions around the world and tested for their plant-growth promoting (PGP) effects. Interestingly, very little is known about the PGP effects of polar microorganisms in commercial crops. This study aimed at isolating cold-active plant-growth promoting Pseudomonas spp. from Antarctic soils and testing their PGP effects, both in vitro and on wheat (Triticum aestivum). Twenty-five Pseudomonas spp. strains isolated from Antarctic soils at Greenwich Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctic Peninsula) were tested. The isolates grew well at temperatures ranging from 4 to 30 °C and were therefore considered as eury-psychrophiles. The isolates solubilized tri-calcium phosphate at 8 and 16 °C in the presence of different sugars as sole carbon sources. Besides producing indole-acetic acid, siderophores and hydrogen cyanide, several isolates inhibited growth of three plant pathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum, Pythium ultimum and Phytophtora infestans) by means of both soluble- and volatile-secondary metabolites. Bacterization of T. aestivum seeds with selected isolates significantly enhanced root elongation. Moreover, when grown in sterile soil and in a temperature-controlled growth chamber at 14 ± 1 °C, inoculated T. aestivum seedlings showed a significant increase in their root- and shoot-lengths compared to untreated controls. Overall, the results suggest that some of these Antarctic Pseudomonas spp. isolates could act as cold-active biofertilizers. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this study, we propose a new genus, Victoriomyces, with a new species, Victoriomyces antarcticus, isolated from soil samples collected in Victoria Land, Antarctica. To determine its taxonomic status and evolutionary relationships, phylogenetic analysis was performed on DNA sequences from the nuclear 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) genes. Victoriomyces antarcticus constitutes one well-supported distinct lineage within the Cephalothecaceae (family incertae sedis in Sordariomycetes), in which the only recognised asexual morphs belong to the genus Phialemonium and to Acremonium thermophilum. Victoriomyces antarcticus can be clearly distinguished from these taxa by means of DNA sequence analysis and its morphological traits that consist in having a Metarhizium-like asexual morph, dark red-coloured disk-like structures, immature bodies and the production of an intense red pigment in the growth media. Finally, we inferred the divergence time of V. antarcticus and the Cephalothecaceae using Bayesian analysis and secondary calibration. The holotype of V. antarcticus is FBL 165. The ex-type strain has been deposited as MUT 3686T and CCF 6158T. An additional strain of the species is FBL 577. The MycoBank number is MB 823713 for the genus and MB 823714 for the species. © 2019 IUMS.},

  ABSTRACT = {The feasibility of Penicillium sp. CHY-2 isolated from pristine Antarctic soil was evaluated for the remediation of 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP) contaminated soil. The strain CHY-2 completely degraded 4-t-BP present in the artificially contaminated soil within three weeks. Also, the number of indigenous bacteria and fungi present in the soil were analyzed at different time intervals using colony forming unit (CFU) analysis. The viable cell count of fungi were increased from day 10 to day 21 in the contaminated soil, and it was in accordance with the decrement of 4-t-BP concentration. The viable cell count of bacteria also increased with respect to time. The results suggested that the strain CHY-2 can be applied for the treatment of 4-t-BP contaminated soil. © 2020},

  ABSTRACT = {The Arctic and Antarctic share environmental extremes. To survive in such environments, microbes such as soil fungi need to compete with or protect themselves effectively from other soil microbiota and to obtain the often scarce nutrients available, and many use secondary metabolites to facilitate this. We therefore (i) screened for antimicrobial properties of cold-environment Arctic and Antarctic soil fungi, and (ii) identified changes in the secreted secondary metabolite profiles of a subset of these strains in response to temperature variation. A total of 40 polar soil fungal strains from King George Island, maritime Antarctic and Hornsund, Svalbard, High Arctic, were obtained from the Malaysian National Antarctic Research Centre culture collections. The plug assay technique was used to screen for antimicrobial potential against Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli). About 45% of the tested fungal strains showed antimicrobial activity against at least one tested microorganism. Three fungal isolates showed good bioactivity and were subjected to secondary metabolite profiling at different temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 28 °C). We observed a range of responses in fungal metabolite production when incubated at varying temperatures, confirming an influence of environmental conditions such as temperature on the production of secondary metabolites. © 2017},

  ABSTRACT = {This study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from Antarctica and assess its potential antibacterial activity on Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, the agent of citrus canker. Metabolites production was conducted in Malt 2% broth at 15°C for 20 days after which intracellular and extracellular extracts were obtained. The extracts were evaluated by cell viability assays through Resazurin Microtitre Assay. From 158 fungal extracts, 33 hampered bacterial growth in vitro. The average inhibition of the extracts obtained from terrestrial (soil) and marine (sediments) fungi was 94 and 97% respectively. These inhibition values were close to the average of 90% cell death for the positive control. MIC90 and MBC for the bioactive extracts were established. Isolates that produced active metabolites against the phytopathogen were identified using molecular taxonomy (ITS-rRNA sequencing) as: Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium, Cadophora, Paraconiothyrium and Toxicocladosporium. Antarctic fungal strains isolated from terrestrial and marine sediments were able to produce secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. citri subsp. citri, highlighting the importance of these microbial genetic resources. These metabolites have potential to be used as alternatives for the control of this plant pathogen. Significance and Impact of the Study: This manuscript makes an impact on the study of micro-organisms from extreme habitats and their possible contribution in discovering new active molecules against pathogens of agricultural interest. Studies on the Antarctic continent and its communities have attracted the scientific community due to the long period of isolation and low levels of disturbance that surrounds the region. Knowing the potential of fungi in this region to produce active secondary metabolites, we aim to contribute to the discovery of compounds with antibacterial action in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, a plant pathogen present in several regions around the globe. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

  ABSTRACT = {This study aims to obtain secondary metabolites extracts from filamentous fungi isolated from soil and marine sediments from Antarctic ecosystems and to assess its potential antibacterial activity on Xanthomonas euvesicatoria and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. passiflorae (phytopathogenic bacteria causing diseases in pepper and tomato and passionfruit, respectively). Among the 66 crude intracellular and extracellular extracts obtained from fungi recovered from soil and 79 obtained from marine sediment samples, 25 showed the ability to prevent the growth of X. euvesicatoria in vitro and 28 showed the ability to prevent the growth of X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae in vitro. Intracellular and extracellular extracts from soil fungi inhibited around 97% of X. euvesicatoria and 98% of X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae at 2·1 mg ml−1. The average inhibition rates against X. euvesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae for intracellular and extracellular extracts from marine sediments fungi were around 96 and 97%, respectively, at 3·0 mg ml−1. Extracts containing secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity against X. euvesicatoria and X. axonopodis pv. passiflorae were obtained, containing possible substitutes for the products currently used to control these phytopathogens. Significance and Impact of the Study: Micro-organisms from extreme ecosystems, such as the Antarctic ecosystem, need to survive in harsh conditions with low temperatures, low nutrients and high UV radiation. Micro-organisms adapt to these conditions evolving diverse biochemical and physiological adaptations essential for survival. All this makes these micro-organisms a rich source of novel natural products based on unique chemical scaffolds. Discovering novel bioactive compounds is essential because of the rise in antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms and the emergence of new infections. Fungi from Antarctic environments have been proven to produce bioactive secondary metabolites against various micro-organisms, but few studies have shown activity against Xanthomonas phytopathogens. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

  ABSTRACT = {A new black yeast species, Exophiala macquariensis is described that is a member of the ascomycete family Herpotrichiellaceae, order Chaetothyriales. The genus Exophiala is comprised of opportunistic pathogens isolated from clinical specimens as well as species recovered from hydrocarbon contaminated environments. Several species have been reported to be able to degrade benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. Here, a novel species of Exophiala (CZ06) previously isolated from a Sub-Antarctic, Macquarie Island soil that was spiked with Special Antarctic Blend diesel fuel (SAB) is described. This isolate has the capacity of toluene biodegradation at cold temperatures. Multilocus sequence typing showed that this fungus was closely related to the pathogenic species Exophiala salmonis and Exophiala equina. With the capacity to utilise hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source at 10 °C, this fungus has great potential for future bioremediation applications. © 2018 British Mycological Society},

Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that these strains are most closely related to the type strains of Mrakia aquatica and Mrakianic combsii, but with 8–9 and 7–12 nt substitutions in ITS and in the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene, respectively. The strains grew at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free media, with lipase and cellulase highly active even at 3°C. These characteristics likely allow this yeast species to grow and survive in extremely cold, oligotrophic environments, such as the fronts of retreating glaciers in the high Arctic.

  ABSTRACT = {During a survey of carotenogenic yeasts from cold and oligotrophic environments in Patagonia, several yeasts of the genus Dioszegia (Tremellales, Agaricomycotina) were detected, including three strains that could not be assigned to any known taxa. Analyses of internal transcribed spacer and D1/D2 regions of the large subunit rRNA gene showed these strains are conspecific with several other strains found in the Italian Alps and in Antarctica soil. Phylogenetic analyses showed that 19 of these strains represent a novel yeast species of the genus Dioszegia. The name Dioszegia patagonica sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate these strains and CRUB 1147T (UFMG 195T = CBMAI 1564T = DBVPG 10618T = CBS 14901T; MycoBank MB 819782) was designated as the type strain. This Dioszegia species accumulates biotechnologically valuable compounds such as carotenoid pigments and mycosporines. © 2017 IUMS.},

  ABSTRACT = {Five new highly oxygenated α-pyrone merosesquiterpenoids, ochraceopones A-E (1-5), together with one new double bond isomer of asteltoxin, isoasteltoxin (6), and two known asteltoxin derivatives, asteltoxin (7) and asteltoxin B (8), were isolated from an Antarctic soil-derived fungus, Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis SCSIO 05702. Their structures were determined through extensive spectroscopic analysis, CD spectra, quantum mechanical calculations, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. Ochraceopones A-D (1-4) are the first examples of α-pyrone merosesquiterpenoids possessing a linear tetracyclic carbon skeleton, which has not been previously described. All the isolated compounds were tested for their antiviral, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antitubercular activities. Among these compounds, ochraceopone A (1), isoasteltoxin (6), and asteltoxin (7) exhibited antiviral activities against the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses with IC50 values of >20.0/12.2 ± 4.10, 0.23 ± 0.05/0.66 ± 0.09, and 0.54 ± 0.06/0.84 ± 0.02 μM, respectively.

  ABSTRACT = {Urnula sp. was isolated as an endophyte of Dicksonia antarctica and identified primarily on the basis of its ITS sequence and morphological features. The anamorphic state of the fungus appeared as a hyphomyceteous-like fungus as based on its features in culture and scanning electron microscopy examination of its spores. On potato dextrose agar (PDA), the organism makes a characteristic fragrance resembling peach pie with vanilla overtones. A GC/MS analysis done on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of this organism, trapped by carbotrap methodology, revealed over 150 compounds with high MS matching quality being noted for 44 of these. Some of the most abundantly produced compounds included 4-decene, tridecane, 2-decene (E), 2-dodecene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, butanoic acid, pentyl ester, and 1-hexanol,2-ethyl. In addition, vanillin, methyl vanillin, and many other fragrant substances were noted including isomenthol, pyrazine derivatives, and 3-decanone. In split plate bioassay tests on potato dextrose agar (PDA), Botrytis cinerea, Ceratocystis ulmi, Pythium ultimum, Fusarium solani, and Rhizoctonia solani were inhibited at levels of 24 to 50% of their normal growth on this medium. Bioreactors supporting fungal growth on 50 g of beet pulp waste, using stainless steel carbotraps, yielded over 180 mg of hydrocarbon-based products collected over 6 weeks of incubation. Similarly, because this organism is making one of the largest sets of VOCs as any fungus examined to date, producing many compounds of commercial interest, it has enormous biotechnical potential. The role of the VOCs in the biology and ecology of this endophyte may be related to the antimicrobial activities that they possess. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  ABSTRACT = {In the present study, a fungal strain isolated from the Antarctic soil was identified as Penicillium sp. CHY-2 based on its 5.8S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Furthermore, its biodegradation ability towards 13 different toxic compounds such as 4-butylphenol (4-BP), 4-sec-butylphenol (4-s-BP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), phenol, bisphenol A (BPA), benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene at low (4°C) and medium (15°C) temperature conditions was evaluated using high pressure liquid chromatography. Among the 13 compounds, the strain CHY-2 effectively degraded the six compounds i.e., 4-BP, 4-s-BP, 4-t-BP, 4-NP, 4-CP, and phenol at 15°C within one week, and at 4°C within 3 weeks. Also CHY-2 effectively degraded the 4-t-OP at 15°C (70%), but not at 4°C (35%). Among different carbon sources tested, glucose was found to be the most suitable and the growth of CHY-2 at 4°C was slower than at 15°C. Addition of Tween 80 increased the growth and degradation ability of CHY-2 towards 4-BP at 4 and 15°C. The metabolites produced during the degradation of 4-BP were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Also, bacteria present in the Antarctic soil were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the result showed the presence of Pseudomonas and Syntrophus groups of bacteria. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  ABSTRACT = {The Polish Arctowski Station is situated in the maritime Antarctic on the western shore of Admiralty Bay and encompasses terrestrial habitats which are not permanently covered by ice, in contrast to more than 90% of the island’s surface area. Over the past several decades, studies exploring the soils of those habitats have revealed a considerable diversity of bacteria, filamentous fungi, and, to a lesser extent, yeasts; however, characterization of this complex microbiome, especially at the molecular level, is still far from satisfactory. The isolates were assigned to their respective genera and species based on genetic analysis of the D1/D2 and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions of rDNA. In the studied soil samples, the most abundant microorganisms belonged to the genera Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, and Debaryomyces. Physiological and biochemical analysis of Cryptococcus gilvescens (pro tempore Goffeauzyma gilvescens) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa showed only a limited level of intraspecies diversity. Cellular DNA content and karyotypes were determined using flow cytometry and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for several selected strains. For the first time, genome size and electrophoretic karyotypes were investigated in C. gilvescens (pro tem G. gilvescens), Cryptococcus saitoi (pro tem Naganishia globosa), Cryptococcus gastricus (pro tem Goffeauzyma gastrica), and Cryptococcus albidus (pro tem Naganishia albida). In addition, plate tests showed Antarctic yeasts to be a potential source of biotechnologically important enzymes. This study in biodiversity, presenting physiological and molecular characterization of psychrotolerant yeast strains isolated from the soils of western Admiralty Bay, contributes to a better understanding of the microbial ecology of this unique ecosystem. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  ABSTRACT = {In cold environments, biodegradation of organic pollutants and heavy metal bio-conversion requires the activity of cold-adapted or cold-tolerant microorganisms. In this work, the ability to utilize phenol, methanol and n-hexadecane as C source, the tolerance to different heavy metals and growth from 5 to 30 °C were evaluated in cold-adapted yeasts isolated from Antarctica. Fifty-nine percent of the yeasts were classified as psychrotolerant as they could grow in all the range of temperature tested, while the other 41% were classified as psychrophilic as they only grew below 25 °C. In the assimilation tests, 32, 78, and 13% of the yeasts could utilize phenol, n-hexadecane, and methanol as C source, respectively, but only 6% could assimilate the three C sources evaluated. In relation to heavy metals ions, 55, 68, and 80% were tolerant to 1 mM of Cr(VI), Cd(II), and Cu(II), respectively. Approximately a half of the isolates tolerated all of them. Most of the selected yeasts belong to genera previously reported as common for Antarctic soils, but several other genera were also isolated, which contribute to the knowledge of this cold environment mycodiversity. The tolerance to heavy metals of the phenol-degrading cold-adapted yeasts illustrated that the strains could be valuable as inoculant for cold wastewater treatment in extremely cold environments. © 2017, Springer Japan.},

  ABSTRACT = {Trichoderma species have the potential for application in composting as biological control agents in controlling disease and increasing yield of production in the agricultural industry. The prevalent soil fungus of Trichoderma produces lignocellulolytic enzymes that assist the degradation of woody lignocellulose materials. The aim of the experimental work was to check the potential of lignocellulolytic Trichoderma fungi for the use of rapid composting of oil palm empty fruit bunches fibers. Fifty-two of Trichoderma isolates from Sabah and seven isolates from Antarctic were examined for in-vitro lignocellulolytic activity by assaying their ability to develop dark brown pigments, yellow halo zone, and clear white zone on tannic acid media (TAM) for lignin; Jensen Media (JM) for cellulose; and modified Melin-Nokrans media (MMNM) for starch. The best six Sabah Trichoderma isolates (5D, 10L2, 10P, 5E, 10X, and 10E2) were found to be potential lignocellulolytic agents based on their diameter of halo zone formed on amended media for further testing of in vitro bioconversion of oil palm empty fruit bunches. The diameters of halo zones were measured for the analysis of their ability in degrading lignin, cellulose, and starch. In contrast, Antarctic Trichoderma isolates consistently exhibited lower lignocellulolytic activities based on their smaller diameter of halo zone formed on TAM, JM, and MMNM. Most of the Trichoderma isolates are found to synthesize polyphenol oxidase, endoglucanases, and are able to hydrolyze starch to glucose in the three different media. Thus, the finding shows the potential of these isolates for use in large-scale composting of oil palm empty fruit bunches. © 2014 Saili NS, et al.},

  ABSTRACT = {The aim of this work was to study the potential of the non-lignolytic filamentous fungus Penicillium sp. CHY-2, isolated from Antarctic soil, for the biodegradation of eight different aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as octane, decane, dodecane, ethylbenzene, butylbenzene, naphthalene, acenaphthene, and benzo[a]pyrene. Among all the compounds, CHY-2 showed the highest level of degradation for decane (49.0%), followed by butylbenzene (42.0%) and dodecane (33.0%), and lower levels of degradation for naphthalene (15.0%), acenaphthene (10.0%), octane (8.0%), ethylbenzene (4.0%), and benzo[a]pyrene (2.0%) at 20 °C. The addition of carbon sources such as glucose (5 g L-1) and Tween-80 (5 g L-1) enhanced decane degradation by about 1.8-fold and 1.61-fold respectively at 20 °C. The metabolites produced during the degradation of decane were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore, the enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP) from CHY-2 was purified. MnP was found to consist of monomers with a molecular mass of 36 kDa. The purified MnP had an optimum pH of 5.0 and temperature of 30 °C. The Km and Vmax values of MnP towards Mn2+ were 1.31 μM and 185.19 μM min-1 respectively. These results indicated that the strain CHY-2 can be used for the degradation of hydrocarbons and could have promising applications in treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated sites. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two new cold-adapted yeast species, Cystobasidium tubakii sp. nov. and Cystobasidium ongulense sp. nov., were isolated from soil collected from East Ongul Island, East Antarctica, during the 49th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE 49). Molecular analysis based on large subunit (LSU) D1/D2 domain and the combined sequences of small subunit (SSU) rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, LSU D1/D2 domain and TEF1 sequences showed that these species are novel. Both species could grow at sub-zero temperatures and in vitamin-free media. These characteristics were likely obtained by the yeasts to survive oligotrophic environments such as that in Antarctica. This is the first report of new fungal species isolated from near the Syowa station in the 60-y history of JARE. © 2016 The Mycological Society of Japan},

  ABSTRACT = {This study assessed the diversity and distribution of fungal communities associated with seven lichen species in the Ny-Ålesund Region (Svalbard, High Arctic) using Roche 454 pyrosequencing with fungal-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rRNA gene. Lichen-associated fungal communities showed high diversity, with a total of 42,259 reads belonging to 370 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being found. Of these OTUs, 294 belonged to Ascomycota, 54 to Basidiomycota, 2 to Zygomycota, and 20 to unknown fungi. Leotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes were the major classes, whereas the dominant orders were Helotiales, Capnodiales, and Chaetothyriales. Interestingly, most fungal OTUs were closely related to fungi from various habitats (e.g., soil, rock, plant tissues) in the Arctic, Antarctic and alpine regions, which suggests that living in association with lichen thalli may be a transient stage of life cycle for these fungi and that long-distance dispersal may be important to the fungi in the Arctic. In addition, host-related factors shaped the lichen-associated fungal communities in this region. Taken together, these results suggest that lichens thalli act as reservoirs of diverse fungi from various niches, which may improve our understanding of fungal evolution and ecology in the Arctic.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctic microorganisms have developed different strategies to live in their environments, including modifications to their membrane components to regulate fluidity and the production of photoprotective metabolites such as carotenoids. Three yeast colonies (ANCH01, ANCH06 and ANCH08) were isolated from soil samples collected at King George Island, which according to their rDNA sequence analyses, were determined to be Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. This yeast is of biotechnological interest, because it can synthesize astaxanthin as its main carotenoid, which is a powerful antioxidant pigment used in aquaculture. Then, the aim of this work was to characterize the ANCH isolates at their molecular and phenotypic level. The isolates did not display any differences in their rDNA and COX1 gene nucleotide sequences. However, ANCH01 produces approximately sixfold more astaxanthin than other wild type strains. Moreover, even though ANCH06 and ANCH08 produce astaxanthin, their main carotenoid was β-carotene. In contrast to other X. dendrorhous strains, the ANCH isolates did not produce mycosporines. Finally, the ANCH isolates had a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids than other wild type strains. In conclusion, the reported X. dendrorhous isolates are phenotypically different from other wild type strains, including characteristics that could make them more resistant and better able to inhabit their original habitat, which may also have biotechnological potential. © 2015, The Author(s).},

  ABSTRACT = {Space represents an extremely harmful environment for life and survival of terrestrial organisms. In the last decades, a considerable deal of attention was paid to characterize the effects of spaceflight relevant radiation on various model organisms. The aim of this study was to test the survival capacity of the cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 to space relevant radiation, to outline its endurance to space conditions. In the frame of an international radiation campaign, dried fungal colonies were irradiated with accelerated Helium ion (150 MeV/n, LET 2.2 keV/μm), up to a final dose of 1,000 Gy, as one of the space-relevant ionizing radiation. Results showed that the fungus maintained high survival and metabolic activity with no detectable DNA and ultrastructural damage, even after the highest dose irradiation. These data give clues on the resistance of life toward space ionizing radiation in general and on the resistance and responses of eukaryotic cells in particular. © 2017 Pacelli, Selbmann, Moeller, Zucconi, Fujimori and Onofri.},

  ABSTRACT = {Psychrotrophic yeasts were isolated from Antarctic soils, selected based on their ability to grow in apple juice at low temperatures, and were evaluated as potential biocontrol agents for the management of postharvest diseases of apple during cold storage. Among the species recovered, an isolate of Leucosporidium scottii, designated At17, was identified as a good biocontrol agent for blue and gray mold of two apple cultivars. The selected isolate produced soluble and volatile antifungal substances that were inhibitory to apple pathogens. Siderophore production was also demonstrated, but it did not appear to play a role in pathogen inhibition. The selected yeast had the capacity to form a biofilm when grown in apple juice, which is considered an important attribute of postharvest antagonists to successfully colonize wounds and intact fruit surfaces. At17 was resistant to commonly used postharvest fungicides, so application of a combination of low-dose fungicide along with the biocontrol agent could be used as an integrated management practice. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

Since conventional methods cannot be applied to these organisms, the effect on the genome was assessed by RAPD and rDNA amplification PCR based assays; the results were compared with the responses of Saccharomyces pastorianus DBVPG 6283 treated with the same conditions. Results showed that template activity was drastically inhibited in S. pastorianus after irradiation. Dramatic changes in the RAPD profiles showed after 30. min of exposure while the rDNA amplification of SSU, LSU, and ITS portions failed after 30, 60, and 90. min of exposure respectively. No alteration was detected in the templates of the Antarctic strains where both RAPD profiles and rDNA PCR amplifications were unaffected even after 240. min of exposure. The electroferograms of the rDNA portions of Cryomyces strains were perfectly readable and conserved whilst the analyses revealed a marked alteration in S. pastorianus confirming the high resistance of the Antarctic strains to UV-B exposure. © 2011 British Mycological Society.},

  ABSTRACT = {Few studies have addressed the diversity of cultivable fungi from marine sediments, especially those from Antarctica. In the present study, we evaluated the presence and distribution of cultivable fungi in marine core sediments obtained from 100, 500, 700 and 1,100 m below the Antarctic Ocean surface. Fifty-two fungal isolates were identified as Penicillium solitum by their physiological and morphological characteristics, and the identity of 12 representative isolates was further confirmed by sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and β-tubulin genes. P. solitum displayed high sequence similarity to Penicillium taxa that have been described from other marine habitats. Conidial germination of P. solitum occurred at low temperatures and high salinities. In addition, P. solitum displayed extracellular amylasic and esterasic activities. The isolation of P. solitum from marine sediments in Antarctica and its survival at low temperatures and high salt concentrations suggest that it is adapted to the cold and halophilic environment of the Antarctic oceans. Because P. solitum produces extracellular enzymes, it is an interesting eukaryotic model for the study of structure-function relationships during enzymatic biocatalysis and biotransformation under extreme conditions. Marine sediments from Antarctica may represent a unique source for obtaining extremophilic fungi. New studies using different culture media, temperatures ranges and pressure conditions as well as metagenomic techniques can assist in understanding the extremophilic fungal communities in marine sediments across the Antarctic Ocean. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

The strain is psychrotolerant with optimal growth temperature between 20°C and 28°C. During our continuous search for unique secondary metabolites, we have investigated an arctic isolate of Streptomyces avidinii SB9 and we found for the first time, that Sreptomyces avidinii strain SB9 produces 2-amino-3-dodecanol [1], norophthalmic acid (2S)-2-amino-4-[[(1S)-1-(carboxymethylcarbamoyl) ethyl]carbamoyl]butanoic acid [2] and phthalic acid ester [3]. The compounds were purified by solvent extraction, silica gel column chromatography and preparative TLC consecutively. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by NMR experiments and mass spectrometric investigations. These compounds showed antimicrobial activity against important Grampositive bacteria and fungi. Our studies are motivated by an interest in the functional role played by natural products in the ecological interactions of the strain with other members of the microbial community.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antarctica offers a range of extreme climatic conditions, such as low temperatures, high solar radiation and low nutrient availability, and constitutes one of the harshest environments on Earth. Despite that, it has been successfully colonized by 'cold-loving' fungi, which play a key role in decomposition cycles in cold ecosystems. However, knowledge about the ecological role of yeasts in nutrient or organic matter recycling/mineralization remains highly fragmentary. The aim of this work was to study the yeast microbiota in samples collected on 25 de Mayo/King George Island regarding the scope of their ability to degrade polyphenolic substrates such as lignin and azo dyes. Sixty-one yeast isolates were obtained from 37 samples, including soil, rocks, wood and bones. Molecular analyses based on rDNA sequences revealed that 35 yeasts could be identified at the species level and could be classified in the genera Leucosporidiella, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus, Bullera and Candida. Cryptococcus victoriae was by far the most ubiquitous species. In total, 33% of the yeast isolates examined showed significant activity for dye decolorization, 25% for laccase activity and 38% for ligninolytic activity. Eleven yeasts did not show positive activity in any of the assays performed and no isolates showed positive activity across all tested substrates. A high diversity of yeasts were isolated in this work, possibly including undescribed species and conspicuous Antarctic yeasts, most of them belonging to oligotrophic, slow-growing and metabolically diverse basidiomycetous genera. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {A fungal strain, Penicillium chrysogenum A096, was isolated from an Arctic sediment sample. Its culture supernatant inhibited mycelial growth of some plant pathogenic fungi. After saturation of P. chrysogenum A096 culture supernatant with ammonium sulfate and ion exchange chromatography, a novel antifungal protein (Pc-Arctin) was purified and identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS). The gene encoding for Pc-Arctin consisting of 195 nucleotides was cloned from P. chrysogenum A096 to confirm the mass spectrometry result. Pc-Arctin displays antifungal activity against Paecilomyces variotii, Alternaria longipes, and Trichoderma viride at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 24, 48, and 192 ng/disc, respectively. Pc-Arctin was most sensitive to proteinase K and then to trypsin but insensitive to papain. Pc-Arctin possesses high thermostability and cannot be antagonized by common surfactants, except for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Divalent ions, such as Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+, inhibited the antifungal activity of Pc-Arctin. Hemagglutination assays showed that Pc-Arctin had no hemagglutinating or hemolytic activity against red blood cells (RBC) from rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs. Therefore, Pc-Arctin from Arctic P. chrysogenum may represent a novel antifungal protein with potential for application in controlling plant pathogenic fungal infection. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two Gram-variable, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped, endospore-forming bacterial strains, M4-2T and M4-1, were isolated from soil samples collected from Oblast Magadan, Russian Far East, as micro-organisms antagonistic to the psychrophilic phytopathogenic fungus Typhula ishikariensis. Strains M4-2T and M4-1 were identified as members of the genus Paenibacillus by phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. The strains contained anteiso-C15:0 as the major fatty acid (63.0-64.7%) and MK-7 as the major isoprenoid quinone. The DNA G+C contents were 42.8 and 41.7 mol%, respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strains M4-2T and M4-1 exhibited high similarities with Paenibacillus macquariensis DSM 2T (99.5 and 99.7%, respectively) and Paenibacillus antarcticus LMG 22078T (99.4 and 99.5%, respectively). There were no clear differences in the phenotypic characteristics and chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data between the novel isolates and P. macquariensis DSM 2T. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments between strain M4-2T and P. macquariensis DSM 2T and P. antarcticus LMG 22078T revealed reassociation values of 56 and 49%, respectively. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed the differences between the new isolates and reference strains that were observed with the DNA-DNA hybridization studies. On the basis of the results described above, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel subspecies of P. macquariensis, Paenibacillus macquariensis subsp. defensor subsp. nov. The type strain is M4-2T ( = JCM 14954T = NCIMB 14397T). © 2009 IUMS.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fungi isolated from environmentally challenging habitats can have adaptations of potential value when developed as insect pest-controls. Fungal isolates collected from Antarctica, Geomyces sp. I, Geomyces sp. II, Mortierella signyensis and M. alpina, were investigated for (i) growth characteristics at 0-35°C, (ii) spore production at 10 and 20°C, (iii) viability following exposure to freezing temperatures, and (iv) insecticidal activity against waxmoths (Galleria mellonella L.), houseflies (Musca domestica L.), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.) and black vine weevils (Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fabricius). All isolates showed growth between 5-20°C, with some showing growth outside this range. Geomyces isolates sporulated over a wider range of conditions than the Mortierella isolates. Spore germination at 10°C was higher for Geomyces sp. II when this isolate was produced at 10 compared to 20°C (greatest difference 74.6 vs 32.7%). All isolates grew, with the exception of M. alpina, following exposure to -20°C for 4 weeks. Insecticidal investigations showed M. alpina and M. signyensis caused significant mortality of waxmoth and housefly larvae via injection and soil inoculation, and M. alpina caused significant mortality of housefly larvae via baiting; the Geomyces isolates had little lethal effect. © 2014 Edgington et al.; licensee Springer.},

  ABSTRACT = {Many filamentous fungi were isolated from the soils of Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and were screened in vitro for their phosphate solubilizing ability. Two strains of Aspergillus niger showed good tricalcium phosphate (TCP) solubilizing ability in Pikovskaya's medium. The TCP solubilization index was calculated at varying levels of pH and temperatures. The ability of Aspergillus niger strain-1 to solubilize and release inorganic-P was 285 μg ml -1, while Aspergillus niger strain-2 solubilized 262 μg ml -1 from 0.5% TCP after seven days. This is the first report of TCP solubilization by Arctic strains that may serve as very good phosphate solubilizers in the form of biofertilizer. © 2011 S.M. Singh et al.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Cellulose can be converted to ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The difference between the optimal temperature of cellulase and microbial fermentation, however, has been identified as the critical problem with SSF. In this study, one fungal strain (AnsX1) with high cellulase activity at low temperature was isolated from Antarctic soils and identified as Verticillium sp. by morphological and molecular analyses. Results: The biochemical properties of crude AnsX1 cellulase samples were studied by filter paper cellulase assay. The maximum cellulase activity was achieved at low temperature in an acidic environment with addition of metal ions. Furthermore, AnsX1 cellulase demonstrated 54-63% enzymatic activity at ethanol concentrations of 5-10%. AnsX1 cellulase production was influenced by inoculum size, carbon and nitrogen sources, and elicitors. The optimal culture conditions for AnsX1 cellulase production were 5% inoculum, wheat bran as carbon source, (NH4)2SO4 as nitrogen source, and sorbitol added in the medium. Conclusions: Our present work has potential to enable the development of an economic and efficient cold-adapted cellulase system for bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels in future.},

  ABSTRACT = {The psychrotolerant yeast Mrakia frigida 2E00797 isolated from sea sediment in Antarctica was found to be able to produce killer toxin against the pathogenic yeast (Metschnikowia bicuspidata WCY) in crab. When the psychrotolerant yeast was grown in the medium with pH 4.5 and 3.0% (wt/vol) NaCl and at 15°C, it could produce the highest amount of killer toxin against the pathogenic yeast M. bicuspidata WCY. The crude killer toxin activity against the pathogenic yeast M. bicuspidata WCY was the highest when it grew at 15°C in the assay medium with 3.0% (wt/vol) NaCl and pH 4.5. At temperatures higher than 25°C, the killing activity produced by M. frigida 2E00797 was completely lost and after the crude killer toxin was pre-incubated at temperatures higher than 40°C for 4 h, the killing activity was also completely lost. The killer toxin produced by M. frigida 2E00797 could kill only M. bicuspidata WCY, Candida tropicalis and Candida albicans among all the fungal species and bacterial species tested in this study. © 2010 Springer.},

  ABSTRACT = {Soil filamentous fungi from Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen, were studied. A total of 30 fungal isolates were identified by morpho-taxonomy, and the identity of some morpho-taxonomically complex isolates was authenticated by ITS1-5.8S and ITS2 rDNA domain sequence similarity. The isolates belonged to 19 species under 14 genera (Acremonium, Arthrinium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Corynespora, Emericella, Geomyces, Mortierella, Mucor, Myrothecium, Penicillium, Phialophora, Preussia, Xylaria). To the best of our knowledge, Acremonium roseolum, Aspergillus aculeatus, Emericella nidulans, and Preussia sp. are the first northernmost records from Arctic soils. The viable fungal count in different soil samples varied from 0.5 × 104 to 2.0 × 105 g-1. Species richness in different soil samples was also calculated. Mortierella was one of the most dominant genera in Arctic soils. A temperature tolerance study was carried out for all the isolates, and representative species were screened for their extracellular enzyme activity (amylase, cellulase, phosphatase, and pectinase) at 4°C and 20°C. Among the 30 isolates, seven showed cellulolytic activity, two were phosphate solubilizers, three had amylolytic activity, and only one showed pectinolytic activity on solid media. CMCase (β1, 4-endoglucanase) activity was quantified in seven isolates that exhibited positive activity during preliminary screening. The records of enzyme activity for amylases, pectinases, and cellulases are the first from the fungi of Spitsbergen. The present study indicates the dominance in Ny-Ålesund of cellulolytic strains, which may serve as potent decomposers in Arctic tundra. These isolates may be used to facilitate the mineralization of cellulolytic wastes generated by human activities in colder hilly areas across the world, including the Himalayas in India. © The Arctic Institute of North America.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract: Growth and respiration of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with dwarf shrubs likely contribute significantly to carbon cycling in arctic tundra soils dominated by this vegetation type. Despite their importance little is known about how these fungi might respond to global warming. While previous studies have shown that some ectomycorrhizal fungi can tolerate or retain viability across a fairly wide range of temperatures little is known regarding their metabolic responses to temperature shifts. The present study was undertaken to examine the comparative physiological responses in vitro of arctic and temperate isolates of a common ectomycorrhizal fungus to shifts in growth temperature. Isolates of Cenococcum geophilum from Alaska and Maryland were grown at 12 and 20°C in liquid culture to study the process of temperature acclimation. Measurements on each isolate at the two growth temperatures included linear growth rates, dry weight accumulation, oxygen consumption and the specific activities of the soluble enzymes glucokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In addition the response to growth temperature of glucokinase kinetic parameters (Ea, Km and Vmax) were also evaluated. Increasing the growth temperature tended to decrease the length of the observed lag phase; however, the growth rates in dry weight at 20°C closely paralleled those at 20°C. Both isolates demonstrated lower respiration rates when grown at 20 versus 12°C. Thus for oxygen uptake each isolate demonstrated a phenotypic response known as ideal rate compensation. That is growth at 20°C resulted in oxygen uptake rates at 20°C that were similar to those measured at 12°C for 12°C-grown mycelium. This strategy, if common in ectomycorrhizal fungi, would reduce the expected carbon demand placed on the host and decrease the amount of carbon dioxide released by respiration in response to anticipated increases in soil temperatures. Differences in overall respiration rates by 12 and 20°C grown mycelium could not be explained by changes in activities of soluble enzymes examined. Likewise few differences were observed in glucokinase kinetic parameters associated with growth temperature. Examination of soluble enzyme activity ratios as influenced by growth temperature suggests the potential exists to alter relative fluxes through primary metabolic pathways and warrants further investigation. Future studies of temperature acclimation should examine a wider range of ectomycorrhizal fungi and employ techniques such as DNA microarrays and metabolomics. © 2010 Pacific Northwest Fungi Project.},

  ABSTRACT = {The diversity of yeasts collected from different sites in Antarctica (Admiralty Bay, King George Island and Port Foster Bay and Deception Island) and their ability to produce extracellular enzymes and mycosporines were studied. Samples were collected during the austral summer season, between November 2006 and January 2007, from the rhizosphere of Deschampsia antarctica, ornithogenic (penguin guano) soil, soil, marine and lake sediments, marine water and freshwater from lakes. A total of 89 isolates belonging to the following genera were recovered: Bensingtonia, Candida, Cryptococcus, Debaryomyces, Dioszegia, Exophiala, Filobasidium, Issatchenkia (Pichia), Kodamaea, Leucosporidium, Leucosporidiella, Metschnikowia, Nadsonia, Pichia, Rhodotorula, and Sporidiobolus, and the yeast-like fungi Aureobasidium, Leuconeurospora and Microglossum. Cryptococcus victoriae was the most frequently identified species. Several species isolated in our study have been previously reported to be Antarctic psychophilic yeasts, including Cr. antarcticus, Cr. victoriae, Dioszegia hungarica and Leucosporidium scottii. The cosmopolitan yeast species A. pullulans, C. zeylanoides, D. hansenii, I. orientalis, K. ohmeri, P. guilliermondii, Rh. mucilaginosa, and S. salmonicolor were also isolated. Five possible new species were identified. Sixty percent of the yeasts had at least one detectable extracellular enzymatic activity. Cryptococcus antarcticus, D. aurantiaca, D. crocea, D. hungarica, Dioszegia sp., E. xenobiotica, Rh. glaciales, Rh. laryngis, Microglossum sp. 1 and Microglossum sp. 2 produced mycosporines. Of the yeast isolates, 41.7% produced pigments and/or mycosporines and could be considered adapted to survive in Antarctica. Most of the yeasts had extracellular enzymatic activities at 4°C and 20°C, indicating that they could be metabolically active in the sampled substrates.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fumarolic Ice caves on Antarctica's Mt. Erebus contain a dark oligotrophic volcanic ecosystem (DOVE and represent a deep biosphere habitat that can provide insight into microbial communities that utilize energy sources other than photosynthesis. The community assembly and role of fungi in these environments remains largely unknown. However, these habitats could be relatively easily contaminated during human visits. Sixty-one species of fungi were identified from soil clone libraries originating from Warren Cave, a DOVE on Mt. Erebus. The species diversity was greater than has been found in the nearby McMurdo Dry Valleys oligotrophic soil. A relatively large proportion of the clones represented Malassezia species (37% of Basidomycota identified. These fungi are associated with skin surfaces of animals and require high lipid content for growth, indicating that contamination may have occurred through the few and episodic human visits in this particular cave. These findings highlight the importance of fungi to DOVE environments as well as their potential use for identifying contamination by humans. The latter offers compelling evidence suggesting more strict management of these valuable research areas. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  ABSTRACT = {During a survey of the culturable soil fungal population in samples collected in Taylor Valley, South Victoria Land, Antarctica, 13 basidiomycetous yeast strains with orange-coloured colonies were isolated. Phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial LSU rRNA gene sequences showed that the strains belong to the Dioszegia clade of the Tremellales (Tremellomycetes, Agaricomycotina), but did not correspond to any of the hitherto recognized species. Two novel species, Dioszegia antarctica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-116T = CBS 10920T = PYCC 5970 T) and Dioszegia cryoxerica sp. nov. (type strain ANT-03-071 T = CBS. 10919T = PYCC 5967T), are described to accommodate ten and three of these strains, respectively. Analysis of ITS sequences demonstrated intrastrain sequence heterogeneity in D. cryoxerica. The latter species is also notable for producing true hyphae with clamp connections and haustoria. However, no sexual structures were observed. The two novel species can be considered obligate psychrophiles, since they failed to grow above 20 °C and grew best between 10 and 15 °C. © 2010 IUMS.},

  ABSTRACT = {We tested the effects of solar radiation, and UV-B in particular, on the growth of Antarctic terrestrial fungi. The growth responses to solar radiation of five fungi, Geomyces pannorum, Phoma herbarum, Pythium sp., Verticillium sp., and Mortierella parvispora, each isolated from Antarctic terrestrial habitats, were examined on an agar medium in the natural Antarctic environment. A 3-h exposure to solar radiation of >287 nm reduced the hyphal extension rates of all species relative to controls kept in the dark. Pythium sp. cultures exposed to solar radiation for 1.5 h on five consecutive days were most sensitive to radiation of >287 nm, but radiation of >313 nm also inhibited growth to a lesser extent. Radiation of >400 nm had no effect on hyphal growth relative to controls kept in the dark. Short-wave solar UV-B radiation of between 287 and 305 nm inhibited the growth of Pythium sp. hyphae on and below the surface of the agar medium after 24 h, but radiation of ≥345 nm only reduced the growth of surface hyphae. Similar detrimental effects of UV-B on surface and, to a lesser extent, submerged hyphae of all five fungi were shown in the laboratory by using artificial UV-B from fluorescent lamps. A comparison of growth responses to solar radiation and temperature showed that the species that were most resistant to UV radiation grew fastest at higher temperatures. These data suggest that solar UV-B reduces the growth of fungi on the soil surface in the Antarctic terrestrial environment.},

  ABSTRACT = {The filamentous fungus Phoma herbarum CCFEE 5080 isolated from continental Antarctica soil was tested for exopolysaccharide (EPS) production. The fungus grew and produced EPS (up to13.6 g/l) on a variety of carbon sources among which sorbitol was best, particularly at the concentration of 60 g/l. EPS production was maximum when the nitrogen source was NaNO3 (3 g/l) and the incubation temperature was 28°C. The polysaccharide was purified by repeated precipitation in ethanol and gel filtration and characterized as a homopolymer of glucose having a molecular weight of 7.412×106; structural analysis indicated the presence of β-1,3 and β-1,6 linkages only. After repeated freezing and thawing of the fungal biomass in the presence of EPS, the mycelial growth was much higher than that observed after freezing in the absence of EPS and the difference increased with the number of freeze-thaw cycles. It is hypothesized that the adaptation of P. herbarum CCFEE 5080 to the Antarctic soil microclimatic conditions, characterized by low temperature, high thermal fluctuations and repeated freeze-thaw cycles, might be related to the EPS production ability. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Growth responses of Alternaria alternata, Chrysosporium pannorum, Nectria peziza, Thelebolus microsporus, Mycelia sterile and Phoma cf. herbarum to temperature, pH and culture media were investigated. Maximum growth occurred after 16 days, except in Nectria peziza and Thelebolus microsporus, where maximum growth occurred 12 days after inoculation. All isolates showed poor growth at 0°C. Maximum growth was obtained with temperatures ranging from 15 to 25°C. The optimum temperature for all fungi was 20°C. An acid medium favoured growth. Chrysosporium pannorum, Phoma cf. herbarum and Nectria peziza grew best at pH 3-4, whereas Mycelia sterile, Alternaria alternata and Thelebolus microsporus grew best at pH 5-6. The culture medium had little effect on growth, except for nutrient agar, which showed poor growth against all isolates with the exception of Thelebolus microsporus.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ectomycorrhizal fungi have been shown to survive sub-zero temperatures in axenic culture and in the field. However, the physiological basis for resistance to freezing is poorly understood. In order to survive freezing, mycelia must synthesise compounds that protect the cells from frost damage, and certain fungal-specific soluble carbohydrates have been implicated in this role. Tissue concentrations of arabitol, mannitol and trehalose were measured in axenic cultures of eight Hebeloma strains of arctic and temperate origin grown at 22, 12, 6 and 2°C. In a separate experiment, mycelia were frozen to -5°C after pre-conditioning at either 2°C or 22°C. For some, especially temperate strains, there was a clear increase in specific soluble carbohydrates at lower growth temperatures. Trehalose and mannitol were present in all strains and the highest concentrations (close to 2.5% and 0.5% dry wt.) were recorded only after a cold period. Arabitol was found in four strains only when grown at low temperature. Cold pre-conditioning enhanced recovery of mycelia following freezing. In four out of eight strains, this was paralleled by increases in mannitol and trehalose concentration at low temperature that presumably contribute towards cryoprotection. The results are discussed in an ecological context with regard to mycelial overwintering in soil.},

All strains tested had the capacity to assimilate amino acids and generally utilized alanine and glutamic acid more readily than NH4+. Some strains were able to utilize amino C when starved of glucose C, and could mineralize amino-N to NH3-N. Arctic strains, in particular, appeared to be pre-adapted to the utilization of seed protein N and glutamic acid N, which is often liberated in high concentrations after soil freezing. The results are discussed in relation to their possible ecological importance.},

The production of the alkaloids by the fungus showed a biphasic behavior, being intense in the phase of active growth and slowing down in the adaptive lag phase and in the stationary growth phase. The addition of zinc ions to the incubation medium led to a fivefold increase in the yield of the alkaloids. The alkaloid-producing Penicillium fungi isolated from different regions exhibited the same tendencies of growth and alkaloid production.},

  ABSTRACT = {Little is known about the effects of hydrocarbons and fuel oil on Antarctic filamentous fungi in the terrestrial Antarctic environment. Growth of fungi and bacteria from soils around Rothera Research Station (Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula) was assessed in the presence of ten separate aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons [marine gas oil (MGO), dodecane, hexadecane, benzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, toluene, phenol, biphenyl, naphthalene and m- and p-xylenes with ethylbenzene]. Aromatic hydrocarbons inhibited soil microbial growth more than aliphatic hydrocarbons. Soil microorganisms from a moss patch, where little previous impact or hydrocarbon contamination had occurred, were less tolerant of hydrocarbons than those from high impact sites. Fungal growth rates of Mollisia sp., Penicillium commune, Mortierella sp., Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma sp. and Phoma herbarum were assessed in the presence of hydrocarbons. Generally, aromatic hydrocarbons inhibited or stopped hyphal extension, though growth rates increased with some aliphatic hydrocarbons. Hyphal dry weight measurements suggested that Mortierella sp. may be able to use dodecane as sole carbon and energy source. Hydrocarbon-degrading Antarctic fungi may have use in future hydrocarbon spill bioremediation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Cryptoendolithic microbial communities, living in porous sandstone rocks in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Ross Desert) of Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, were found within weathered pegmatite rocks in Northern Victoria Land, and the first endemic Antarctic fungal genus Friedmanniomyces endolithicus anam.-gen. and sp. nov. was isolated from this community. Selected microfungi from these communities and from soil were examined for the production of extracellular enzymes and antibiotic substances. The cryptoendolithic strain CCFEE 5001 was particularly remarkable for consistent glycosidase activity, coupled with barely detectable growth. Chitinase activity was highest in the soil mi-crofungus Verticillium cfr. lecanii (CCFEE 5003). This strain and its purified chitinase were active on Mucor plumbeus, Cladospori-um cladosporioides, Aspergillus versicolor, and Penicillium verrucosum, producing mycelial damage and cell lysis. The strain CCFEE 5020, isolated from rocks, showed antibiotic activity against Pseudomonas putida, Sarcina sp., Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli, under the test conditions. Good antibiotic activity was produced in the temperature range of 5° to 25° C, pH 4.0, agitation at 700 rpm, and areation at 1.0 vvm, in media containing 0.5% substrate sugar, though this supported only minimal growth. The investigation of soil microfungi in contrasting sites at the BIOTAS area at Edmonson Point indicated that both the presence of bird colonies and changes in temperature and UV exposure obtained by using plastic cloches influenced species composition and density. A ‘Culture Collection of Fungi from Extreme Environments’ (CCFEE) has been established at the University of Tuscia, housing fungal strains from Antarctica. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

  ABSTRACT = {Comparative characterization of Geomyces isolates was performed. The isolates were obtained from Arctic cryopegs and the surrounding ancient marine deposits, from nonsaline permafrost soils, and from temperate environments. Microbiological (cultural and morphological) and molecular criteria were used to confirm the identification of the isolates as Geomyces pannorum. The isolates from cryopegs and surrounding marine deposits were shown to differ from those obtained from nonsaline soils and temperate environments in their ability to grow at negative temperatures (-2°C) under increased salt concentration (10%). The results are discussed in relation to the possible inheritance of the adaptive characteristics acquired in specific environments. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mats of coenocytic "snow molds" are commonly observed covering the soil and litter of alpine and subalpine areas immediately following snow melt. Here, we describe the phylogenetic placement, growth rates, and metabolic potential of cold-adapted fungi from under-snow mats in the subalpine forests of Colorado. SSU rDNA sequencing revealed that these fungi belong to the zygomycete orders Mucorales and Mortierellales. All of the isolates could grow at temperatures observed under the snow at our sites (0°C and -2°C) but were unable to grow at temperatures above 25°C and were unable to grow anaerobically. Growth rates for these fungi were very high at -2°C, approximately an order of magnitude faster than previously studied cold-tolerant fungi from Antarctic soils. Given the rapid aerobic growth of these fungi at low temperatures, we propose that they are uniquely adapted to take advantage of the flush of nutrient that occurs at the soil-snow interface beneath late winter snow packs. In addition, extracellular enzyme production was relatively high for the Mucorales, but quite low for the Mortierellales, perhaps indicating some niche separation between these fungi beneath the late winter snow pack. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Each of these fungi responded differently to suboptimal growth temperatures. At low temperatures Humicola marvinii accumulated cryoprotective carbohydrates (trehalose intracellularly and glycerol extracellularly), whereas Geomyces pannorum responded by altering its lipid composition with increases in unsaturated lipid content and overall unsaturation index. In the case of Mortierella elongata, features that may influence its ability to grow at low temperatures included the absence of detectable ergosterol, the presence of stearidonic acid and increased amounts of intracellular trehalose when grown at lower temperatures. The relative importance of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in adaptation to temperature stress in these fungi is discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Among 97 fungal strains isolated from soil collected in the arctic tundra (Spitsbergen), Penicillium chrysogenum 9′ was found to be the best lipase producer. The maximum lipase activity was 68 units mL-1 culture medium on the fifth day of incubation at pH 6.0 and 20°C. Therefore, P. chrysogenum 9′ was classified as a psychrotrophic microorganism. The non-specific extracellular lipase showed a maximum activity at 30°C and pH 5.0 for natural oils or at pH 7.0 for synthetic substrates. Tributyrin was found to be the best substrate for lipase, among those tested. The K m and V max were calculated to be 2.33 mM and 22.1 units mL-1, respectively, with tributyrin as substrate. The enzyme was inhibited more by EDTA than by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and was reactivated by Ca 2+. The P. chrysogenum 9′ lipase was very stable in the presence of hexane and 1,4-dioxane at a concentration of 50%, whereas it was unstable in presence of xylene. © Society for Industrial Microbiology 2005.},

  ABSTRACT = {Twenty-five isolates of F. acuminatum, 38 of F. avenaceum, 1 of F. culmorum, 31 of F. oxysporum and 56 of F. sambucinum were obtained in 1983, 1984 and 1986 from cereal grains and soil from various parts of Norway. The isolates were grown on an autoclaved Uncle Ben's parboiled rice medium and examined for production of trichothecenes and other toxins and for toxicity in rat feeding tests. F. culmorum N46C(2) and Fusarium sambucinum 45-86-A produced zearalenone (F-2) 864 and 665 ppm, respectively and caused uterine enlargement in rats. Most of these isolates produced no known trichothecene mycotoxins that could account for the toxicity that was demonstrated in the rat feeding tests. All but F. avenaceum N26B produced fusarin C (1.5 ppm) but caused no toxic effects in rat feeding test. None of the isolates produced fusarochromanone (TDP-1). Thirteen isolates of F. acuminatum, 16 of F. avenaceum, 14 of F. oxysporum and 3 of F. sambucinum produced a cytotoxic factor which we named HM-8. One isolate of F. avenaceum, 12 of F. oxysporum and 46 of F. sambucinum produced a hemorrhagic factor which we named H-1 (wortmannin). Twenty isolates of F. acuminatum, 22 of F. avenaceum, 17 of F. oxysporum and 1 of F. sambucinum produced moniliformin. Four isolates of F. acuminatum, 9 of F. avenaceum, 25 of F. oxysporum and 52 of F. sambucinum caused death to rats. Three isolates of F. avenaceum, 19 of F. oxysporum and 47 of F. sambucinum induced hemorrhage in various organs. All isolates caused decreased weight gain, relative to the control diets. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

  ABSTRACT = {According to earlier observations, severe UV irradiation kills all micro-organisms in a chamber with simulated Martian conditions. However, even a thin soil layer protects buried micro-organisms from UV irradiation. The chief limiting factor for microbial multiplication under simulated Martian conditions seems to be soil humidity. Several micro-organisms were isolated from harsh environments (e.g., from Arctic, Antarctic desert and high-mountain soil samples). A strain of an oligonitrophilic mycococcus, isolated from Dixon Island, proved to be most resistant to low humidity. It multiplied in a mixture of limonite (maximal hygroscopical humidity 3.8%) + 2% (w/w) garden soil kept in a chamber simulating Martian conditions. Total cell count increased 7.6-fold and, in some experiments, 26-fold in 14 days. The oligonitrophilic mycococcus was able to grow even at a humidity level of 2.5%, that is less than maximal hygroscopical (3.8%). Under these conditions cell count increased 10-fold in 36 days. Thus, it was shown that even in Earth soils there are xerophytic micro-organisms which are able to multiply in limonite of low humidity. These data might correct our current concepts concerning microbial water requirements. One might speculate that Martian micro-organisms belong to xerophytic species.},

  ABSTRACT = {The linear growth rates of fungal isolates were measured on agar plates at temperatures ranging from 4° to 35°C. Fungi tested included the major fungal colonizers of leaves and litter of the three dominant plant species on subantarctic Macquarie Island, and major fungal species associated with plant and soil communities near Australia's Casey Station on the Antarctic Continent. All fungi grew at 4°C and were classified as psychrotrophs. Maximum growth rates were recorded at temperatures of 10° to 20°C for 13 of the 15 isolates from Macquarie Island and for all six isolates from Casey. Most of the leaf colonizing fungi from Macquarie Island had optimum growth temperatures of 15°C whereas all litter fungi from Macquarie Island and Casey fungi except Thelebolus microsporus had optimum growth temperatures of 20°C or above. Maximum growth of all species was at temperatures above those normally prevailing in their natural environments, with most species growing at 4°C at between 10% and 30% of their maximum rates. However, microclimatic effects may have resulted at times in temperatures near their growth optima. The highest growth rates at 4°C were recorded for Phoma spp. 1 and 2, Phoma exigua and Mortierella gamsii from Macquarie Island and Mortierella sp. 1 from Casey. Thelebolus microsporus and sterile sp. G from Casey also grew relatively fast at 4°C, and these species, and Phoma sp. 3 and Phoma exigua from Macquarie Island had the lowest Q-10 values for the temperature range 4° to 15°C. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {Antibiotic C3368-A (CA) is produced by a fungus strain from a soil sample collected in Antarctica. CA markedly inhibited radiolabeled thymidine and uridine transport in mouse Ehrlich carcinoma cells, its 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) being 4.6 and 7.7 μM, respectively. In clonogenic assay, CA displayed a synergistic effect with methotrexate (MTX), mitomycin C (MMC), 5-fluorouracil (5FU), and Adriamycin (ADR) against human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB cells. CA also markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect of 5FU and ADR on the proliferation of human hepatoma BEL-7402 cells as determined by the p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (NAG) enzyme-reaction assay. 5FU or ADR cytotoxicity was not augmented by CA in human fetal lung 2BS cells. In vivo, CA significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of MMC against colon carcinoma 26 in mice. No significant augmentation of toxicity by the combination was found in treated mice. The results suggest that CA, the newly found nucleoside-tranport inhibitor, may be useful in potentiation of the effect of antitumor drugs. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

  ABSTRACT = {The environmental conditions prevailing on Mars would supposedly favour the existence there of micro-organisms belonging to xerophiles, anaerobes, or micro-aerophiles, oligonitrophiles, which are able to grow in wide temperature intervals. From soil samples taken in deserts and tundra, antarctic halophilic bacteria, able to grow in liquid media containing 20-25% of sodium chloride, were isolated. Some of these cultures appeared to be also osmophilic (growth on media with 50% glucose); they grew at temperatures from 5 degrees C to 50 degrees C, and developed on media without a nitrogen source (oligonitrophiles). Of special interest was the halophilic and osmophilic form of Bacillus megaterium isolated from the Nubian desert. In experiments with this bacterium the following technique was used. A thin film of potato extract agar was prepared on a glass slide and dried over a saturated K2SO4 solution in a closed container up to the level of maximal hygroscopic moisture. The cell suspension was then sprayed on to the agar surface, the film dried again at 45 degrees C, and the glass slide put in the test tube over the saturated solution of K2SO4. The test tube was evacuated, flushed three times with a gas mixture containing 80% CO2 plus 20% Ar, and sealed. Under these conditions the water content of the agar film was equal to the maximal hygroscopic moisture; only the xerophilic form of bacteria are able to develop at this moisture level. This halophilic strain of Bac. megaterium grew satisfactorily under these conditions, as did a halophilic and osmophilic strain of Mycococcus ruber isolated in Antarctica. Both the halophilic strain of Bac. megaterium and that of M. ruber were able to grow under simulated Martian conditions. Xerophily and halophily may be linked. This assumption was supported by relatively high incidence of xerophilic forms among halophilic bacteria isolated from different soils of both high and low salt content as well as from salty muds.},

  ABSTRACT = {Thirty-three fungal strains, isolated from different sites on Victoria Land (continental Antarctica), were plate-screened for their ability to produce twelve extracellular enzymes. Lipases were generally present and in high quantities in almost all the strains. Polygalacturonase, as well as amylase and phosphatase, was common. Glucose oxidase, protease and DNAase appeared to be generally low or absent. Many strains, producing a limited number of enzymes, appeared to have a low eco-nutritional versatility while a few, such as Verticillium cfr. lecanii no. 1, V. cfr. lecanii no. 3. Aspergillus versicolor and Phoma sp. no. 2, showing a diversified enzymatic competence, are probably advantaged in extreme terrestrial environments characterized by low competition. The possibility of utilizing the enzyme-producing ability of these fungi in applied research is also discussed.},
